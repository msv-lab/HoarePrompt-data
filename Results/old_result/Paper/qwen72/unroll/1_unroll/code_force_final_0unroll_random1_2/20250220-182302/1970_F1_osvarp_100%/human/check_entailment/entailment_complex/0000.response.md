Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the dimensions of the grid (`n` and `m`), the initial grid layout, and the number of steps (`t`). It initializes the `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` correctly based on the input.
   - The `elements` dictionary correctly maps each unique element (players, goals, Quaffle) to its initial position.
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary correctly tracks whether a player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list correctly stores the positions of the goals for each team.

2. **Processing Commands**:
   - The function processes each command over `t` time steps.
   - For commands with three parts (player, action, ball), it correctly handles the player catching the Quaffle and updates the `allPlayers` dictionary.
   - For commands with two parts (player, action), it correctly handles the player moving, throwing the Quaffle, and checking for goals.
   - The function correctly prints the events when a player is eliminated, a goal is scored, or the Golden Snitch is caught.
   - The function correctly updates the `points` list when a goal is scored and prints the appropriate event message.

3. **Goal Scoring and Quaffle Reset**:
   - The function `goalIn` correctly determines if a position is a goal for the red or blue team.
   - When a player scores a goal, the function correctly updates the score and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.

4. **Final Score Output**:
   - After processing all commands, the function correctly prints the final score.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly by awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The function ensures that the Quaffle is only caught and thrown by players, and it correctly updates the Quaffle's position.

6. **Consistency and Validity**:
   - The function maintains the state of the game consistently, ensuring that players and the Quaffle move according to the rules.
   - The function correctly handles all valid actions and updates the game state accordingly.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to meet the problem description and handle all the required scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
