Output State: `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the current `minn` value (if `arr[i]` is positive) or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` (if `arr[i]` is non-positive). `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been added to the `used` dictionary. `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.
