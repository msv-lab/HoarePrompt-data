The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, and `q`, and two lists `a` and `b` of integers. It then processes `q` queries, where each query is an integer `ql`. For each query, the function calculates and prints an integer value based on the positions and differences in the lists `a` and `b`. The function does not modify the input variables and prints the results directly to the standard output.
