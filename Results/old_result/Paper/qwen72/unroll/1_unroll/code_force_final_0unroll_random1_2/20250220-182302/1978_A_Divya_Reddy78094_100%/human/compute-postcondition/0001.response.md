The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the parameter `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, so it doesn't need to be explicitly set before the loop starts, but it will start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
