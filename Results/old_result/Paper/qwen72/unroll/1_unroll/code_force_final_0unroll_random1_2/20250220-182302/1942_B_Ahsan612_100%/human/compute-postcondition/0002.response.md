The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the input list of integers.

The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information. Given the constraints and the typical nature of such problems, the function is likely to return a list of results, one for each test case, where each result is based on some computation involving the list `a` and the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). For each test case, it returns a result based on the input list `a` and the integer `n`.**
