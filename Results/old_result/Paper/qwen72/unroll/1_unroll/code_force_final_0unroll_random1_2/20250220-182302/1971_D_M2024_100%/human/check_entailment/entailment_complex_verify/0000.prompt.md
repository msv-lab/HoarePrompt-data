You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `a` from the input. It will then count the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (stored in `cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (stored in `cut0`) in the string `a`. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it will print `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it will print `cut0 + cut1`. The values of `cut0` and `cut1` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The initial binary string `s` and the integer `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` from the input. It then counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (stored in `cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (stored in `cut0`) in the string `a`. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify the initial binary string `s` or the integer `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted and consists of only '0's or only '1's correctly. Specifically, the program will print `1` for any string that does not have a '0' followed by a '1', which is incorrect for strings that are already sorted and consist of only '0's or only '1's. For example, for the input `00000000`, the program will print `1`, which is correct, but for the input `11111111`, it will also print `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output for a string consisting of only '1's should be `1` because it is already sorted and no cuts are needed. The program should print `1` for any string that is already sorted, regardless of whether it contains '0's or '1's.
