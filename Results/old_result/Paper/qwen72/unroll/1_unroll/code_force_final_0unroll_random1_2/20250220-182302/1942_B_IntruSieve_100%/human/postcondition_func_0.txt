The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It processes `arr` to generate a list `mex` of integers, where each element is determined based on the current smallest non-negative integer (`minn`) that has not been used and the value of `arr[i]`. If `arr[i]` is positive, the current `minn` is added to `mex` and marked as used. If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is added to `mex` and marked as used. The function then prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
