You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads from standard input, ignoring the first line, and processes each subsequent line. Each line is expected to contain three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each line, the function updates `b` by adding `c` to it, then prints a value based on the condition `c >= b % 3`. If the condition is true, it prints `a - -b // 3`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each line of input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all lines from the input have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for `sys.stdin` in Python. This is a valid way to read input from standard input.
   - The program skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - For each test case, the program splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Extroverts and Universals**:
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts need.

4. **Tent Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - The expression `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be formed by extroverts and universals.
   - The expression `-b // 3` is used to handle negative division. In Python, `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // 3)`, which ensures that the division is rounded down.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed by adding the number of tents for introverts (`a`) and the number of tents for extroverts and universals (`-b // 3`).

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `c < b % 3`. This condition ensures that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents needed for extroverts.
   - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement, and the program outputs `-1`.
   - Otherwise, the program outputs the calculated number of tents.

### Analysis of the Expression:
- The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the total number of tents. This can be broken down as:
  - `a` is the number of tents needed for introverts.
  - `-b // 3` is the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals, ensuring that the division is rounded down.
  - The total number of tents is the sum of these two values.

- The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents needed for extroverts. If `b % 3` is the remainder when `b` is divided by 3, and `c` is less than this remainder, it means there are not enough universals to form the required tents, and the program outputs `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1**: `a = 1, b = 2, c = 3`
  - `b + c = 5`
  - `b % 3 = 2`
  - `c < b % 3` is `3 < 2` (False), so the program outputs `3` (correct).
- **Case 2**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 1`
  - `b + c = 5`
  - `b % 3 = 1`
  - `c < b % 3` is `1 < 1` (False), but the program should output `-1` because there are not enough universals to form the required tents (incorrect).
- **Case 3**: `a = 1, b = 4, c = 2`
  - `b + c = 6`
  - `b % 3 = 1`
  - `c < b % 3` is `2 < 1` (False), so the program outputs `3` (correct).
- **Case 4**: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 1`
  - `b + c = 2`
  - `b % 3 = 1`
  - `c < b % 3` is `1 < 1` (False), but the program should output `-1` because there are not enough universals to form the required tents (incorrect).
- **Case 5**: `a = 1, b = 3, c = 2`
  - `b + c = 5`
  - `b % 3 = 0`
  - `c < b % 3` is `2 < 0` (False), so the program outputs `3` (correct).
- **Case 6**: `a = 19, b = 7, c = 18`
  - `b + c = 25`
  - `b % 3 = 1`
  - `c < b % 3` is `18 < 1` (False), so the program outputs `28` (correct).
- **Case 7**: `a = 0, b = 0, c = 0`
  - `b + c = 0`
  - `b % 3 = 0`
  - `c < b % 3` is `0 < 0` (False), so the program outputs `0` (correct).
- **Case 8**: `a = 7, b = 0, c = 0`
  - `b + c = 7`
  - `b % 3 = 0`
  - `c < b % 3` is `0 < 0` (False), so the program outputs `7` (correct).
- **Case 9**: `a = 0, b = 24, c = 0`
  - `b + c = 24`
  - `b % 3 = 0`
  - `c < b % 3` is `0 < 0` (False), so the program outputs `8` (correct).
- **Case 10**: `a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000, c = 1000000000`
  - `b + c = 2000000000`
  - `b % 3 = 1`
  - `c < b % 3` is `1000000000 < 1` (False), so the program outputs `1666666667` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle cases where there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement. Specifically, the condition `c < b % 3` should be checked before adding `c` to `b`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
