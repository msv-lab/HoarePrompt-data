Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is not directly used in the program but seems to be a comparison function that could be used for sorting if implemented using a custom sorting mechanism. However, the actual sorting is done using the `sort` method with a lambda function in `func_2`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `n` is set to the length of the input string `s`.
     - `balance_info` is initialized as an empty list to store the balance information for each character.
     - `balance` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current balance.
   - **Balance Calculation**:
     - The program iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to `balance_info` containing the current balance, the position of the character, and the character itself.
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The `balance_info` list is sorted using the `sort` method with a lambda function that sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order (for the same balance).
   - **Result Construction**:
     - The sorted `balance_info` list is used to construct the result string by joining the characters in the order they appear after sorting.
   - **Output**:
     - The result string is printed.

The program correctly follows the steps described in the problem to compute the balanced shuffle of the input string. Therefore, the program is correct.
