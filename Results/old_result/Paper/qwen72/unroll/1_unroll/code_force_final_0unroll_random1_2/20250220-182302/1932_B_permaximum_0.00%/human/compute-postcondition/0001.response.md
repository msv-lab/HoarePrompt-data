The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer value provided by the user and should be within the range 1 to 1000. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
