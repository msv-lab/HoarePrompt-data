Output State: **For each test case, the loop outputs a list `res` of n integers where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar` and updating `mex` accordingly. The final state of `t` is 0, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `a` (or `ar`) are reset for each test case, and their final state is undefined after the last test case.**
