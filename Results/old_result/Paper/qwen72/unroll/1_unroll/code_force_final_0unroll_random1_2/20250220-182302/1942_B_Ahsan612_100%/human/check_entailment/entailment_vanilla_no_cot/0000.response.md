Correctness: **False**

The given solution does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`. The logic for updating the `mex` value and constructing the permutation `p` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than or equal to `mex`. This means that `mex` is being updated in every iteration, which is incorrect.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a set of used numbers and a set of available numbers (those not yet used in the permutation). We can then use the relationship between `a_i` and `p_i` to determine the correct value for `p_i` at each step.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        res = [None] * n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))

func()
```

This corrected version maintains a set of used numbers and correctly updates the `mex` value. It then uses the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to determine `p_i` and ensures that the constructed permutation is valid.
