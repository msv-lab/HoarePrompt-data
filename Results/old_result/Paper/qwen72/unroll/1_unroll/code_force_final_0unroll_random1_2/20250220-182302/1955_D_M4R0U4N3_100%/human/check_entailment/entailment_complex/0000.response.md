Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000 and creates a list `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` to count the occurrences of elements in `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It reads the list `a` of length `n` and the list `b` of length `m`.
   - It updates the `cnt_b` list to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subarray of `a`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`).
   - If an element is in `b_values`, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is still non-negative.
   - It checks if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if true.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new position of the window, it updates the count of the element that is leaving the window and the element that is entering the window.
   - It updates `curr` accordingly and checks if the new `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, incrementing `ans` if true.

5. **Resetting `cnt_b`**:
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for all elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the count of good subarrays for each test case.

**Potential Issues**:
- The function correctly initializes and resets `cnt_b` for each test case.
- The sliding window approach is correctly implemented to efficiently count the number of matching elements in each subarray of length `m`.
- The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
