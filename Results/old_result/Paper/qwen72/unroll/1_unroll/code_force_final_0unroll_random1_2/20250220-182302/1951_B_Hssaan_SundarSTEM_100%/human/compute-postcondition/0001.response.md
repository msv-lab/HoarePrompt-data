Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum number of cows that can be in front of your cow (index k-1) without having a higher Cowdeforces rating than your cow. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` are processed and their values are used to compute the result, but they are not retained between test cases. The final output state is the sequence of printed results for each test case.**
