### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function checks if any element in the array `a` is negative before starting the operations. If it finds a negative element, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, setting `stop` to `True`.

3. **Operation Application:**
   - The function iterates over the array from the first element to the second-to-last element (excluding the last two elements).
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the number of operations `opNum` that can be performed using `a[i]` as the pivot.
   - It then applies the operation by subtracting `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After applying the operations, the function checks if the last two elements of the array are zero.
   - If either of the last two elements is not zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - If both are zero, it prints 'YES'.

### Analysis:

- **Negative Elements:**
  - The initial check for negative elements is correct because the operation can only decrease the elements, and starting with a negative element would make it impossible to achieve the desired state.

- **Operation Application:**
  - The operation is applied correctly by subtracting `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`.
  - This ensures that the elements are being reduced in a way that is consistent with the problem's operation rules.

- **Final Check:**
  - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is a necessary condition for the entire array to be zero.
  - However, the function does not check if any intermediate elements become negative during the operation application, which could lead to an incorrect result.

### Potential Issues:

- **Intermediate Negative Elements:**
  - The function does not check if any element becomes negative during the operation application. This is a critical oversight because if any element becomes negative, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations.

### Correctness:

- **False:**
  - The function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where intermediate elements become negative during the operation application. This can lead to incorrect results, especially in cases where the array elements are not initially zero but can become negative after applying the operations.

### Example of Failure:

Consider the array `[1, 2, 1]`:
- After the first operation at `i=1`, the array becomes `[0, 0, -1]`.
- The function will not detect this negative element and will continue to the final check, which will incorrectly print 'YES' because the last two elements are zero.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**
