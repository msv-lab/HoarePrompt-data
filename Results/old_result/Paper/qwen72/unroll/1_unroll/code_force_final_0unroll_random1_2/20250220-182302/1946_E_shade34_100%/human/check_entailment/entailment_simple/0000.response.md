### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The program starts by calculating the factorials of numbers up to 200,000 and storing them in the list `facts`. This is done using a loop where `ch` is multiplied by `i` and the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow. This is a correct and efficient way to precompute factorials.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, followed by the lists `p` and `s` which contain the indices of prefix and suffix maximums, respectively.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   - The program checks if the last index of prefix maximums `p[-1]` is equal to the first index of suffix maximums `s[0]`, and if the first index of prefix maximums `p[0]` is 1 and the last index of suffix maximums `s[-1]` is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, which is correct because these conditions must hold for a valid permutation.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses a function `func_2` to calculate combinations. The function `func_2` is designed to compute the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then use it to calculate the combination \( \binom{a}{b} \). However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_2`:
     - The function `func_1` is intended to compute the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the modular inverse, but it is not correctly implemented for this purpose. The function `func_1` should return the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but it does not handle the case where `b` is not coprime with \(10^9 + 7\). Since \(10^9 + 7\) is a prime number, every integer less than \(10^9 + 7\) is coprime with it, so the function should work. However, the function `func_1` is not correctly structured to return the modular inverse.

5. **Combination Calculation in the Main Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums `s` and calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums. It then iterates over the prefix maximums `p` in reverse order (excluding the last element) and calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the prefix maximums. This is done using the combination function `func_2`.

6. **Final Multiplication**:
   - The program multiplies the results of the combination calculations with the factorials of the differences between consecutive elements in `p` and `s` to account for the permutations of the elements between the maximums. This is a correct approach to count the number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the implementation of the function `func_1`, which is supposed to compute the modular inverse. The function `func_1` is not correctly structured to return the modular inverse, which is crucial for the combination calculation in `func_2`. This error will lead to incorrect results for the combination calculations.

**Correctness: **False****

The program needs to be corrected to properly compute the modular inverse in `func_1` to ensure the combination calculations are accurate.
