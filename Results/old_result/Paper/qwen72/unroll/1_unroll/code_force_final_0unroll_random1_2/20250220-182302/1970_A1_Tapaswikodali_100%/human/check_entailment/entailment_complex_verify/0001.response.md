### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires computing the "balanced shuffle" of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves:
     - Calculating the balance of each prefix.
     - Sorting the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order.
     - For characters with the same prefix balance, sorting them in decreasing order of their positions.
   - The final sequence is formed by the characters in the sorted order.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - **Function 1** (`func_1`):
     - This function is not used in the provided program. It seems to be a comparison function, but it is not called anywhere. Therefore, it does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - **Function 2** (`func_2`):
     - **Step 1**: Initialize the length of the string `n` and an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information.
     - **Step 2**: Compute the balance of each prefix and store the balance, position, and character in a `BalanceInfo` object.
     - **Step 3**: Sort the `balance_info` list using a lambda function that sorts by balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order.
     - **Step 4**: Join the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list to form the result string and print it.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - **Balance Calculation**:
     - The balance is correctly updated as we iterate through the string. For each opening parenthesis '(', the balance is incremented, and for each closing parenthesis ')', the balance is decremented.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The sorting is done using a lambda function that first sorts by balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order. This matches the problem description.
   - **Result Construction**:
     - The result string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list, which is the correct approach.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000) correctly.
   - The program should work for any valid balanced parentheses sequence, including edge cases like a single pair of parentheses "()".

5. **Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations confirm that the `balance_info` list is correctly populated with `BalanceInfo` objects containing the balance, position, and character.
   - The annotations also confirm that the sorting is done correctly based on the balance and position.
   - The final result is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.
- There are no logical errors or issues with the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
