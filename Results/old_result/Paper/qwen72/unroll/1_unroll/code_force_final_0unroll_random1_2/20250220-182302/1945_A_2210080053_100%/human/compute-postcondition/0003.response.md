Functionality: ** The function reads from standard input, ignoring the first line, and processes each subsequent line. Each line is expected to contain three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. For each line, the function updates `b` by adding `c` to it, then prints a value based on the condition `c >= b % 3`. If the condition is true, it prints `a - -b // 3`; otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each line of input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all lines from the input have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. **
