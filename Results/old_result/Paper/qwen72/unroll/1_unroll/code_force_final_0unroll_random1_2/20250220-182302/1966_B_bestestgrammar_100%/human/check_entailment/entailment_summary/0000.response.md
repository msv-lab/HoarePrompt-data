### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Corner Case Check**:
   - The function checks if the top-left corner `gr[0][0]` and the bottom-right corner `gr[n-1][m-1]` of the grid are the same color.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to further checks.

3. **Further Checks**:
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, the function checks if any row or column has all the same characters.
   - If any row or column has all the same characters, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - If no row or column has all the same characters, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the value of `ans`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Top-Left and Bottom-Right Corners**:
  - If the top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting these two corners and performing the operation.
  - If they are different, the function needs to determine if it is still possible to make the entire grid the same color.

- **Row and Column Checks**:
  - If any row or column has all the same characters, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations. This is because any operation that changes the color of a subrectangle will not affect the uniformity of a row or column that is already uniform.
  - If no row or column has all the same characters, it is possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate pairs of squares.

### Issues in the Logic:

- **Incorrect Row and Column Checks**:
  - The function incorrectly sets `ans` to 'NO' if any row or column has all the same characters. This is a logical error because the presence of a uniform row or column does not necessarily mean that the entire grid cannot be made uniform.
  - The correct approach should be to check if the grid can be made uniform by ensuring that there are no rows or columns that are entirely one color and that the top-left and bottom-right corners are different.

### Corrected Logic:

- **Top-Left and Bottom-Right Corners**:
  - If `gr[0][0]` and `gr[n-1][m-1]` are the same, print 'YES'.
  - If they are different, check if there is any row or column that is entirely one color.
  - If there is any such row or column, print 'NO'.
  - Otherwise, print 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has a logical error in the row and column checks, which can lead to incorrect outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
