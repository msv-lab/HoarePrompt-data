Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `xx` will be a list containing `n + 1` elements, where the first element is an empty string and the next `n` elements are the `n` input strings. The lists `a` and `b` will each have `n + 1` elements, where each element at index `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n) will represent the count of 'F' and 'S' characters, respectively, in the i-th row and the i-th column of the input matrix. The initial state of `a` and `b` being all zeros will be updated accordingly. `sa` is an empty list.**
