The code snippet `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum` with updated arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. This function call will affect the state of the program, particularly the variables `l` and `r` within the context of the function call. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is expected to perform some operations on the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and possibly update the list `ops` with new operations.

However, since the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is not defined in the given code snippet, we can only infer the changes based on the provided initial state and the function call itself.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`, and `pos` is not equal to `r`. The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with arguments `l` = `pos + 1` and `r` = `r`.**
