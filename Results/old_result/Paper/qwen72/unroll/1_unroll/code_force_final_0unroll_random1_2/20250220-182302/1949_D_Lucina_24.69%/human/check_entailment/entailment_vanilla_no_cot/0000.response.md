Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided does not guarantee that the transition videos will not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of the scenarios. The logic in the program is flawed in the following ways:

1. **Incorrect Assignment of 'F' and 'S' to Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program assigns 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions based on whether the scenario is in the first quarter of the list of scenarios with only 'F' or 'S' transitions. This approach does not ensure that the sequence of transitions will meet the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Handling of Scenarios with Both 'F' and 'S':**
   - The program does not handle scenarios that have both 'F' and 'S' transitions correctly. It only considers scenarios with either 'F' or 'S' transitions, but not both, which can lead to an incorrect distribution of 'F' and 'S' transitions.

3. **Permutation Validation:**
   - The program does not validate the resulting transition plan against all possible permutations of the scenarios to ensure that the requirement is met. This is a crucial step that is missing.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure that the transition videos meet the requirement, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible method is to use a backtracking algorithm to try different assignments of 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions and check if the resulting plan satisfies the condition for all permutations of the scenarios. This is a more complex problem and requires a deeper understanding of combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a more robust approach that uses backtracking to ensure the requirement is met:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def is_valid(arr, n):
    max_consecutive = (3 * n) // 4
    for perm in permutations(range(n)):
        consecutive_count = 1
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if arr[perm[i]][perm[i + 1]] == arr[perm[i - 1]][perm[i]]:
                consecutive_count += 1
                if consecutive_count > max_consecutive:
                    return False
            else:
                consecutive_count = 1
    return True

def backtrack(arr, n, i, j, max_consecutive):
    if i == n:
        return is_valid(arr, n)
    if j == n:
        return backtrack(arr, n, i + 1, i + 2, max_consecutive)
    if arr[i][j] == '?':
        for video in ['F', 'S']:
            arr[i][j] = video
            arr[j][i] = video
            if backtrack(arr, n, i, j + 1, max_consecutive):
                return True
            arr[i][j] = '?'
            arr[j][i] = '?'
    else:
        return backtrack(arr, n, i, j + 1, max_consecutive)
    return False

def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    max_consecutive = (3 * n) // 4
    
    if backtrack(arr, n, 0, 1, max_consecutive):
        for row in arr:
            print(''.join(row))
    else:
        print("No valid solution found")

func()
```

This solution uses backtracking to try all possible assignments of 'F' and 'S' to the undecided transitions and checks if the resulting plan is valid for all permutations of the scenarios. If a valid plan is found, it prints the plan; otherwise, it indicates that no valid solution was found. This approach is more likely to meet the problem's requirements.
