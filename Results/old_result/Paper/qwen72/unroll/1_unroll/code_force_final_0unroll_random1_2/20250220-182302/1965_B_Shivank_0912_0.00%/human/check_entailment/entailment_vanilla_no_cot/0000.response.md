Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not satisfy the problem's conditions. Specifically, the solution generates a fixed sequence of powers of 2, which is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...]` up to 25 elements. This sequence does not take into account the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case, and it will not always meet the requirements of the problem.

For example:
- In the case where `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` will include the number 2, which means there is a subsequence that sums to 2, violating the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.
- In the case where `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` will include the number 1, which means there is a subsequence that sums to 1, violating the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.

The solution needs to be more dynamic and consider the specific values of `n` and `k` to generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements.
