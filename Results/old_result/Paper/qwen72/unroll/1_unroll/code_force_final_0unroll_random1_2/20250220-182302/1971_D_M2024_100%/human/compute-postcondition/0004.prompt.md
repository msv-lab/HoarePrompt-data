You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `a` from the input. It will then count the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (stored in `cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (stored in `cut0`) in the string `a`. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it will print `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it will print `cut0 + cut1`. The values of `cut0` and `cut1` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. The initial binary string `s` and the integer `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a binary string `s` and returns the count of '1's in the string.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
