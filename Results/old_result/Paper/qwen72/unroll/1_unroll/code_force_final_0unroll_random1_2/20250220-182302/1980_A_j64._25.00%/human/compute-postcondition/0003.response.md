Output State: **The `results` list is populated with `t` integers, each representing the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`. The `freq` list is reset to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` for each iteration, and `missing` is calculated based on the frequency of characters in the string `a` for each test case. The initial state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
