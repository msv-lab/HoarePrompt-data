### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to carefully analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem description. The problem involves counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices for prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and the result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Given \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), where \( n \) is the length of the permutation, \( m_1 \) is the number of prefix maximums, and \( m_2 \) is the number of suffix maximums.
   - We are also given the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The goal is to count the number of permutations that satisfy these conditions.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function appears to be an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( c \) and \( d \) such that \( a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b) \).
     - It is used to find the modular inverse in `func_2`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function computes the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - It uses `func_1` to find the coefficients and then returns the modular inverse.

3. **Algorithm for Counting Permutations:**
   - The key insight is that the prefix maximums and suffix maximums must be placed in specific positions in the permutation.
   - The prefix maximums must be in increasing order, and the suffix maximums must be in decreasing order.
   - The intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums must be the same element (the maximum of the permutation).

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - **Preprocessing Factorials:**
     - The program precomputes factorials modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and stores them in the `facts` list. This is a common technique for efficient computation of combinations.
     - `facts[i]` contains \( i! \mod 10^9 + 7 \).

   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), followed by the indices of the prefix maximums \( p \) and suffix maximums \( s \).

   - **Initial Validation:**
     - The program checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, which is correct because the permutation cannot satisfy the given conditions.

   - **Counting Permutations:**
     - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to \( n \).
     - It iterates over the suffix maximums \( s \) and calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements using combinations and modular inverses.
     - It then processes the prefix maximums \( p \) in reverse order, again calculating the number of ways to place the remaining elements.
     - Finally, it multiplies the number of ways to place the elements between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The use of precomputed factorials and modular inverses ensures efficient computation.
   - The initial validation and the subsequent calculations are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it implements the necessary logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used appropriately to compute modular inverses, and the overall algorithm aligns with the problem requirements.
