### Reasoning:

1. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range of Manhattan values for a permutation of length `n`.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated correctly:
     - For odd `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\).
     - For even `n`, the maximum Manhattan value is \(n^2 // 2\).
   - If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function returns `(0, 0)`, which correctly indicates that no valid permutation exists.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function starts with a list `l` that is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then attempts to modify this list to achieve the desired Manhattan value by moving elements.
   - The key logic is to move the last element to a position that reduces `k` by a certain amount. This is done in a loop that iterates from `n-1` down to 0.
   - The loop terminates when `k` becomes 0 or when the condition `1 + i > k` is met.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` is 0 by returning the initial permutation.
   - However, the logic for moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value is flawed. Specifically, the condition `1 + i > k` and the subsequent insertion of the last element at position `-k` does not always produce a valid permutation with the correct Manhattan value.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 4` and `k = 6`, the correct output should be a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 6, such as `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - Let's trace the function `func_1` with `n = 4` and `k = 6`:
     - `k` is divided by 2, so `k = 3`.
     - The initial list `l` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - The loop starts with `i = 3`:
       - `1 + i = 4`, which is not greater than `k = 3`.
       - `k` is updated to `k - 3 + 1 = 1`.
       - The last element `4` is moved to the beginning of the list, resulting in `l = [4, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - The loop continues with `i = 2`:
       - `1 + i = 3`, which is not greater than `k = 1`.
       - `k` is updated to `k - 2 + 1 = 0`.
       - The last element `3` is moved to the beginning of the list, resulting in `l = [3, 4, 1, 2]`.
     - The loop terminates because `k` is now 0.
   - The final list `l = [3, 4, 1, 2]` does not have a Manhattan value of 6. The Manhattan value is \(|3-1| + |4-2| + |1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\).

4. **Flaw in `func_1`**:
   - The logic for moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value is incorrect. The function should ensure that the Manhattan value is exactly `k` by carefully selecting the positions to swap elements.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee that the final permutation will have the correct Manhattan value.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not always generate a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value, as demonstrated by the example `n = 4` and `k = 6`.

Final: **False**
