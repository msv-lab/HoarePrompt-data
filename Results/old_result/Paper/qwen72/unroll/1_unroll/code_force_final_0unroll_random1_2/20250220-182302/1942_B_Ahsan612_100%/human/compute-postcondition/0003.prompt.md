You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs a list `res` of n integers where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar` and updating `mex` accordingly. The final state of `t` is 0, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `a` (or `ar`) are reset for each test case, and their final state is undefined after the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). For each test case, it returns a result based on the input list `a` and the integer `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
