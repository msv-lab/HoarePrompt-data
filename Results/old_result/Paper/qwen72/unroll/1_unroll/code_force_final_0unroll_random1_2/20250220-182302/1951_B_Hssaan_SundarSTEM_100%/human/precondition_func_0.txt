The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of cows and your cow's index, and a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and all a_i's are pairwise different.
