The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. The loop will execute if `N` is greater than 1, and `i` starts at 1. Given the initial state, `N` is 200001, which is greater than 1, so the loop condition is already satisfied. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be set to 1, which is the initial value for the range function in the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1**
