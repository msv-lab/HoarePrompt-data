Functionality: ** The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, the function returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `b` and `a % b`, and returns a tuple (y, x - a // b * y, g), where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by the recursive call. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned these three values, which are related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity. **
