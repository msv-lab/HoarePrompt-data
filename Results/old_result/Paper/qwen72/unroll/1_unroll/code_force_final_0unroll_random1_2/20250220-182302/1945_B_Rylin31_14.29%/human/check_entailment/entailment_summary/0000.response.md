### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously in the sky. Given the frequencies `a` and `b` at which the two installations launch fireworks, and the visibility duration `m + 1` minutes, we need to calculate the maximum overlap of fireworks.

The provided program calculates a value `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. This value represents the time at which the first firework from the slower installation (the one with the higher frequency) will be visible, plus the visibility duration `m`.

The program then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If this condition is met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

However, this logic is flawed. The condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` does not correctly capture the scenario where the fireworks from both installations can overlap. Instead, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the first time both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time should be based on the LCM and the visibility duration `m`.

### Correct Solution:

1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window `m + 1`.
3. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window, plus one if the LCM is within the visibility window.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b
        if l <= m + 1:
            max_visible += 1
        print(max_visible)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD) function from the `math` module.
2. **Visibility Window Calculation**: The number of fireworks visible at any time is calculated as `(m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b`, which counts the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility window.
3. **Overlap Check**: If the LCM of `a` and `b` is within the visibility window (`l <= m + 1`), it means that at some point, both installations will launch fireworks simultaneously, so we add 1 to the total count.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the overlap of fireworks based on the LCM of `a` and `b`. The corrected program correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

Correctness: **False**
