The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of positive integers `n` and `m` and calculates a value `ans` based on a specific algorithm. The function then prints the value of `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the printed results for each test case, with the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remaining unchanged.
