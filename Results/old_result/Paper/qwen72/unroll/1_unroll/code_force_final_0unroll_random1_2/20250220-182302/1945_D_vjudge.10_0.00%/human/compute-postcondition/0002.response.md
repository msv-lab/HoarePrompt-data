To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop index and will start at 0 by default.
2. **Variable `x`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `x` must be greater than 0.

The other variables and lists (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `custos`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5, `x` must be greater than 0, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
