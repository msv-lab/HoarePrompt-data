### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \), it means we need to color cells such that every diagonal has at least one colored cell. This is a special case because it requires a different approach.
   - In this case, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( n \) (one cell per row or column), but since \( k \) is \( 4n - 2 \), we need to color \( n + 1 \) cells to ensure all diagonals are covered. This is because the last cell in the row or column will cover the last diagonal.

3. **General Case Handling:**
   - For \( k < 4n - 2 \), we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - Each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).
   - Therefore, the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). If true, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

5. **Verification:**
   - The special case \( k = 4n - 2 \) is correctly handled by printing \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - The general case \( k < 4n - 2 \) is correctly handled by printing \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where \( k \) is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles the maximum value of \( k \) (i.e., \( 4n - 2 \)) correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells to be colored for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
