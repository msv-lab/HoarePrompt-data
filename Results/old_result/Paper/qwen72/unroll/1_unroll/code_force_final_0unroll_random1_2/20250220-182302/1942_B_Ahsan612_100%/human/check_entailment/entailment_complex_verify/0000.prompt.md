You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data.

        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs a list `res` of n integers where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar` and updating `mex` accordingly. The final state of `t` is 0, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `a` (or `ar`) are reset for each test case, and their final state is undefined after the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then computes a new list `res` of `n` integers where each element is calculated as `mex - ar[i]` starting from the end of the list `ar`, and updates `mex` accordingly. The function prints the resulting list `res` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of `t`, `n`, and `ar` is undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the MEX value needs to be updated correctly when encountering negative values in the array `ar`. Specifically, the logic `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is flawed because it does not ensure that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not present in the permutation constructed so far. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 1 -4 0
```
The expected output is a permutation `p` such that `a` is `[1, 1, 1, -4, 0]`. However, the program will produce an incorrect result because it does not correctly handle the negative value `-4` in the array `ar`.

Let's break down the execution:
- For `i = 4`, `ar[4] = 0`, `mex = 5`, so `res[4] = 5 - 0 = 5`. This is incorrect because `5` is not a valid value in the permutation.
- For `i = 3`, `ar[3] = -4`, `mex = 5`, so `res[3] = 5 - (-4) = 9`. This is also incorrect because `9` is not a valid value in the permutation.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input, and the correctness is **False**.
