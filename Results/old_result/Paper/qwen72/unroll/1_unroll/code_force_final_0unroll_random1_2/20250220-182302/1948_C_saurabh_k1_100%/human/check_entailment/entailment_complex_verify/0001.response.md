### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps: a voluntary move and a forced move along the arrow.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (<) or right (>).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the number of columns (n) and the arrows in the first and second rows (a and b).
   - The output should be "YES" if the robot can reach (2, n) and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot must move to the right to reach the end of the grid.
   - If the robot is in the first row and encounters a '<' arrow, it will move left.
   - If the robot is in the second row and encounters a '<' arrow, it will move left.
   - The robot can only move to the second row if it is in the first row and the arrow in the first row points down (which is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the problem constraints).

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (t) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns (n) and the arrows in the first and second rows (a and b).
   - The program then checks for a specific condition using a loop that iterates over the odd indices (i) of the first row (a).

5. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is checking if there is a '<' arrow in the first row (a) at an odd index (i) and a '<' arrow in the second row (b) at the next even index (i + 1) or the previous even index (i - 1).
   - If this condition is met, the robot will be forced to move left and will not be able to reach the end of the grid (2, n). Therefore, the program prints "No" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a condition, the program prints "yes".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where n is even.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the robot can move to the second row and then to the end of the grid.
   - The program correctly identifies when the robot is forced to move left and cannot reach the end.

7. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program uses `print('No')` and `print('yes')` which should be consistent with the problem's requirement to print "YES" or "NO" in any case. However, the lowercase 'no' and 'yes' might be a minor issue in terms of formatting, but it should still be recognized as correct by the problem's constraints.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The loop iterates over odd indices (i) of the first row (a).
- The condition `if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is designed to detect if the robot will be forced to move left in such a way that it cannot reach the end of the grid.
- The loop correctly checks for the presence of '<' arrows in the first row and the corresponding positions in the second row.
- The `else` block is executed if the loop completes without breaking, indicating that no such condition was found, and the robot can reach the end.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program's logic is correct and it correctly identifies when the robot cannot reach the end of the grid.
- The only minor issue is the output format, but this should not affect the correctness of the solution as the problem states that "yes" and "no" in any case will be recognized.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
