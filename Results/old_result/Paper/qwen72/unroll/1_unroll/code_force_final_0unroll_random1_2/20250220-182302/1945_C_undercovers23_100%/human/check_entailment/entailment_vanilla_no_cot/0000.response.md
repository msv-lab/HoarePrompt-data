Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `pk`:**
   - The program calculates `pk` as `n / 2` regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. This is incorrect because for odd `n`, `pk` should be `n // 2 + 1` (i.e., the ceiling of `n / 2`).

2. **Incorrect Percentage Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` as percentages, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The problem requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, not if the percentage is 50% or more.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge cases where the road should be laid before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`). It only appends valid positions to `lst` and then tries to find the minimum distance, but it does not handle the edge cases properly.

4. **Final Position Selection:**
   - The program's logic for selecting the final position is flawed. It should directly check the conditions for `i = 0` and `i = n` and include them in the list of valid positions if they satisfy the conditions.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            pk = n // 2
        else:
            pk = n // 2 + 1
        
        zero = 0
        one = s.count('1')
        lst = []
        
        # Check for i = 0
        if one >= (n - 0 + 1) // 2:
            lst.append(0)
        
        # Check for 1 <= i < n
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[i-1] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one -= 1
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and one >= (n - i) // 2:
                lst.append(i)
        
        # Check for i = n
        if zero >= (n + 1) // 2:
            lst.append(n)
        
        # Find the position closest to the middle
        lst.sort(key=lambda x: abs(pk - x))
        print(lst[0])

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Calculate `pk` Correctly:**
   - `pk` is calculated as `n // 2 + 1` for odd `n` and `n // 2` for even `n`.

2. **Check Edge Cases:**
   - The program checks if laying the road before the first house (`i = 0`) or after the last house (`i = n`) satisfies the conditions and includes these positions in the list of valid positions if they do.

3. **Check for 1 <= i < n:**
   - The program iterates through each possible position `i` from 1 to `n-1` and updates the counts of `zero` and `one` accordingly. It then checks if the conditions are satisfied and appends valid positions to `lst`.

4. **Select the Closest Position:**
   - The program sorts the list of valid positions by their distance to `pk` and prints the first element, which is the position closest to the middle of the village.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
