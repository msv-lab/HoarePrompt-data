### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program initializes a global `cnt_b` list with a length of `max_val + 1` (1,000,001) to track the frequency of elements in array `b`. This is appropriate given the constraints.
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Count for Array `b`**:
   - The program correctly increments the count of each element in `b` in the `cnt_b` list. This helps in quickly checking how many elements in a subarray of `a` match the elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - The program initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of elements in the current subarray of `a` that can be matched with elements in `b`.
   - It checks the first subarray of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in this subarray, if it is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check all subarrays of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new element added to the window (i.e., `a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - For each element removed from the window (i.e., `a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` after each slide, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts**:
   - After processing each test case, the program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Subarray Check**:
  - The program correctly initializes `curr` to 0 and checks the first subarray of length `m` in `a`.
  - It decrements the count in `cnt_b` for each element in the subarray and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
  - This ensures that `curr` accurately reflects the number of matching elements in the initial subarray.

- **Sliding Window**:
  - The sliding window approach is efficient and correctly updates `curr` and `ans` for each new subarray.
  - When an element is added to the window, the program decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
  - When an element is removed from the window, the program increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
  - This ensures that `curr` is always up-to-date with the number of matching elements in the current subarray.

- **Resetting Counts**:
  - The program correctly resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 after processing each test case.
  - This is necessary to ensure that the counts are accurate for the next test case.

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description. The logic and implementation align with the requirements and constraints of the problem.
