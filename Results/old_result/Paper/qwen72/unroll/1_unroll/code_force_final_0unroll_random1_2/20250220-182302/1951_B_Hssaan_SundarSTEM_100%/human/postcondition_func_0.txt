The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k-1`, along with a list of Cowdeforces ratings `s` for the cows. It calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be in front of your cow without any of them having a higher rating than your cow. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is the sequence of printed results, one for each test case.
