You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero by performing a specific operation any number of times.
   - The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and subtracting `1` from `a[i-1]`, `2` from `a[i]`, and `1` from `a[i+1]`.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It then checks if it's possible to make all elements of `a` zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates through the array and applies the operation to each element `a[i]` (for `i` from `0` to `n-3`).
   - It calculates the number of operations `opNum` needed to make `a[i]` zero and applies the operation to `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]`.
   - If at any point `a[i]` is negative, it immediately prints "NO" and moves to the next test case.
   - After processing all elements up to `n-3`, it checks if the last two elements `a[n-2]` and `a[n-1]` are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The program correctly handles the condition where `a[i]` becomes negative, which is a valid stopping point because it indicates that the operation cannot be applied without making the array invalid.
   - The program also correctly checks the last two elements of the array to ensure they are zero, which is necessary because the operation can only affect elements up to `a[n-3]`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not check if the sum of the array elements is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be zeroed out. This is because each operation subtracts a total of 4 from the array.
   - The program does not handle the case where the last two elements are not zero but the rest of the array is zero, which could lead to incorrect results.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the total sum of the array elements. If the sum is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to zero out the array.
   - Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the last two elements are not zero but the rest of the array is zero, which could lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the total sum of the array elements and does not handle the case where the last two elements are not zero but the rest of the array is zero.

Correctness: **False**
