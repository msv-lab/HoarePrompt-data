### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, placing a black rook at the mirrored position (c, r) unless r = c, in which case it skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns) that are not yet occupied by rooks.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board where no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one configuration (one rook).
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations (one rook in each cell of a 2x2 board, or two rooks in non-attacking positions).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`:
       - `dp[i - 1]`: Placing one rook in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.
       - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`: Placing two rooks in non-attacking positions in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \) are read.
   - The \( k \) moves are read, and the row and column indices are added to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied.
   - The number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) rows (or columns) is given by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0, there are no valid moves left, and the number of configurations is 1 (the current state).
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 1, there is only one valid configuration (one rook).

5. **Precomputation**:
   - The `func_1` function precomputes the DP values up to 300,000, which is sufficient given the constraints.
   - This ensures that the DP values are available for any test case within the given limits.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, which is a common practice in competitive programming.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5 \).
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem constraints.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly initializes `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` with the base cases.
  - The loop correctly computes the DP values using the recurrence relation.
  - The final state of the program is that `dp[n]` holds the computed value, which is the result of the recurrence relation modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

- **Handling Test Cases**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
  - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to the set `invalid`.
  - The program correctly prints `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` to handle the edge case where no valid moves are left.

### Final Evaluation:

- The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
- It handles the input and output as specified.
- The logic for precomputing the DP values and calculating the final configurations is sound.
- The edge cases are correctly handled, and the modulo operation ensures that the results are within the required range.

Final: **True**
