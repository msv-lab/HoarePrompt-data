Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This ensures that the input string is clean and ready for processing.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: The program initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`. It also initializes a variable `balance` to 0. The program then iterates over the string `s` and for each character:
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, i, s[i])` to `prefix_balance`.
   - It updates the `balance` by incrementing it if the character is '(', and decrementing it if the character is ')'.
   This correctly calculates the prefix balance for each character in the sequence. The `prefix_balance` list will contain tuples where the first element is the balance, the second element is the position, and the third element is the character.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `prefix_balance` list using a custom key. The key is a tuple `(x[0], -x[1])`, which means:
   - The list is first sorted by the prefix balance in ascending order.
   - If two characters have the same prefix balance, they are sorted by their position in descending order.
   This sorting step is crucial and correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. The descending order of positions ensures that the characters with the same balance are ordered from right to left, which is required by the problem.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list. This is done using a list comprehension to extract the characters from the sorted tuples and then joining them into a single string. The list comprehension `[x[2] for x in prefix_balance]` correctly extracts the characters in the new order, and `join` combines them into a single string.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)`, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string. This matches the expected output format.

The program follows the steps outlined in the problem description accurately and handles the input and output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
