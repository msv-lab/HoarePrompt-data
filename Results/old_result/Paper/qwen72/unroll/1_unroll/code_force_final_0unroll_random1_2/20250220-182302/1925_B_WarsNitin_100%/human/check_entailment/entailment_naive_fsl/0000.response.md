Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `1` correctly. When `n` is `1`, the only way to break up the problem is to have a single sub-problem with difficulty `x`, and the GCD of a single number is the number itself. However, the program does not account for this special case and may return an incorrect value.

For example, with the input:
```
1
10 1
```
The expected output is `10` because the only sub-problem has a difficulty of `10`, and the GCD of `10` is `10`. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect.
