### Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, leading to the apocalypse. Let's break down the logic and see if it matches the requirements of the problem.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and a list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Year Calculation:**
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the function updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - `year % ai` calculates the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is 0 (i.e., `year` is a multiple of `ai`), the expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is non-zero, the expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai`.

4. **Update Mechanism:**
   - If `year` is a multiple of `ai`, the function adds `ai` to `year`.
   - If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the function adds the smallest non-zero remainder of `year` when divided by `ai` to `year`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `year` for each test case.

### Verification:

Let's verify the function with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Initial `year = 0`
  - For `ai = 3`: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`
  - For `ai = 2`: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 2 = 1`)
  - For `ai = 4`: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since `4 % 4 = 0`)
  - For `ai = 5`: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since `8 % 5 = 3`)
  - For `ai = 9`: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since `10 % 9 = 1`)
  - For `ai = 18`: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since `18 % 18 = 0`)
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial `year = 0`
  - For `ai = 1`: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - For `ai = 2`: `year = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `1 % 2 = 1`)
  - For `ai = 3`: `year = 2 + 1 = 3` (since `2 % 3 = 2`)
  - For `ai = 4`: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 4 = 3`)
  - For `ai = 5`: `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `4 % 5 = 4`)
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Initial `year = 0`
  - For `ai = 1`: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`
  - For `ai = 1`: `year = 1 + 1 = 2`
  - For `ai = 1`: `year = 2 + 1 = 3`
  - For `ai = 1`: `year = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - For `ai = 1`: `year = 4 + 1 = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Initial `year = 0`
  - For `ai = 50`: `year = 0 + 50 = 50`
  - For `ai = 30`: `year = 50 + 10 = 60` (since `50 % 30 = 20`)
  - For `ai = 711`: `year = 60 + 651 = 711` (since `60 % 711 = 60`)
  - For `ai = 200`: `year = 711 + 189 = 900` (since `711 % 200 = 111`)
  - For `ai = 503`: `year = 900 + 103 = 1003` (since `900 % 503 = 397`)
  - For `ai = 1006`: `year = 1003 + 2 = 1005` (since `1003 % 1006 = 1003`)
  - Output: `2012` (This is incorrect based on the problem statement, the correct output should be `2012` as the 6th sign occurs in the 2012th year)

### Conclusion:

The function logic is correct for the first three test cases, but it fails for the fourth test case. The issue lies in the update mechanism for `year`. The function should ensure that the signs occur sequentially, and the correct year should be the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, adjusted for the sequential occurrence.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. The correct approach would involve calculating the LCM of the periodicities and adjusting for the sequential requirement.
