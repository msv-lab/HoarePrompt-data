Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the minimum travel costs for each city, and the results of the queries are printed.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it represents the number of test cases.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged for each test case as it represents the number of cities.
- The list `a` remains unchanged as it represents the coordinates of the cities.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged for each test case as it represents the number of queries.
- The list `queries` remains unchanged as it represents the pairs of cities for which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated.
- The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the minimum travel costs for each city based on the loop calculations.
- The results of the queries are printed, but the variables themselves are not modified by the loop.
