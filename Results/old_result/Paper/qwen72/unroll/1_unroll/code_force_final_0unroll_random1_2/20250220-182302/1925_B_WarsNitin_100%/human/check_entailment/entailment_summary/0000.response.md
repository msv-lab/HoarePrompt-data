### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.
   - The goal is to maximize this GCD.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` processes each test case by reading `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - It iterates over all divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty that is a multiple of `i` and if the sum of these difficulties equals `x`.
   - If the conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks the corresponding divisor `x // i` to ensure it is considered.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - The condition `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensures that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - The condition `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` ensures that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with a difficulty that is a multiple of `x // i`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `x = 1` and `n = 1`, the only possible GCD is 1, which is correctly handled.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only possible way to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of 1, which is correctly handled.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The function only iterates up to the square root of `x` to find divisors, which is efficient and ensures that all divisors are considered.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the possible sub-problems are `[4, 2, 4]` with GCD 2, which is the maximum possible GCD.
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only possible sub-problems are `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with GCD 1.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the possible sub-problems can be `[6, 6, 6, ..., 6]` (69 times) with GCD 6.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD of the sub-problems for each test case. The conditions and the loop structure are appropriate for the problem, and the edge cases are handled correctly.

**Correctness: True**
