You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, x and y, where x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on user input for each iteration of the loop, and `z` is calculated and printed for each iteration. The value of `a` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `a` from user input, and for each of the `a` iterations, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from user input. For each iteration, it calculates a value `z` based on `x` and `y`, and prints `z`. The values of `x` and `y` are updated with each iteration, and the value of `a` remains unchanged throughout the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the variable `a` is used in the condition `if m < a:` which should be `if m < x:` instead. This mistake can lead to incorrect calculations and outputs. 

Here is a test case where the program fails:
- Input: 
  ```
  1
  12 4
  ```
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output: 
  ```
  3
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required because it uses the number of test cases `a` instead of the number of 1x1 icons `x` in the condition `if m < a:`. This leads to an incorrect result.
