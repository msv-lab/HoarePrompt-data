The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input integer `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. Before the loop starts, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, and `_` will start at 0 (the first iteration of the loop).

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged, `results` is an empty list**
