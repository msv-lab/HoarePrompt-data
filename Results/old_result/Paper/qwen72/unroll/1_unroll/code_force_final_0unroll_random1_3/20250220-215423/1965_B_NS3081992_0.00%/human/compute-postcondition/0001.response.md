To determine the output state after the loop executes, we need to understand the behavior of the functions `func_10()` and `func_14()` and how they interact with the loop.

1. **func_10()**: This function determines the number of iterations the loop will run. Since no variables are passed to `func_10()`, it will return a fixed value each time it is called. Let's assume `func_10()` returns `n`.

2. **func_14()**: This function is called within the loop body and its return value is printed on each iteration. Since no variables are passed to `func_14()`, it will return a fixed value each time it is called. Let's assume `func_14()` returns `m`.

Given the loop:
```python
for _ in range(func_10()):
    sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
```

The loop will iterate `n` times, and on each iteration, it will print the value `m` followed by a newline.

### Initial State:
- No variables are passed to the function `func_15()`.

### Output State:
- The loop will print the value `m` `n` times, each on a new line.

Output State: **The loop will print the value `m` `n` times, each on a new line.**
