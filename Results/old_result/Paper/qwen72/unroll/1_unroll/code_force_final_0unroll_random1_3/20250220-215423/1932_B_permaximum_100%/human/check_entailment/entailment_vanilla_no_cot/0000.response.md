Correctness: **False**

The given program has a logical error in how it calculates the next year for each sign. Specifically, the logic for determining the next year when the current year is already a multiple of the sign's periodicity is incorrect. If the current year is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year should be `current_year + ai`, but the program incorrectly sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai` in this case, which is redundant and incorrect. Instead, it should just set `current_year` to `next_year` without adding `ai` again.

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

With this correction, the program will correctly determine the year in which the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.
