**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of `n` integers.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` to 0, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the integers that have been added to the permutation.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` (`minn`) is added to `mex`, and `minn` is updated to the next smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` is added to `mex`, and this value is marked as used in the `used` dictionary.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation `mex`, the program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces.
   - A newline is printed after each test case to separate the outputs.

5. **Validation:**
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given `arr` and the MEX calculation.
   - The logic ensures that the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is always found and used appropriately.
   - The program prints the permutation for each test case as required.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `arr[i]` is positive or non-positive correctly.
   - It ensures that all integers from 0 to `n-1` are used exactly once in the permutation.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly construct a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a` and prints it as required.

**Correctness: **True****

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.
