Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function checks if either dimension `a` or `b` is even and can be split into two equal parts that are not equal to the other dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both dimensions are odd, it directly prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
