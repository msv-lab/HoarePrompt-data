Reasoning:  
The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer. The key challenge is to count the configurations where no two rooks attack each other, and the computer's mirroring move is handled appropriately.

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. These values represent the number of valid configurations for a 1x1 and 2x2 chessboard, respectively.
   - For a 1x1 board, there is only one configuration: no rooks.
   - For a 2x2 board, there are three configurations: no rooks, one white rook at (1, 2) and one black rook at (2, 1), and one white rook at (2, 1) and one black rook at (1, 2).

2. **Dynamic Programming Formula**:
   - The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is used to calculate the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board.
   - `dp[i - 1]` represents the number of configurations where the \( i \)-th row and column are not used.
   - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` represents the number of configurations where the \( i \)-th row and column are used, but the rook is placed in one of the \( i - 1 \) positions in the \( i \)-th row and column, and the remaining \( i - 2 \) rows and columns are used in valid configurations.

3. **Handling Initial Moves**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the initial moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The number of remaining valid positions is `n - len(invalid)`, and the program uses the precomputed `dp` array to find the number of possible final configurations for the remaining positions.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]` modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n - len(invalid)` is 0 or 1 correctly by ensuring `dp` is initialized properly and using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` to avoid printing 0 when there are no valid moves left.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming solution to count the number of valid configurations, taking into account the initial moves and the computer's mirroring strategy.

Correctness: **True**
