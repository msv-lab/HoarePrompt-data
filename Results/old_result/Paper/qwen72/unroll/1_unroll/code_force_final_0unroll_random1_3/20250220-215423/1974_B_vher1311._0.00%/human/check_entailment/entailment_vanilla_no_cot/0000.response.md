Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the way it handles the replacement of characters in the string `s` is incorrect. Here are the issues:

1. **Character Replacement Logic**:
   - The program attempts to replace each character in the string `s` with its symmetric character from the `unique_chars` list. However, the `replace` method is used in a loop, which can lead to unintended replacements if the same character appears more than once in the string.
   - For example, if the string `s` contains multiple occurrences of the same character, the `replace` method will replace all occurrences at once, which is not the intended behavior for decoding.

2. **Inserting Characters**:
   - The program incorrectly inserts characters into the `unique_chars` list, which is not necessary for the decoding process. The `unique_chars` list should only contain the distinct characters from the string `s` in sorted order.

3. **Returning the Wrong Result**:
   - The function returns `unique_chars` joined into a string, which is not the decoded string. Instead, it should return the modified string `s` after all replacements have been made.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - 1 - i] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Unique Characters**:
   - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the string `s`.

2. **Mapping**:
   - A dictionary `mapping` is created to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character.

3. **Decoding**:
   - The decoded string is constructed by replacing each character in the input string `s` with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.

This corrected program will correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement.
