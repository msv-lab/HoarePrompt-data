You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

The output for each test case is printed as 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color by performing a series of operations. Each operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a grid of 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters.
   - The output for each test case is "YES" if it's possible to make all squares the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If the grid is already all one color, the answer is "YES".
   - If the grid is not all one color, we need to check if it's possible to make it all one color by the given operations.
   - The operations can only change the color of a subrectangle if the two selected squares are of the same color.

4. **Logic in the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in a list `gr`.
   - The initial assumption is that it is possible to make all squares the same color (`ans = 'YES'`).
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) are different colors.
   - If they are different, it checks if there is any color change along the top row or the bottom row (`for j in range(m - 1)`).
   - If there is no color change along the top or bottom row, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if there is any color change along the left column or the right column (`for i in range(n - 1)`).
   - If there is no color change along the left or right column, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

5. **Analysis of the Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies if the grid is already all one color.
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners are different, it checks if there is a consistent color along the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns.
   - However, the logic for determining if it's impossible to make all squares the same color is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns, but it should consider the entire grid.

6. **Flaw in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle cases where the grid has a consistent color along the top and bottom rows or the left and right columns, but the interior of the grid has different colors.
   - For example, consider a grid where the top and bottom rows are all 'W', and the left and right columns are all 'W', but the interior is all 'B'. The program would incorrectly output 'NO' in this case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not fully consider the possibility of making the entire grid the same color by checking only the top, bottom, left, and right edges.
