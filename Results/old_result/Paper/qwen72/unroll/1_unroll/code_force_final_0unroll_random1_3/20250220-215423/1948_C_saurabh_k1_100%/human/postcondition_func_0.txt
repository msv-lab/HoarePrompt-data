The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The function then checks if there is any odd-indexed position `i` in the strings such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`. If such a condition is met, it prints 'No' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer read from the input, and the behavior is undefined if `t` is out of the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, or any `n` is out of the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, or `n` is not even, or the sum of all `n` values exceeds 2 · 10^5.
