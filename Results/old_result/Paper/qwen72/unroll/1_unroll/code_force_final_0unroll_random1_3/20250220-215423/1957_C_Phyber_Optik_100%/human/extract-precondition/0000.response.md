Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and the function is designed to handle a single test case without the additional parameters for multiple test cases or the moves made.** 

However, the provided function definition `def func_1(n):` does not match the problem description which requires handling multiple test cases and the moves made. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` (the size of the chessboard) and a list of moves `k` (each move represented as a tuple `(r_i, c_i)`). The precondition for this function would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) and a list of k moves (0 ≤ k ≤ n), each move represented as a tuple (r_i, c_i) of integers (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). The moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
