The code snippet `x, y = a` attempts to unpack the integer `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. However, since `a` is an integer and not an iterable with two elements, this will raise a `ValueError`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams, respectively. An error occurs because `a` cannot be unpacked into `x` and `y`.**
