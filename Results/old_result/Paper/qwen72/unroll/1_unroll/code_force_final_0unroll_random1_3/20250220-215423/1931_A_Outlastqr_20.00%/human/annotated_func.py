#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: The loop will print a series of strings based on the input values of `n` for each iteration. Each string will be constructed according to the rules specified in the loop: if `n` is greater than 52, the string will be the letter at position `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'; if `n` is between 27 and 52, the string will be 'a' followed by the letter at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and then 'z'; if `n` is between 3 and 26, the string will be 'aa' followed by the letter at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. The variable `word` will be reset to an empty string at the start of each iteration. The variable `alphabet` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` takes no parameters and reads an integer from the user input that specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads another integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and prints a string based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, the string will be the letter at position `n - 53` in the alphabet followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 27 and 52, the string will be 'a' followed by the letter at position `n - 28` in the alphabet and then 'z'. If `n` is between 3 and 26, the string will be 'aa' followed by the letter at position `n - 3` in the alphabet. The function does not return any value; it only prints the constructed strings to the console. The variable `alphabet` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
