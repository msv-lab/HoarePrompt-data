Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Modification in `func_2`**:
   - The while loop in `func_2` is modifying the elements of the array incorrectly. Specifically, the lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     are reducing `list[i - 1]` by itself, which is not the intended operation. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The current implementation can lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly. For example, if `list[i]` is greater than 1 but `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` are not greater than 0, the loop will continue indefinitely.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if all elements in the list are zero. However, the program should check if the entire array can be made zero after performing the operations, not just the elements that were modified.

4. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array cannot be made zero. For example, if the sum of the elements in the array is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to make all elements zero using the given operations.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to check if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4. If it is, then it is possible to make all elements zero. Additionally, you need to ensure that the operations can be applied in a way that does not leave any negative values in the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(a, n):
    # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
    if sum(a) % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    # Check if the array can be made zero without any negative values
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while a[i] > 1 and a[i - 1] > 0 and a[i + 1] > 0:
            a[i - 1] -= 1
            a[i] -= 2
            a[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Check if all elements are zero
    return all(x == 0 for x in a)

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if can_make_zero(a, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This program correctly checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4 and then applies the operations to see if the array can be made zero without leaving any negative values.
