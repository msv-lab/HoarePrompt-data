You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, n and m, where n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The values of `n` and `m` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop. The value of `t` will remain unchanged. The loop will have printed 'Yes' or 'No' for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the input. The function then prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the following conditions for each pair: if `n` equals `m`, if `m` is `n - 1`, or if both `n` and `m` are either even or odd. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the values of `n` and `m` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop, and `t` will remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The tower starts with 0 cubes.
   - After \( n \) moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between \( 0 \) and \( n \), inclusive, depending on the sequence of adding and removing cubes.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( n \) is even, the number of cubes in the tower can be any even number between 0 and \( n \).
   - If \( n \) is odd, the number of cubes in the tower can be any odd number between 0 and \( n \).

4. **Conditions to Check:**
   - If \( n \) is equal to \( m \), it is always possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes by adding \( m \) cubes in \( m \) moves.
   - If \( m \) is greater than \( n \), it is impossible because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If \( m \) is equal to \( n - 1 \), it is possible if \( n \) is odd (since \( n - 1 \) will be even, and adding \( n - 1 \) cubes and removing one cube will result in \( m \) cubes).
   - If \( m \) is even and \( n \) is even, it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes by adding \( m \) cubes and removing \( n - m \) cubes.
   - If \( m \) is odd and \( n \) is odd, it is possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes by adding \( m \) cubes and removing \( n - m \) cubes.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

5. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks the following conditions:
     - If \( n \) is equal to \( m \), it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m \) is greater than \( n \), it prints "No".
     - If \( m \) is equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m \) is even and \( n \) is even, it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m \) is odd and \( n \) is odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

6. **Verification:**
   - The conditions in the program correctly cover all the possible scenarios for \( n \) and \( m \) as described in the problem.
   - The logic ensures that the program will print "Yes" or "No" based on the parity and the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \).

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
