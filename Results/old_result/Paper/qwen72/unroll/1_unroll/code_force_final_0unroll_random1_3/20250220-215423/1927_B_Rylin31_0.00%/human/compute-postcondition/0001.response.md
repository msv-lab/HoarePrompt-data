Output State: **The function will print the transformed string for each test case, and the variables `i`, `l`, `array`, `alp`, `rev_array`, and `ans` will be reset for each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations, the final state of these variables will be their initial state for the last test case, with `i` being equal to `t` (the number of test cases).**
