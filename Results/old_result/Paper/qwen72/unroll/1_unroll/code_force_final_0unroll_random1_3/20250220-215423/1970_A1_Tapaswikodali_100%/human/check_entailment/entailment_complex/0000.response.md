Reasoning:

1. **BalanceInfo Class**: This class is used to store the balance, position, and character of each character in the input string. It is correctly defined and used to create instances that will be sorted later.

2. **func_1**: This function is used as a custom sorting key. It correctly compares two `BalanceInfo` objects first by their balance and then by their position in reverse order. The logic is as follows:
   - If the balances are different, it returns the difference between the balances, ensuring that the list is sorted by increasing balance.
   - If the balances are the same, it returns the difference between the positions in reverse order, ensuring that the list is sorted by decreasing position for the same balance.

3. **func_2**:
   - It initializes the balance to 0 and iterates through the input string `s`, creating a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - For each character, it updates the balance correctly: incrementing by 1 for an opening parenthesis and decrementing by 1 for a closing parenthesis.
   - After the loop, the balance should be 0, which is a property of a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It then sorts the `balance_info` list using the custom key defined in `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters in the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly computes the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The sorting logic ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the problem's requirements.
   - The final result string is printed, which should be the balanced shuffle of the input string.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation.

Correctness: **True**
