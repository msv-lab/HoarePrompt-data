The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer with a maximum value of \(10^{12}\). It modifies `k` by dividing it by 2 and initializes a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`. The function iterates over the range from `n` to 0 in steps of -2, incrementing a counter `c` at each step. If `k` becomes 0 during the iteration, the function returns the list `l`. If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1`, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, it updates `k` and modifies `l` using `func_3(c, l)`. After the loop, the function returns the final state of `l`. The final state of the program is that `c` is \(\left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil\), `k` is the result of the loop updates, and `l` is the result of applying `func_3` to `l` for each iteration or the result of `func_2` if the loop terminates early.
