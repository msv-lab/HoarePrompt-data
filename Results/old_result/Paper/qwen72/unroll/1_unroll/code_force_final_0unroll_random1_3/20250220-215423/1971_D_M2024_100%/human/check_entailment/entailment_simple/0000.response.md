### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of pieces a binary string can be cut into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters, `cut0` and `cut1`, to zero.
   - It then iterates over the string `a` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - If it encounters a '1' followed by a '0', it increments `cut1`.
   - If it encounters a '0' followed by a '1', it increments `cut0`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `cut0` is zero. If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0's followed by '1's, and the string is already sorted or can be sorted with a single cut. In this case, it prints `cut1 + 1`.
   - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are '0's followed by '1's, and the string needs to be cut into more pieces. In this case, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The logic of the program is based on counting the transitions between '1' and '0' and '0' and '1'.
   - If there are no '0's followed by '1's (`cut0 == 0`), the string can be sorted with a single cut (or no cut if it's already sorted), so the number of pieces needed is `cut1 + 1`.
   - If there are '0's followed by '1's, the string needs to be cut at each transition to ensure that all '0's can be moved to the front and all '1's to the back. The total number of pieces needed is `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Testing the Program:**
   - For the test case `11010`:
     - `cut1` is incremented twice (at positions 2 and 4).
     - `cut0` is incremented once (at position 3).
     - The output is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 2 = 3`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `00000000`:
     - `cut0` and `cut1` are both zero.
     - The output is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `1`:
     - `cut0` and `cut1` are both zero.
     - The output is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `10`:
     - `cut1` is incremented once (at position 1).
     - `cut0` is incremented once (at position 0).
     - The output is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `0001111`:
     - `cut0` and `cut1` are both zero.
     - The output is `cut1 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the test case `0110`:
     - `cut1` is incremented once (at position 2).
     - `cut0` is incremented once (at position 1).
     - The output is `cut0 + cut1 = 1 + 1 = 2`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
