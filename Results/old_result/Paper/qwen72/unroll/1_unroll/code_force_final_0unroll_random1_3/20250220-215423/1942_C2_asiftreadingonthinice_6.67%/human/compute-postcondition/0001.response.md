The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `ii` will start at 0, which is the initial state for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Given the context of the function `max_triangles(t, test_cases)`, the variable `tt` should be adjusted to match the number of test cases `t`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `tt` must be equal to `t` and `ii` must start at 0.

State: **`tt` is equal to `t`, `ii` is 0**
