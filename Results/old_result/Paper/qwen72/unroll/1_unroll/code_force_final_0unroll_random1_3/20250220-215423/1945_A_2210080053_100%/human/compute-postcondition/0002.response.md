The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. These parameters are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\), representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the given information.
