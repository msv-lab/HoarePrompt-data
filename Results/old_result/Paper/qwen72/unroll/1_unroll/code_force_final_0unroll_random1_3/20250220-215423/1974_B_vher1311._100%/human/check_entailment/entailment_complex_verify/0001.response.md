### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and large inputs, and it correctly parses the input as described in the problem constraints.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then creates a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, etc.).
   - Finally, it decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The construction of `r` ensures that all distinct characters from `b` are included and sorted in alphabetical order.
   - The mapping dictionary correctly pairs each character in `r` with its symmetric character.
   - The decoding process correctly applies the mapping to each character in `b`, restoring the original string `s`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For example, if `b` is "w", the auxiliary string `r` will be "w", and the mapping will be `{'w': 'w'}`, resulting in the correct output "w".
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters and strings of varying lengths as described in the problem constraints. For example, if `b` is "ttf", the auxiliary string `r` will be "ft", and the mapping will be `{'f': 't', 't': 'f'}`, resulting in the correct output "fft".

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them all at once, which is efficient and matches the expected output format.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
  - This is correct and matches the problem constraints.

- **Function `func_1` behavior:**
  - `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))` correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of `encoded`.
  - `mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}` correctly creates the mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is paired with its symmetric character.
  - `return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)` correctly applies the mapping to each character in `encoded` and returns the decoded string.
  - The final state of the program is that the original `encoded` string is transformed into the new string, with the characters replaced according to the specified mapping.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` to the original string `s` for each test case, following the specified algorithm and handling all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
