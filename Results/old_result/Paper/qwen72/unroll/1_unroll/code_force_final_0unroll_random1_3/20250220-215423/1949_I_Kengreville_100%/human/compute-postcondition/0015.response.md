Postcondition: **`x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited or not, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `False`.**
