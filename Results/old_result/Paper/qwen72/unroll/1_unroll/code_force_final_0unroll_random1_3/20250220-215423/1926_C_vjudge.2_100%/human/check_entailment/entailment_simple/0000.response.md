### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `pd` List:**
   - The list `pd` is initialized with `N` elements, all set to 0. `N` is set to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\), which is appropriate for the given constraints.
   - This list will be used to store the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `i` for each `i` in the range.

2. **Populating `pd` List:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, N):` iterates through each integer from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `pd[i] += pd[i - 1]` ensures that `pd[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `i-1`.
   - The inner loop `for j in str(i):` converts the integer `i` to a string, iterates through each digit, and adds the integer value of each digit to `pd[i]`.
   - This correctly computes the sum of the digits of `i` and adds it to the cumulative sum stored in `pd[i]`.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The variable `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the integer `n` is read from the input.
   - The value `pd[n]` is printed, which is the sum of the sums of digits from 1 to `n`.

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The program precomputes the sums of digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) in \(O(N \log N)\) time, where \(N = 2 \times 10^5\).
   - Each test case is handled in \(O(1)\) time by simply accessing the precomputed value in the `pd` list.
   - This is efficient enough to handle up to \(10^4\) test cases within the 0.5 seconds time limit.

5. **Correctness of Output:**
   - The program correctly computes the sum of the sums of digits for each `n` and prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
