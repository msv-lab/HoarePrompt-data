The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `min_indices`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `min_indices` list. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `i` will be the first element of `min_indices` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `max_index` is `n-1`
- `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns `'='` or the smallest index `i` where `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns `'<'`
- `min_index` is `min_indices[0]`

For the loop to execute, `min_indices` must have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `min_indices`.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list that must have at least one element, `min_index` is `min_indices[0]`, `i` is the first element of `min_indices`**
