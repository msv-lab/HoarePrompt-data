Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `a` consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 <= |a| <= 500). The function calculates and prints the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string `a` into a sorted binary string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the value of `t` is unchanged, and the input strings `a` remain the same. **
