#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers where b >= 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns the values 1 and 0.

    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the results of the function `func_1(b, a)`. Since `b` is a positive integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`, the specific values of `d` and `c` depend on the implementation of `func_1`. Without the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine the exact values of `d` and `c`.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b.
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of a divided by b, minus one. Given that a is divisible by b, the quotient (a // b) is an integer, and the second value will be a negative integer.
    #State: a and b are integers where b >= 0, and b is not equal to 0. Additionally, a is greater than or equal to b, and a % b is not equal to 0.
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns `d` and the result of `c - a // b * d`, where `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. `d` is an integer, and the result of `c - a // b * d` is also an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` where `b` is non-negative. It returns a tuple of two integers based on the following conditions: (1) If `b` is 0, it returns (1, 0). (2) If `a` is less than `b`, it returns the results of `func_1(b, a)` but swaps the order of the returned values. (3) If `a` is divisible by `b`, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)), where the second value is the negative of the quotient of `a` divided by `b`, minus one. (4) In all other cases, it returns the second value from `func_1(b, a % b)` and a computed value based on the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, b is a list of integers, and the length of b is at least 1.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the result of (c * a) % 1000000007, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, `a` is an integer, and `b` is a list of integers with a length of at least 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` with a length of at least 1. It returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is the first value returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` or `b`.
