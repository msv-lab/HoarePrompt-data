Reasoning:  
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `m`, and a string `a` of problem difficulties.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: For each test case, the program initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 elements (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the ASCII value of the character (subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' to get the index).

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This expression ensures that if the frequency of a difficulty level is already greater than or equal to `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level. The sum of these values gives the total number of missing problems.

4. **Result Collection**: The calculated number of missing problems for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

5. **Output**: The function returns the `results` list, which contains the minimum number of problems needed for each test case.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. The example provided in the problem statement is also correctly solved by the program.
