Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic checks if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, considering the constraints and the nature of the moves (adding or removing one cube at a time). Here's a breakdown of the conditions:

1. **If `n == m`:** This means Nikita can simply add one cube per move for `n` moves to get exactly `m` cubes. This is always possible, so the answer is "Yes".
2. **If `m > n`:** It's impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
3. **If `m == n - 1`:** This means Nikita can add one cube for `n-1` moves and then remove one cube, ending up with `m` cubes. This is possible, so the answer is "Yes".
4. **If `m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0`:** If both `m` and `n` are even, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in a way that maintains the even parity of the number of cubes. The answer is "Yes".
5. **If `m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`:** If both `m` and `n` are odd, it's possible to end up with `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in a way that maintains the odd parity of the number of cubes. The answer is "Yes".
6. **Otherwise:** If none of the above conditions are met, it's not possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, so the answer is "No".

The program correctly handles all these cases and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
