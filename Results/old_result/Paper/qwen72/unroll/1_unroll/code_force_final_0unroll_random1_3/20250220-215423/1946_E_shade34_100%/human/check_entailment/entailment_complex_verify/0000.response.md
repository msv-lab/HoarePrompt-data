### Reasoning

The original assessment claims that the provided program is incorrect because the functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly match the problem description. However, this assessment is incomplete and does not consider the entire program. Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Factorial Precomputation**:
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   This block precomputes the factorials of numbers from 0 to 200001 and stores them in the list `facts`. This is a common optimization technique for problems involving combinatorial calculations, as it allows for quick access to factorial values later.

2. **Input Handling**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   This block reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the values of `n`, `m1`, and `m2`, followed by the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices `p` and `s`.

3. **Initial Validity Check**:
   ```python
   if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
       print(0)
   ```
   This check ensures that the given indices are consistent with the properties of prefix and suffix maximums:
   - The last prefix maximum index should be the same as the first suffix maximum index.
   - The first prefix maximum index should be 1.
   - The last suffix maximum index should be `n`.

   If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   ```python
   ans = 1
   kol = n
   for x in s:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = n - x
   ```
   This loop calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums. The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of the denominator in the combination formula, which is necessary for calculating the number of valid permutations.

5. **Prefix Maximums Handling**:
   ```python
   kol = s[0] - 1
   p2 = []
   for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
       p2.append(p[i])
   for x in p2:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = x - 1
   ```
   This block handles the prefix maximums similarly to the suffix maximums, ensuring that the elements between the prefix maximums are correctly arranged.

6. **Final Permutations Calculation**:
   ```python
   for i in range(m1 - 1):
       ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   for i in range(m2 - 1):
       ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   print(ans)
   ```
   This block multiplies the number of ways to arrange the elements between each pair of consecutive prefix and suffix maximums. The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Function Analysis

- **`func_1(a, b)`**:
  - This function is indeed related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the modular inverse. The function returns a tuple `(c, d)` such that `a * c + b * d = gcd(a, b)`. When `b` is \(10^9 + 7\), `c` is the modular inverse of `a` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **`func_2(a, b)`**:
  - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `b` and then returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`. This is used to compute the combination formula in modular arithmetic.

### Final Evaluation

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. It uses precomputed factorials and modular inverses to efficiently calculate the combinations, ensuring the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The initial assessment was incorrect because it did not consider the full context and the purpose of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` in the overall program. These functions are essential for the correct calculation of the number of permutations.

**Final: True**
