To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`.

1. **`results` must be a non-empty list**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The state before the loop indicates that `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is an integer provided by the user and 1 <= t <= 1000. This means `results` is guaranteed to have at least one element, as `t` cannot be 0.

2. **`result` is the first element in `results`**: At the start of the loop, `result` will be the first element in the `results` list.

Given these points, the state can be adjusted as follows:

State: **`t` is the input integer provided by the user, where 1 <= t <= 1000; `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` for the corresponding iteration; `result` is the first element in `results`**
