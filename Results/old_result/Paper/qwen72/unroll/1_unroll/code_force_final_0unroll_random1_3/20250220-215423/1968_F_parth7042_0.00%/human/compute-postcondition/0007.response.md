To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `idx` is calculated as `1 + 2 * t + 2 * sum(n + q for n, q, _, _ in test_cases)`.
2. `results` is a list containing the results of each test case query followed by an empty string for each test case.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list where each element is the result of a test case query followed by an empty string.
   - This means that for each test case, there are two entries in `results`: the result of the test case and an empty string.

2. **Understanding `idx`**:
   - `idx` is a complex expression that depends on `t` and the elements of `test_cases`.
   - The exact value of `idx` is not necessary for determining the output of the `print` statement, but it helps to understand the context.

3. **Constructing `results`**:
   - If there are `m` test cases, `results` will have `2 * m` elements.
   - Each pair of elements in `results` will be: `[result of test case i, '']` for `i` from `0` to `m-1`.

4. **`print('\n'.join(results))`**:
   - The `join` method will concatenate all elements of `results` into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that the output will be a series of lines, where each line is either the result of a test case or an empty line.

### Final Output:
Since `results` contains the results of each test case query followed by an empty string for each test case, the `print` statement will output each result on a new line, followed by an empty line for each test case.

Output: **[result of test case 0]
[empty line]
[result of test case 1]
[empty line]
...
[result of test case (m-1)]
[empty line]**

Where `m` is the number of test cases, and each `[result of test case i]` is the result of the corresponding test case query.
