The function `func_1` is described with a scenario that involves handling multiple test cases, each containing a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format. However, the provided function signature does not include parameters for the string `s` or the number of test cases `t`. Assuming this is an oversight, and based on the given constraints, the function should accept two parameters: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59).

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It processes each test case and returns the processed result for each valid time string.**
