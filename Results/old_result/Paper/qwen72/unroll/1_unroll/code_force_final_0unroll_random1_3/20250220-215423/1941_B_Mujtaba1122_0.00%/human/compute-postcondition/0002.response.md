Postcondition: **The list will be modified such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` will be set to 0, `list[i]` will be reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` will be reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process will continue until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, will not be modified by the loop. Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`.**
