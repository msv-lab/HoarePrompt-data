### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the primary issue with the `func_2` function. The logic in the `func_2` function is flawed because it incorrectly decrements the elements of the list. Specifically, the lines:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

are incorrect. The intended operation should be:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

This is a critical error because the current implementation does not perform the required operation correctly. Instead of decrementing `list[i - 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i + 1]` by 1, it is decrementing `list[i - 1]` by its own value, which is not the intended behavior.

### Additional Issues:

1. **Efficiency and Correctness:**
   - The program does not check if the sum of the elements is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be made all zeros. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4 (1 + 2 + 1).
   - The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be made all zeros due to the sum condition or other constraints.

2. **Test Case Failure:**
   - The provided test case:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 3 5 5 2
     ```
     should output "YES" because it is possible to make all elements zero. However, the current implementation outputs "NO" due to the incorrect operation logic.

### Corrected Implementation:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4.
2. Apply the operations correctly to see if we can make all elements zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(list, n):
    total_sum = sum(list)
    if total_sum % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    
    return all(x == 0 for x in list)

def func_2(list, n):
    if can_make_zero(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage:
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

for n, list in test_cases:
    func_2(list, n)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the primary issue with the `func_2` function. The program is incorrect due to the flawed operation logic and the lack of a necessary condition check (sum divisibility by 4).

Final: **False**
