Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Reading `n` and the List**: For each test case, the function reads an integer `n` and a list of 2n integers. This is also consistent with the problem description.

3. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list of integers. Sorting is a crucial step because it ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is necessary to maximize the score. By sorting the list, we can always pick the smallest number in each pair, which will be the minimum value.

4. **Calculating the Score**: The function calculates the score by iterating through the sorted list in steps of 2 and adding the first number in each pair to the score. This is correct because, in a sorted list, the first number in each pair is guaranteed to be the minimum of that pair.

5. **Output**: The function prints the score for each test case, which is the expected output format.

6. **Resetting the Score**: The score is reset to 0 for each test case, ensuring that the score for each test case is calculated independently.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
