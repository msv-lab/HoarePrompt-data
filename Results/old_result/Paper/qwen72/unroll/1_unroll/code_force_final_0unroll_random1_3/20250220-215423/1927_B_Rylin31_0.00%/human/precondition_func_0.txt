The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the trace of a string s of length n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5), with each trace element a_i (0 \le a_i < n) being a non-negative integer. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
