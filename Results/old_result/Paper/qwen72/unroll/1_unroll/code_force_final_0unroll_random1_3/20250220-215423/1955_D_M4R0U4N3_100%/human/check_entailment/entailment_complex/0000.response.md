Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function initializes `cnt_b` as a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1` (1,000,001). This is used to count the occurrences of elements in array `b`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It updates `cnt_b` to count the occurrences of elements in `b`.

3. **Initial Subarray Check**:
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subarray of `a`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `b_values` (a set of unique elements in `b`).
   - If an element is in `b_values`, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - It checks if `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if true.

4. **Sliding Window**:
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - For each new position of the window, it updates the counts in `cnt_b` and `curr`:
     - It increments the count of the element that is being removed from the window and adjusts `curr` if necessary.
     - It decrements the count of the element that is being added to the window and adjusts `curr` if necessary.
   - It checks if the updated `curr` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if true.

5. **Output and Reset**:
   - After processing all subarrays for a test case, it prints the value of `ans`.
   - It resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

6. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases does not exceed the specified limits.
   - It correctly handles the case where `k` is equal to `m` (all elements must match).

7. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that contain at least `k` elements from `b`.
   - The sliding window approach ensures that the function efficiently processes each subarray in linear time.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
