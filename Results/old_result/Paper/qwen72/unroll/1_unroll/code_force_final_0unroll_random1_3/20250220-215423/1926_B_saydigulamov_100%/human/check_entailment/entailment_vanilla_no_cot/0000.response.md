Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the shape drawn on the grid. Here are the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the size of the grid correctly, but it does not handle the grid input properly. It only counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.

2. **Shape Determination**: The program checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal to determine if the shape is a square. This is insufficient because:
   - A square can have more than two rows, and all rows should have the same number of '1's.
   - A triangle can have more than two rows, and the number of '1's in each row should form a specific pattern (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ... for a right-side-up triangle or 5, 3, 1 for an upside-down triangle).

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the shape might be an upside-down triangle or a square with more than two rows.

To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
- Count the number of '1's in each row.
- Check if the counts form a sequence that matches the pattern of a triangle (either right-side-up or upside-down).
- Check if the counts are all the same, indicating a square.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(k):
    n = len(k)
    for i in range(n):
        if k[i] != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_upside_down_triangle(k):
    n = len(k)
    for i in range(n):
        if k[i] != 2 * (n - i) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(k):
    return all(x == k[0] for x in k)

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        k = []
        for _ in range(n):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if is_square(k):
            print('SQUARE')
        elif is_triangle(k) or is_upside_down_triangle(k):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')  # This should never happen if the input is guaranteed to be a valid shape

func()
```

This corrected version includes functions to check for the triangle and square patterns and uses them to determine the shape correctly.
