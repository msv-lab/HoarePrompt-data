Output State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`.** 

Explanation: The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_7()`. Since the specific values returned by `func_7()` are not provided, we can only state that `n` and `m` now hold the values returned by this function. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 remains valid if `func_7()` returns values within this range.
