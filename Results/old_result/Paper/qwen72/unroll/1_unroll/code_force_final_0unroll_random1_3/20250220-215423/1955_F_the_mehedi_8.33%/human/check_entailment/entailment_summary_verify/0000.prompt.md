You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a sequence of four integers `p_i` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200`) from the input, calculates a value `cnt` based on the sequence, and prints `cnt`. The value `cnt` is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the sequence are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in the sequence by 2. The function does not modify the input values `t` or `p_i`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the counts of the numbers are such that Bob can win more than once. Specifically, the program incorrectly increments the count of Bob's wins by 1 if the counts of 1, 2, and 3 are all equal and odd. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`. According to the program, Bob wins only once, but in reality, Bob can win multiple times depending on the sequence of removals. The program also does not correctly handle the removal of numbers to maximize Bob's wins, as it simply adds the floor division of each count by 2, which does not necessarily lead to the optimal number of wins for Bob.
