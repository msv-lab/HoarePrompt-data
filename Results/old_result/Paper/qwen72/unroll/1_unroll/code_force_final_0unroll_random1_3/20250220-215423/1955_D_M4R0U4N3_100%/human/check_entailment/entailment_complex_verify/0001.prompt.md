You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, `max_val` is 1000000, and `ans` is the number of valid subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are in `b` and have not been counted more than once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the lengths of two arrays `a` and `b`, the required number of matching elements `k`, and the arrays themselves. It then counts the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements match elements in `b` and have not been counted more than once. The function prints the count of such valid subarrays for each test case. After processing all test cases, `cnt_b` is reset to a list of 1000001 zeros, `max_val` remains 1000000, and no value is returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The function `func()` initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Reading Test Case Data:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

3. **Counting Frequencies in `b`:**
   - It populates the `cnt_b` list with the frequencies of elements in `b`.

4. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subsegment.
   - It checks the first subsegment of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in the first subsegment, if it is in `b_values` (a set of unique elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subsegments of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each new element added to the window (`a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
     - For each element removed from the window (`a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

6. **Resetting `cnt_b`:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly initializes and processes each test case.
- The sliding window approach is used effectively to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
- The conditions for updating `curr` and `ans` are correctly implemented.
- The program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the next test case, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
