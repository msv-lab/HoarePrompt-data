### Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in an array that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. Let's break down the program and its functions to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(func_1()):
       n = func_1()
       arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))
       m = max(arr)
       ans = 0
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           a = bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)
           d = a - i
           ans = max(ans, d)
       print(ans)
   ```
   - The outer loop runs for `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user.
   - For each test case, `n` is the length of the array `a`.
   - `arr` is created by reading the array from the user, converting it to a set to remove duplicates, and then sorting it.
   - `m` is the maximum value in the sorted array `arr`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 and will store the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
   - The inner loop iterates over each element in `arr`.
   - `a` is the index where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `arr`.
   - `d` is the difference between `a` and `i`, which represents the number of elements in `arr` that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.
   - `ans` is updated to the maximum value of `d` found during the loop.
   - Finally, the maximum value `ans` is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1():
       return int(input())
   ```
   - This function reads an integer from the user and returns it. It is used to read the number of test cases and the length of the array for each test case.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   ```python
   def func_3():
       return list(map(int, input().split()))
   ```
   - This function reads a line of space-separated integers from the user, converts them to a list of integers, and returns the list. It is used to read the elements of the array `a` for each test case.

4. **Function `func_4` and `func_5` to `func_9`:**
   - These functions are not used in the main program and do not contribute to the solution. They are irrelevant to the problem and can be ignored.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- **Removing Duplicates and Sorting:**
  - The program removes duplicates from the array and sorts it. This is a good approach because we are interested in the unique elements and their relative positions.
- **Using `bisect_left`:**
  - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted in the sorted array. This is efficient and helps in counting the number of elements that can be made equal.
- **Counting Elements:**
  - The difference `a - i` gives the count of elements in the sorted array that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation. This is because `a` is the position where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted, and `i` is the current position.
- **Updating the Answer:**
  - The program updates `ans` to the maximum value of `d` found during the loop, which is the correct approach to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles multiple test cases, reads the input correctly, processes the array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation, and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
