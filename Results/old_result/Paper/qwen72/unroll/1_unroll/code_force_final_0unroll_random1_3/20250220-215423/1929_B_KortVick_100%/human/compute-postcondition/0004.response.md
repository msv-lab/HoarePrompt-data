Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2) that should have at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `n` and `k` read from the input, and `t` remains unchanged. **
