You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. results is a list containing t elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). sequence is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., sequence = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]).
    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' containing 't' elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The 'sequence' list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` tuples, each of which is `(25, sequence)`, where `sequence` is a list of 25 elements, each element being 2 raised to the power of its index from 0 to 24.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'results' containing 't' elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The 'sequence' list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
