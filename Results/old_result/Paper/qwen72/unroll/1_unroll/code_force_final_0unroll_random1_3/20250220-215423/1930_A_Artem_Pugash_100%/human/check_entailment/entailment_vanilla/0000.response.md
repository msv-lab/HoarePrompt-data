Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given 2n positive integers on a whiteboard.
   - We need to perform n moves where each move involves selecting two integers, adding the minimum of the two to our score, and then erasing them.
   - The goal is to maximize the final score.

2. **Approach**:
   - To maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available number as the minimum value in each move.
   - Sorting the list of numbers ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first.
   - After sorting, we can pair the numbers in a way that the smallest number in each pair is added to the score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - Read the value of n.
     - Read the 2n integers and sort them.
     - Initialize the score to 0.
     - Iterate through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
     - Print the score.

4. **Explanation of the Code**:
   - `for _ in range(int(input())):`: This loop runs for the number of test cases.
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the value of n for the current test case.
   - `l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`: Reads the 2n integers, converts them to a list of integers, and sorts the list.
   - `score = 0`: Initializes the score to 0.
   - `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):`: Iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element).
   - `score += l[i]`: Adds the current element to the score.
   - `print(score)`: Prints the final score for the current test case.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The approach of sorting the list and taking every second element ensures that we are always adding the smallest available number in each pair to the score.
   - This strategy guarantees that we maximize the score because the smallest numbers are used first, which is optimal for the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
