Output State: **The output state is the same as the initial state, except that the loop has been executed for each test case, and the results of the queries have been printed. The variables `d1` and `d2` will have been populated with the calculated distances for each city, but these are not part of the initial state and are not required to be described in the output state. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, and `m` will have been processed, and the input for the next test case will be ready to be read.**

To break it down further:
- The variable `t` will still represent the number of test cases, but the loop will have completed all `t` iterations.
- For each test case, the variables `n`, `l`, and `m` will have been used to process the input and generate the corresponding output.
- The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` will have been used to store intermediate results, but they are not part of the initial state and are not required to be described in the output state.
- The input for the next test case (if any) will be ready to be read, and the loop will start again with the next test case.

Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state in terms of the variables that are part of the initial state, but the loop will have completed its execution for all test cases.
