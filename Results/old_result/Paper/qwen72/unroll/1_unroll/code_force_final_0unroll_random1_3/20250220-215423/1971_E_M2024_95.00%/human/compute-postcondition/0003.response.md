The function `func` accepts multiple parameters for each test case. The parameters are:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, representing the final destination.
  - `k`: an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5, representing the number of known points.
  - `q`: an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `a`: a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, with a_k = n.
  - `b`: a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1.
  - `d`: a list of q integers where 0 ≤ d ≤ n, representing the distances for which Timur wants to know the time.

The function returns the time for each distance in the list `d` based on the known points and their corresponding times in lists `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `d`. For each test case, it returns the time for each distance in the list `d` based on the known points and their corresponding times in lists `a` and `b`.**
