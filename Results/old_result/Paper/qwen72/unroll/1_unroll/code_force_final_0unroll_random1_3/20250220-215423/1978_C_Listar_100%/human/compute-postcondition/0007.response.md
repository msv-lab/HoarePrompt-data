Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

In this case, the `return` statement is used without specifying any value or variable to return. Therefore, the program does not return any value. The variables `n`, `k`, `l`, and the functions `func_4()`, `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` are not directly affected by this `return` statement, and their values or results are not returned.
