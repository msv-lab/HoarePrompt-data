### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
   - Each integer is replaced by the sum of its digits.
   - We need to find the sum of these digit sums for all integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases \( t \).
   - Each of the next \( t \) lines contains an integer \( n \).
   - For each \( n \), we need to output the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program uses a precomputed array `pd` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - The array `pd` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( N \) (where \( N = 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \)):
     - `pd[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of \( i \).
   - This precomputation step ensures that for any given \( n \), the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( n \) can be retrieved in constant time \( O(1) \).

4. **Precomputation**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(N \times \log_{10}(N)) \) time, where \( N = 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \).
   - This is efficient because \( \log_{10}(N) \) is a small constant (around 6 for \( N = 2 \times 10^5 \)).

5. **Query Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer \( n \) and prints `pd[n]`.
   - This step runs in \( O(t) \) time, where \( t \) is the number of test cases.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step is \( O(N \times \log_{10}(N)) \).
   - The query handling step is \( O(t) \).
   - Given the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), the program should run within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - The query handling step correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed values for each \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient given the constraints. It precomputes the required values and handles queries in constant time, ensuring it meets the time limit requirement.

Correctness: **True**
