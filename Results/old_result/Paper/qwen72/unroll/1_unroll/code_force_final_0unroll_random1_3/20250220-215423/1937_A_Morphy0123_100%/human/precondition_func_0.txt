The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array a. The array a is initially set such that a_i = i for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function should return the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations for each i from 2 to n.
