The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The state of `cnt_b` and `max_val` do not affect the loop's execution directly, and the function `func` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is not yet defined, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
