The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k` (0 <= k <= 10^12). It returns a modified list `l` of integers from 1 to `n` where the last element of the list is moved to a new position based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, the function returns the list `l` unchanged. If `1 + i > k` for any iteration, the last element is moved to the position `-k` in the list, and the function returns the modified list. Otherwise, the last element is repeatedly moved to the beginning of the list until the loop completes, and the function returns the final modified list.
