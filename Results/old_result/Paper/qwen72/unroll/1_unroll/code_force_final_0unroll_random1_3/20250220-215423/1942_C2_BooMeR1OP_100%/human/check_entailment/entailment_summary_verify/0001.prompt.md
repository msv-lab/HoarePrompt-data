You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs and processes each set to calculate and print a result. For each set, it accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a list of `x` distinct integers. The function then calculates the number of valid positions to place a new element in the list, considering the constraints and the gaps between the elements. The final result, `ans`, is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function returns to its initial state, ready to process the next set of inputs.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` which represent the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, respectively.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and stores them in a list `a`.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because a polygon with `x` vertices can be divided into `x - 2` triangles by drawing diagonals from one vertex to all other non-adjacent vertices.

3. **Adjusting the Vertices:**
   - The vertices in `a` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to make them 0-indexed.
   - A set `st` is created from the list `a` to quickly check if a vertex is in the set of chosen vertices.
   - The list `a` is sorted to facilitate the calculation of gaps between chosen vertices.

4. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list `a` and checks if the next vertex `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in the set `st` and the vertex after that `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in the set `st`.
   - If this condition is met, it means a triangle can be formed by adding the vertex `(a[i] + 1) % n` to the set, and `ans` is incremented by 1.

5. **Calculating Gaps:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - These gaps are categorized into `odd` and `even` lists based on whether the gap length is odd or even.

6. **Maximizing Triangles with Additional Vertices:**
   - The program sorts the `odd` and `even` lists to prioritize smaller gaps first.
   - It then iterates over the `odd` gaps and checks if the remaining `y` vertices can be used to form additional triangles.
   - If the gap is larger than `2 * y`, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and sets `y` to 0, breaking out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds the gap length to `ans` and decreases `y` by `gap // 2`.
   - The same process is repeated for the `even` gaps.

7. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly initializes the answer based on the number of chosen vertices.
- It correctly identifies additional triangles that can be formed by adding a single vertex between existing chosen vertices.
- The gaps between chosen vertices are correctly categorized and sorted.
- The program efficiently uses the remaining `y` vertices to maximize the number of triangles by prioritizing smaller gaps first.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
