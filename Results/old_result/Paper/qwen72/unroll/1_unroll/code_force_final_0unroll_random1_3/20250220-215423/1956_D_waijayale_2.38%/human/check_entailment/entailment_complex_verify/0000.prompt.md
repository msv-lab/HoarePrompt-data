You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

If `l` equals `r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if `a[l]` is not already 0 and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops` if the change was made. If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively processes the sublist from `l + 1` to `r`. If `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to `ops`. The function returns without any value, and the final state of `a` and `ops` depends on the initial values and the recursive calls.

If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where `a` is a list of integers. It modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` in the following ways: If the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist, it updates all elements in this sublist to the length of the sublist and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, it recursively applies the same logic to the sublists before and after the maximum element in `a[l:r + 1]`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` will have been modified according to the rules described, and the list `ops` will contain tuples representing the ranges of sublists that were updated.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_3`. The function reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array `a`. The array `a` is then read from the input as a list of `n` integers.

    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged. The loop prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair `(l, r)` in `ops`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of an array `a`. It then reads `a` as a list of `n` integers from the input. The function calls another function `func_2` with the array `a` and receives three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. It prints `s` and `m`, where `s` is the sum of some elements in `a` and `m` is the maximum or minimum value of some elements in `a`. Additionally, it prints the values of `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair `(l, r)` in `ops`. The function does not return any values. The original values of `n`, `a`, `s`, and `m` remain unchanged after the function concludes.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` without passing the `ops` list, which is required for the function `func_1` to append operations. This will result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the MEX operation as described in the problem. The MEX operation should set the values in the range `[l, r]` to the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray. However, the program sets the values to `r - l + 1`, which is not necessarily the MEX of the subarray.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  10 1
  1 4
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will likely raise an error or produce incorrect results because of the issues mentioned above.

To fix the program, `recursive_maximize_sum` should be modified to accept and pass the `ops` list, and the MEX calculation should be implemented correctly.
