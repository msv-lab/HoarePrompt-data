### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Odd-Numbered Cards:**
   - The first condition checks if `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`. This condition is true if `k` is within the range of the first half of the cards, which are all odd-numbered.
   - If this condition is true, the function prints `2 * k - 1`, which correctly corresponds to the k-th odd number in the sequence 1, 3, 5, ..., (2 * k - 1).

3. **Handling Larger `k` Values:**
   - If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function enters a more complex logic to determine the k-th card.
   - The variable `s` is used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `d` is initialized to `n` and is used to count the remaining cards.
   - The variable `i` is used to count the number of iterations (or steps) in the process.
   - The while loop `while s < k and d > 0` is used to simulate the process of laying down cards in steps. In each step, it adds the number of odd-numbered cards that can be laid down from the remaining cards to `s` and updates `d` to the remaining cards.
   - The variable `h` is initialized to `n` and is used similarly to `d` to count the remaining cards.
   - The variable `p` is used to count the number of steps already taken.
   - The while loop `while p <= i - 1` is used to calculate the total number of cards laid down in the previous steps and store it in `g`.
   - The variable `f` is then calculated as `k - g`, which represents the position of the card within the current step.
   - Finally, the value `y` is calculated as `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, which correctly identifies the k-th card in the sequence.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated value for each test case.

  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The third card laid down is 5 (the third odd number).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `n = 7, k = 4`
  - Output: `7`
  - Explanation: The fourth card laid down is 7 (the fourth odd number).

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `n = 7, k = 5`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The fifth card laid down is 2 (the first card that is twice an odd number).

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `n = 7, k = 6`
  - Output: `6`
  - Explanation: The sixth card laid down is 6 (the second card that is twice an odd number).

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `n = 7, k = 7`
  - Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The seventh card laid down is 4 (the only card that is 4 times an odd number).

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `n = 1, k = 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The only card is 1.

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `n = 34, k = 14`
  - Output: `27`
  - Explanation: The 14th card laid down is 27, which is 3 times an odd number.

- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `n = 84, k = 19`
  - Output: `37`
  - Explanation: The 19th card laid down is 37, which is 5 times an odd number.

- **Test Case 11:**
  - Input: `n = 1000000000, k = 1000000000`
  - Output: `536870912`
  - Explanation: The 1000000000th card laid down is 536870912, which is 2^29 times an odd number.
