You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= |s| <= 500, and return an integer representing the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        cut0 = 0
        
        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged, and `s` remains the same string consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The loop prints a number for each iteration based on the input string `a` provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `a` consisting of characters '0' and '1' (1 <= |a| <= 500). The function calculates and prints the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string `a` into a sorted binary string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the value of `t` is unchanged, and the input strings `a` remain the same.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to cut the binary string into the minimum number of pieces such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters: `cut0` and `cut1`.
   - It iterates through the string `a` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
     - If the current character is '1' and the next character is '0', it increments `cut1`.
     - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it increments `cut0`.
   - After the loop, it checks if `cut0` is zero.
     - If `cut0` is zero, it prints `cut1 + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Logic Explanation:**
   - `cut0` counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - `cut1` counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), the string is already sorted, and we only need to count the transitions from '1' to '0' plus one piece for the entire string.
   - If there are transitions from '0' to '1', we need to count both types of transitions and add them together to get the minimum number of pieces.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Character String:**
     - If the string is "0" or "1", there are no transitions, and the program correctly prints 1.
   - **Already Sorted String:**
     - If the string is "00000000" or "11111111", there are no transitions from '0' to '1', and the program correctly prints 1.
   - **Strings with Transitions:**
     - For "10", the program correctly identifies one transition from '1' to '0' and prints 2.
     - For "0110", the program correctly identifies one transition from '0' to '1' and one transition from '1' to '0', and prints 2.
   - **Strings with Multiple Transitions:**
     - For "11010", the program correctly identifies two transitions from '1' to '0' and one transition from '0' to '1', and prints 3.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the edge cases and the general logic for determining the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
