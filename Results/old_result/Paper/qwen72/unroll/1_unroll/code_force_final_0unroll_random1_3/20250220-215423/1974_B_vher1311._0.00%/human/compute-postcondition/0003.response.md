Output State: **`s` is a string where all characters have been replaced by the last character in the `unique_chars` list, and `unique_chars` contains all unique characters from the initial `s` in their original order, plus any characters that were not in `unique_chars` initially, inserted at the beginning of the list. `i` is the number of unique characters that were not in the initial `unique_chars` list, and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1` minus the number of unique characters in the initial `s`.**
