### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of different permutations of length \( n \) that could have the given indices as their prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function is indeed implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function is used to find the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(b\). Specifically, when \(b = 10^9 + 7\), it finds the modular inverse of \(a\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \(b\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It then returns \(a \cdot c \mod 10^9 + 7\), where \(c\) is the modular inverse of \(b\).

4. **Permutation Calculation**:
   - The program precomputes factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and stores them in the `facts` list.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values \(n\), \(m_1\), and \(m_2\), and the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \(n\). If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutation.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The use of modular arithmetic is necessary to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
   - The modular inverse is used to compute binomial coefficients and other combinatorial values efficiently.

6. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to calculate the number of valid permutations by considering the constraints given by the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program uses the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function to compute the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the maximums.
   - The program iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to compute the product of the binomial coefficients and factorials, which gives the total number of valid permutations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does contain the main logic to solve the permutation problem. It correctly uses the helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` to handle modular arithmetic and combinatorial calculations. The program checks the necessary conditions and computes the number of valid permutations using the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem.

Final: **True**
