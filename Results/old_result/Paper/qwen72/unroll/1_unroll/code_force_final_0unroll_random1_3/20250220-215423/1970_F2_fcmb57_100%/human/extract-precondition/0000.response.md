Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams, respectively.** 

However, this precondition does not fully capture the complexity of the problem as described. A more accurate precondition for the function `func_1` based on the problem description would be:

Precondition: **N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99, representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field. P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10, representing the number of players in each team. T is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. The field is a list of N strings, each of length M, where each string consists of pairs of characters representing the entities on the field. The actions are a list of T strings, each describing a valid action performed by an entity.**
