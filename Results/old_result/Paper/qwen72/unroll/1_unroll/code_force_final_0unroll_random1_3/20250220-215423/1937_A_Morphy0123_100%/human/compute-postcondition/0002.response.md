Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the function has printed the position of 1 in the resulting array for each test case. The variable `n_cases` is unchanged, and the variable `i` is equal to `n_cases`. The variables `n` and `power` are undefined or reset after each iteration, so their final values are not meaningful.**
