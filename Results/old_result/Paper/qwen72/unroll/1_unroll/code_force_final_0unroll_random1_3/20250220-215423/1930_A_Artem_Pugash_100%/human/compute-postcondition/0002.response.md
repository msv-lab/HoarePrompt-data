The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. Each inner list in `cases` contains 2n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) representing the numbers written on the whiteboard.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines a specific output based on the numbers in the inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
