### Reasoning:

1. **Function and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the size of the grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1`, the function prints `1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if only one diagonal needs to be colored, the minimum number of cells to color is indeed `1`.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The function checks if `k` is less than or equal to `2 * (n + (n - 2))`. This expression simplifies to `2 * (2n - 2)`, which is `4n - 4`.
   - If `k` is within this range, the function prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals, so the minimum number of cells needed is `k / 2` rounded up.
   - If `k` is greater than `4n - 4`, the function prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is because if `k` exceeds `4n - 4`, the remaining diagonals can be covered by adding one more cell to the grid, which will cover the remaining diagonals.

4. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - For a grid of size `n x n`, there are `4n - 2` diagonals.
   - Each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals.
   - Therefore, to cover `k` diagonals, the minimum number of cells needed is `k / 2` rounded up, unless `k` exceeds `4n - 4`, in which case one additional cell is needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k == 1`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `k` is within the range `2` to `4n - 4`.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `k` exceeds `4n - 4`.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning and the checks in the function, the program appears to correctly handle all the described cases and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
