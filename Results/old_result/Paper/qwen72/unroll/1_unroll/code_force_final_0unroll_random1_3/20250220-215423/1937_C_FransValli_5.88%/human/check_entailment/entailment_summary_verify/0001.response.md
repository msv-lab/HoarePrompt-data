### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation `p` is maximized.
   - We can make at most `3n` queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the permutation.
   - The queries are of the form `? a b c d`, and the response is either `<`, `=`, or `>`.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The program uses a two-step approach to find the indices `i` and `j`:
     1. **Step 1**: Find an index `k` such that `p_k` is the maximum element in the permutation.
     2. **Step 2**: Find an index `best` such that `p_k \oplus p_best` is maximized.

3. **Step 1: Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The program initializes `k` to 1.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 2 to `n-1` and queries `? 0 k 0 i`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_k`, so `k` is updated to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `k` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

4. **Step 2: Finding the Best XOR Pair**:
   - The program initializes `best` to 0.
   - It iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and queries `? k best k i`.
   - If the response is `<`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate for maximizing the XOR with `p_k`, so `best` is updated to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `best` is the index of the element that, when XORed with `p_k`, gives the maximum value.

5. **Output the Result**:
   - After both steps, the program outputs `! k best`, which is the pair of indices with the maximum XOR value.

6. **Query Count**:
   - The first step makes `n-2` queries.
   - The second step makes `n-1` queries.
   - The total number of queries is `(n-2) + (n-1) = 2n - 3`, which is less than `3n` for all valid `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4).

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n = 2` correctly by directly outputting `! 0 1` without making any queries, as the only possible pair is `(0, 1)`.

8. **Correctness**:
   - **Step 1**: The program correctly identifies the maximum element in the permutation. This is because the bitwise OR of `p_0` and `p_k` will be less than the bitwise OR of `p_0` and `p_i` if `p_i` is greater than `p_k`.
   - **Step 2**: The program correctly identifies the best XOR pair. This is because the bitwise OR of `p_k` and `p_best` will be less than the bitwise OR of `p_k` and `p_i` if `p_i` is a better candidate for maximizing the XOR with `p_k`.
   - **Query Count**: The total number of queries is `2n - 3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.
   - **Interaction and Output Format**: The program handles the interaction and output format correctly, including flushing the output after each query and answer.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the maximum element and the best XOR pair, and it stays within the query limit. The interaction and output format are also handled correctly.

Final: **True**
