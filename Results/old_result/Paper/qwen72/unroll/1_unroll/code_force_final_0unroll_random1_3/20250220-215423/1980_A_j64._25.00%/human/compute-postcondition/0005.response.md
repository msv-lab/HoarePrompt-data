The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`.
