Output State: **`n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain the same positive integers such that `na + nb + nc = n`. `numbers` remains a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are now lists containing `na`, `nb`, and `nc` elements respectively, where the elements in `group_a` are the largest, followed by `group_b`, and then `group_c`. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are now the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively.**
