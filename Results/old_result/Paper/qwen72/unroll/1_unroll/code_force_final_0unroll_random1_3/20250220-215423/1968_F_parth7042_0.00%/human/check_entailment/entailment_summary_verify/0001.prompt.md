You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if there is a subarray whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function prints the results, with each test case's results separated by an empty line. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique to optimize input reading in competitive programming, especially when the input is large.
   - The program uses an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input list, which is incremented as values are read.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program processes each test case independently. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.

3. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - This is done using the formula `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.

4. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program maintains a dictionary `mp` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding segments with the same XOR value.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR value `x` is 0, it means the subarray can be split into segments with XOR 0, which is trivially interesting. The program appends "YES" to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect` module to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.
   - If such indices exist, the subarray is interesting, and the program appends "YES" to the results. Otherwise, it appends "NO".

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for a test case, the program appends an empty string to the results to separate the results of different test cases.
   - Finally, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of XOR Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated.
  - The XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` is correctly computed as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

- **Handling Trivial Case:**
  - If the XOR of the subarray is 0, the subarray is trivially interesting, and the program correctly handles this case.

- **Finding Segments with Same XOR:**
  - The program uses the `bisect` module to efficiently find indices where the prefix XOR values match the required conditions.
  - This approach is correct and efficient for the given constraints.

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions for the indices `l` and `r`.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. The use of the prefix XOR array and the `bisect` module ensures efficient and accurate results.

### Correctness:
**True**
