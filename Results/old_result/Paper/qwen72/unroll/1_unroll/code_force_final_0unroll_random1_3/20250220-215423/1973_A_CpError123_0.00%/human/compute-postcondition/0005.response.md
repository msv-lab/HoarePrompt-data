The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cas_de_test`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a list `resultats`, where each element is an integer representing the number of draws (ties) for the corresponding tuple in `cas_de_test`, or -1 if the conditions for calculating draws are not met.
