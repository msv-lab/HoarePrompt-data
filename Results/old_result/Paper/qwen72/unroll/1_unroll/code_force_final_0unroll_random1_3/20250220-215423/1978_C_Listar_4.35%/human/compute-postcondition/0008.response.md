The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. The function updates the values of `n` and `k` using the values returned by `func_2()`, but it does not return these values or any other values. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to update the values of `n` and `k` internally but does not return anything.

Functionality: **The function updates the values of `n` and `k` internally but does not return anything.**
