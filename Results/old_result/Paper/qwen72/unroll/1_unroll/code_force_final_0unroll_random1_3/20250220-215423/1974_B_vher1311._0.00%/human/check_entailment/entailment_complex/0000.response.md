Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Characters**: The program constructs a list of unique characters from the input string `s` and sorts it. However, the replacement logic inside the loop is flawed. The program replaces each character in the string `s` with the last character in the `unique_chars` list, which is not the correct way to decode the string. The correct decoding should replace each character in `s` with its symmetric character in the `unique_chars` list.

2. **Modification of `unique_chars`**: The program incorrectly modifies the `unique_chars` list by inserting characters at the beginning of the list. This is not part of the decoding algorithm and will lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Return Value**: The function `func_1` returns the `unique_chars` list as a string, which is not the intended output. The function should return the decoded string, not the list of unique characters.

4. **Logic for Decoding**: The correct decoding logic should involve creating a mapping from each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character. Then, each character in the input string `s` should be replaced using this mapping.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
