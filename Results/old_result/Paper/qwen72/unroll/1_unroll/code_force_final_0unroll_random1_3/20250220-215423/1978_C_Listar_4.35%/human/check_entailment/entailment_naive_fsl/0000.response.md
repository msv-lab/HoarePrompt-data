Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value `k`. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
5 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
Yes
2 1 3 4 5
```

### Actual Output:
```
No
```

### Explanation:
For the input `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the program should output a permutation of length 5 with a Manhattan value of 2. However, the program incorrectly outputs "No", indicating that no such permutation exists. This is a clear violation of the problem description, as a valid permutation does exist.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` and how it manipulates the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The function does not correctly handle the case where `k` is small and can be achieved by simple swaps or adjustments in the permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
