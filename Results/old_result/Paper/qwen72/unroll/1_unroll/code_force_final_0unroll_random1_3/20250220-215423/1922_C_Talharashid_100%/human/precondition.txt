t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities. a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order. m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries. Each query is a pair of integers x_i and y_i such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely.
