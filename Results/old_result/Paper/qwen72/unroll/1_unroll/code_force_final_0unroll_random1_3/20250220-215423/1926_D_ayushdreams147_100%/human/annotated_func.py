#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.

    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary containing the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function also maintains a dictionary `count` where the keys are the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1`, and the values are the counts of these complements. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a`. The dictionary `count` contains the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.
