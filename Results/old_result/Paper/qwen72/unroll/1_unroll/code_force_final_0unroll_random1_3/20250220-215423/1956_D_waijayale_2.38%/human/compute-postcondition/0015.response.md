Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a` from index `l` to index `r` inclusive. If `s` <= `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, the list `a` has been updated such that all elements from index `l` to index `r` inclusive are set to the value `r - l + 1`, `s` is now equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, and the tuple `(l, r)` has been appended to the list `ops`. If `s` > `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`.***
