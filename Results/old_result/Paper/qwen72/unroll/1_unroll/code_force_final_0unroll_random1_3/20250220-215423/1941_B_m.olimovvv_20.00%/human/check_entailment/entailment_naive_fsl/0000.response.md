Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
5
2 4 4 5 1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The program will output:

```
NO
NO
YES
```

However, the correct output should be:

```
YES
NO
YES
```

The first case is correct, but the second case should be "NO" as it is impossible to make all elements zero. The third case is also correct.

The issue lies in the logic used to determine if the array can be made all zeros. The program checks only the first and last elements to see if they can be reduced to zero, but it does not consider the entire array and the operations required to make all elements zero. Specifically, the program fails to check if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be reducible to all zeros using the given operation. Additionally, it does not verify if the elements in the array can be reduced to zero in a consistent manner. 

For example, the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]` cannot be reduced to all zeros because the sum of the elements (16) is divisible by 4, but the elements themselves cannot be reduced to zero in a consistent manner using the given operation. The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case.
