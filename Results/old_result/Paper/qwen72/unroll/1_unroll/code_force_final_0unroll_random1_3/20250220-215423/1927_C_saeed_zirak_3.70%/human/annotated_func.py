#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    #State: The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, but it has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated with new values for each iteration of the loop, and `a` and `b` are updated with new lists of integers for each iteration. The variables `aOnes` and `bOnes` are reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and are updated based on the loop logic. After the loop, `aOnes` and `bOnes` will either both be equal to `newk` (k // 2) and the output will be 'yes', or they will not be equal to `newk` and the output will be 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple sets of inputs, where each set includes integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by lists `a` and `b` of integers. For each set, it determines if it is possible to select `k // 2` elements from `a` and `k // 2` elements from `b` such that the selected elements are all distinct and are within the first `k` positive integers. If this condition is met, the function prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any values.
