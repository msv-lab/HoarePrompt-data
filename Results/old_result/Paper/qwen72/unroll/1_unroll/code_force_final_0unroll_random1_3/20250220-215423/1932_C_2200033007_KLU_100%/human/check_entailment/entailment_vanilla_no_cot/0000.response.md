Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly processes the commands as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as parameters.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that will be removed in the order of the commands.
   - It uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right boundaries of the array `a`.

3. **Processing Commands**:
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the current array to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the current array to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

4. **Calculating the Product Modulo**:
   - After processing all commands, the list `b` contains the elements in the order they were removed.
   - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product modulo `m`.
   - It iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element and the previous value of `p`, modulo `m`.
   - It appends the result of each product modulo `m` to the list `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the list `ans` in reverse order, which ensures that the results are in the correct order corresponding to the commands.

6. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The main loop prints the results of each test case by calling `func_1` and unpacking the returned list.

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the product is computed modulo `m` and the elements are removed in the specified order. Therefore, the program is correct.
