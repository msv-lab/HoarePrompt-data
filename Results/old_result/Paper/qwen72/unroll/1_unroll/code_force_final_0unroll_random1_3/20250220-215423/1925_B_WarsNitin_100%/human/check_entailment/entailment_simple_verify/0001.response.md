### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires breaking a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties of the sub-problems equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of the sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the difficulties of the sub-problems are all multiples of some integer \( d \), then \( d \) must divide \( x \) (i.e., \( x \) is a multiple of \( d \)).
   - Additionally, \( d \) must divide \( x - n \cdot d \) (i.e., \( x - n \cdot d \) must be non-negative and a multiple of \( d \)).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors \( i \) of \( x \) up to \( \sqrt{x} \).
   - For each divisor \( i \), it checks if \( x - n \cdot i \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( i \). If so, \( i \) is a valid candidate for the GCD.
   - It also checks if \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( x // i \). If so, \( x // i \) is another valid candidate for the GCD.
   - The maximum of these valid candidates is stored in `ans`.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( x \) and \( n \).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum balance for each test case, which is the maximum GCD found.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( n = 1 \) correctly, as the GCD of a single number is the number itself.
   - The program also handles the case where \( x \) is a prime number, as the only valid GCD in such cases would be 1.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to \( \sqrt{x} \), which is efficient for the given constraints \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Loop Over Divisors:**
  - The loop `for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1)` ensures that all divisors \( i \) of \( x \) are considered up to \( \sqrt{x} \). This is efficient because the number of divisors of \( x \) is at most \( 2 \cdot \sqrt{x} \).

- **Checking Divisors:**
  - The condition `if x % i == 0` ensures that \( i \) is a divisor of \( x \).
  - The condition `if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0` checks if \( x - n \cdot i \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( i \). If true, \( i \) is a valid candidate for the GCD.
  - The condition `if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` checks if \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \) is non-negative and a multiple of \( x // i \). If true, \( x // i \) is another valid candidate for the GCD.

- **Maximizing GCD:**
  - The program uses `ans = max(ans, i)` and `ans = max(ans, x // i)` to keep track of the maximum valid GCD found.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - When \( n = 1 \), the only valid GCD is \( x \) itself, which is correctly handled.
  - When \( x \) is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and \( x \). If \( n > 1 \), the GCD will be 1, which is correctly handled.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating over possible divisors and checking the conditions. It handles all edge cases and is efficient within the given constraints.
