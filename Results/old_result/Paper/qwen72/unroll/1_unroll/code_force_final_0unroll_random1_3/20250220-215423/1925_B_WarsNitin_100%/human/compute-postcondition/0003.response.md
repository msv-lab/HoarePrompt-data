Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from user input. The function then calculates and prints the largest integer divisor of `x` such that `(x - n * divisor)` is divisible by the divisor and non-negative. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^3, and `x` and `n` are unchanged for each test case. **
