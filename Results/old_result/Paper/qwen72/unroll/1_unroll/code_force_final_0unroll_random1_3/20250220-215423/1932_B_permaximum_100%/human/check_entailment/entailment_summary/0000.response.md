Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and calculates the year for each sign to occur, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially as described.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads the details of each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the function `func_1` initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the year in which the first sign is being waited for.

3. **Calculating the Next Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each sign's periodicity `ai`, the program checks if `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`.
   - If it is, the next year for the sign to occur is `current_year + ai`.
   - If it is not, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

4. **Updating the Current Year**: The `current_year` is updated to `next_year` for the next iteration, ensuring that the signs occur sequentially.

5. **Storing Results**: The final `current_year` for each test case is stored in the `results` list.

6. **Output**: The results are printed for each test case.

The logic correctly follows the problem's requirements:
- The signs occur sequentially.
- The year for the next sign is calculated based on the current year and the periodicity of the next sign.

The provided execution summary also aligns with the expected behavior of the program. The function `func_1` returns the correct year for each test case, and the input `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
