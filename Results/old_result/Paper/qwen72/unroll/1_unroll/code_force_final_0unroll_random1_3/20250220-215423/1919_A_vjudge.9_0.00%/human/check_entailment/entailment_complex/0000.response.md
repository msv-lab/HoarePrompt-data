Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because the wallet is empty) loses.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
     - If the sum `(a + b)` is even, Bob wins.
     - If the sum `(a + b)` is odd, Alice wins.
     - The reasoning behind this is that if the total number of coins is even, the players will always end up with an even number of moves, and Bob will have the last move. Conversely, if the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have the last move.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - In each turn, the player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will always end in an even number of moves, and Bob will have the last move. This is because each player will always have the same number of moves, and the game will end when the last coin is removed.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the game will always end in an odd number of moves, and Alice will have the last move. This is because Alice will always have one more move than Bob, and the game will end when the last coin is removed.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the user.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` from the user, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and stores the result in a list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results one by one.

5. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
