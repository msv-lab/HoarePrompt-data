Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the trace of a string s of length n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5), with each trace element a_i (0 \le a_i < n) being a non-negative integer. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, it should be corrected to match the problem description. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, traces):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and traces is a list of lists, where each inner list represents the trace of a string s of length n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5), with each trace element a_i (0 \le a_i < n) being a non-negative integer. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
