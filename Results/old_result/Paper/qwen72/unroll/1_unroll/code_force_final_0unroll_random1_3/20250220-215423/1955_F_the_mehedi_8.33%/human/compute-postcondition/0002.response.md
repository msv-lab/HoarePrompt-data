The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is expected to handle a sequence of four integers `p_i` where each `p_i` is an integer such that 0 <= p_i <= 200, and an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function should return a value based on these inputs, but the specific return conditions are not provided in the given information.
