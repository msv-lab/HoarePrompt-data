The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a new list `a` of `n` integers where `a[0]` is always 1000, and each subsequent element `a[i]` (for `1 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]`. The function prints the elements of the list `a` for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, a list `a` of `n` integers has been printed, where `a[0] = 1000` and `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for `1 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.
