The only objects in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `mex`. If `mex` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `itm` will be the first element of `mex` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is the same input integer, `arr` is the same list of integers input by the user, `mex` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` after processing all elements in `arr`, `used` is a dictionary containing all integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`, `itm` is the first element in `mex`**
