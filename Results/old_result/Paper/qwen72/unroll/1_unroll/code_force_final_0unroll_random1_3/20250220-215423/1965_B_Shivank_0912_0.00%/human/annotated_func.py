#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

    #State: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ k ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7. results is a list containing t elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). sequence is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., sequence = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]).
    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' containing 't' elements, where each element is a tuple (25, sequence). The 'sequence' list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(25, sequence)`. The `sequence` list contains 25 elements, each of which is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `cases`.
