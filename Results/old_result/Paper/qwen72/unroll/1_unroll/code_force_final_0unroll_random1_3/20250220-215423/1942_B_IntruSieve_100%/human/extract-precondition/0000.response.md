Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation p for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a` for each test case.
