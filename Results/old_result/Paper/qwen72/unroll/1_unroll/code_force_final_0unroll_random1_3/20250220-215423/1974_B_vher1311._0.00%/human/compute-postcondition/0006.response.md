Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string that contains all unique characters from `s` in their original order, followed by any characters from `s` that were not initially in the set of unique characters, inserted at the beginning of the list. The original string `s` is modified such that all characters are replaced by the last character in the `unique_chars` list, but this modification is not returned. **
