You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` distinct subsequences of the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that includes the first missing alphabet and the required number of 'a' characters to reach `n` distinct subsequences. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that does not occur as a subsequence.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and a string `s` of length `m`.
   - The output should be "YES" if all possible strings of length `n` occur as a subsequence, otherwise "NO" followed by a string of length `n` that does not occur.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in the string `s`.
   - It initializes `cnt` to count the number of valid subsequences and `cur` to track the current bitmask of characters seen.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in some order, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Bitmask Explanation:**
   - `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0` checks if the current character has not been seen before.
   - `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates the bitmask to include the current character.
   - `cur == (1 << k) - 1` checks if all `k` characters have been seen in some order.
   - `cnt` is incremented each time all `k` characters are seen in some order.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, the program finds the first character that has not been seen in the current bitmask `cur`.
   - It appends this character to the answer string `ans` and then appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to complete the string of length `n`.

6. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the missing subsequence.
   - The logic for constructing the missing subsequence is flawed. It only appends one missing character and then appends 'a' characters, which may not form a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The program should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` by ensuring it does not match any subsequence in `s`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the construction of the missing subsequence. It only appends one missing character and then appends 'a' characters, which may not form a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence. The logic for generating the missing subsequence needs to be more robust to ensure it does not match any subsequence in `s`.
