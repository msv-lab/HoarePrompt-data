Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by iterating over each test case and extracting the values `n`, `m`, and `a` from the tuple.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The program uses a list `freq` of size 7 to count the frequency of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`. This is done by converting each character to its corresponding index using `ord(prob) - ord('A')`.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the frequency of the current difficulty level. This expression ensures that if the frequency of a difficulty level is already greater than or equal to `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level. The sum of these values gives the total number of missing problems.

4. **Output**: The program appends the total number of missing problems to the `results` list and returns this list at the end. The results are then printed for each test case.

5. **Test Case Example**:
   - For the first test case `(10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED')`:
     - The frequencies are: `A: 0`, `B: 2`, `C: 2`, `D: 3`, `E: 1`, `F: 1`, `G: 1`.
     - The number of missing problems is `1 - 0 + 1 - 2 + 1 - 2 + 1 - 3 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 2`.
   - For the second test case `(10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED')`:
     - The frequencies are: `A: 0`, `B: 2`, `C: 2`, `D: 3`, `E: 1`, `F: 1`, `G: 1`.
     - The number of missing problems is `2 - 0 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 2 + 2 - 3 + 2 - 1 + 2 - 1 + 2 - 1 = 5`.
   - For the third test case `(9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG')`:
     - The frequencies are: `A: 0`, `B: 2`, `C: 1`, `D: 1`, `E: 1`, `F: 2`, `G: 2`.
     - The number of missing problems is `1 - 0 + 1 - 2 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 2 + 1 - 2 = 1`.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description and the execution summary.
