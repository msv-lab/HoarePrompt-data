#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, where each rating is between 1 and 10^9. It returns an integer value based on the following cases:
1. If there are no cows with a rating greater than the cow at index `k`, the function returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
2. If there is exactly one cow with a rating greater than the cow at index `k` and its index is 0, the function returns `k - 1`.
3. If there is exactly one cow with a rating greater than the cow at index `k` and its index is greater than `k`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.
4. If there is exactly one cow with a rating greater than the cow at index `k` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
5. If there are exactly two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index `k` and the first cow's index is 0, the function returns the minimum value between `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
6. If there are exactly two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index `k` and `k` is greater than the second cow's index, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
7. If there are exactly two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index `k` and `k` is less than or equal to the second cow's index, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

The list `a` remains unchanged, and the value of `x` (the rating of the cow at index `k`) also remains unchanged. If `k` is 14, the function may print the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two cows with ratings greater than the cow at index 14.
