Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it prints '12' to convert it to 12-hour format. This is correct.
   - If the hour `h` is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is. This is correct.
   - If the hour `h` is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints it with a leading zero if necessary (using `0{}` format). This is correct, but there is a potential issue with the format string. The format string `0{}` will always add a leading zero, even if the hour is a two-digit number (e.g., '13' becomes '01', '14' becomes '02', etc.). This is incorrect because the hour should be printed as a two-digit number without a leading zero if it is already a two-digit number.

3. **Minute Handling**: The function prints the minutes `s[2:]` as they are, which is correct.

4. **AM/PM Determination**: The function appends 'AM' if the hour `h` is less than 12, and 'PM' if the hour `h` is 12 or greater. This is correct.

5. **Output Format**: The function ensures that the output format is exactly as specified in the problem description, with the time and AM/PM separated by a space. However, due to the issue with the hour format, the output for hours between 13 and 23 will be incorrect.

Let's break down the function step by step to ensure it meets all the requirements:

- **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and the time strings.
- **Hour Conversion**:
  - For `00:00`, it correctly prints `12:00 AM`.
  - For `09:41`, it correctly prints `09:41 AM`.
  - For `18:06`, it incorrectly prints `06:06 PM` instead of `06:06 PM` (the hour should be `06` not `06`).
  - For `12:14`, it correctly prints `12:14 PM`.
  - For `21:37`, it incorrectly prints `09:37 PM` instead of `09:37 PM` (the hour should be `09` not `09`).

The issue lies in the format string used for hours between 13 and 23. The format string `0{}` always adds a leading zero, which is not necessary for two-digit hours. To fix this, we should use a format string that only adds a leading zero if the hour is a single digit.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('{:02d}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')  # Corrected format string
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

However, since we are evaluating the given program, we need to decide based on the provided code.

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issue with the hour format for times between 13:00 and 23:00. The format string `0{}` incorrectly adds a leading zero to two-digit hours, which does not meet the problem's requirements.
