Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")". It does not return a value but instead prints a string `result` which is a rearranged version of the input string `s` based on the balance of parentheses. The `result` string is formed by sorting the characters of `s` in a specific order (first by balance, then by position in reverse) and concatenating them. The function does not modify the input string `s`. **
