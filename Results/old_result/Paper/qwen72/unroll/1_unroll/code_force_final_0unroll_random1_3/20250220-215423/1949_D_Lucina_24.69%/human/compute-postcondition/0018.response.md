The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The variable `i` will start at 1, which is the first value in the range specified by the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `i` is not explicitly stated, but it will be set to 1 by the loop itself on the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is at least 1, and `i` will be 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
