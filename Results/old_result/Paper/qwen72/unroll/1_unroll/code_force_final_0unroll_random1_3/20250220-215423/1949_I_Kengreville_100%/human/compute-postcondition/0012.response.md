Output State: **`x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` depending on whether the corresponding index was visited or not, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `True` if at least one `dfs` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`, otherwise `ok` is `False`.**
