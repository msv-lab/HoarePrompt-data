Output State: **The program returns the list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving backwards.** 

In natural language, this means that the program returns a list where each element is the product of all the elements in `arr` from that position to the end of the list, calculated in reverse order. For example, if `arr` was `[2, 3, 4]`, then `ans` would be `[24, 8, 4]` because:
- The last element is 4, so the last element in `ans` is 4.
- The second-to-last element is 3, and the product of 3 and 4 is 12, but since we are moving backwards, it is 8 (3 * 4).
- The first element is 2, and the product of 2, 3, and 4 is 24.
