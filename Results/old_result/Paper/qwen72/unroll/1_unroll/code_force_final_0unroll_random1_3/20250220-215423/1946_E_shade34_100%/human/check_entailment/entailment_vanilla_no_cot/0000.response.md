Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to calculate the number of suitable permutations based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, they seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity, but this is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem, you would need to:

1. Identify the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.
2. Ensure that the largest number in the permutation is both a prefix and a suffix maximum.
3. Calculate the number of ways to arrange the remaining numbers such that the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are met.
4. Use combinatorial methods to count the valid permutations, and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The provided functions do not address these steps, and thus the program is incorrect for the given problem.
