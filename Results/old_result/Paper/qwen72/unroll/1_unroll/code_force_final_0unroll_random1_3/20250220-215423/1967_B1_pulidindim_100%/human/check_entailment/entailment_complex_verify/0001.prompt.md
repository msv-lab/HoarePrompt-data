You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `ans` for each iteration of the outer loop, where `ans` is calculated based on the input values of `n` and `m` for each iteration. The values of `n` and `m` will be updated from the input for each iteration of the outer loop, and `count` will be reset to 2 for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a loop, and prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `n` and `m` are no longer relevant, and the variable `t` will have been decremented to 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observation**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it must be that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which implies \(a = (k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b)\).
   - This can be further simplified to \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).

3. **Initial Count**:
   - The program starts by initializing `ans` to `n`. This is because for \(b = 1\), \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\). Therefore, all pairs \((a, 1)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) are valid, contributing `n` valid pairs.

4. **Loop for \(b > 1\)**:
   - The program then iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates `countmins` as \(b - 1\).
   - It calculates `g` as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\), which is the maximum integer \(a\) such that \(a \le n\) and \(a\) is a multiple of \(b\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop because no valid pairs can be found for this \(b\).
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid pairs for the current \(b\) using the formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (b - 1)}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\) and adds this to `ans`.

5. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The formula \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (b - 1)}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\).
   - \(g - (b - 1)\) gives the range of \(a\) values that are multiples of \(b\) and greater than or equal to \(b\).
   - Dividing this range by \(b\) and adding 1 gives the number of valid \(a\) values.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final count `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the case where \(b = 1\), contributing `n` valid pairs.
- The loop for \(b > 1\) correctly iterates and calculates the number of valid pairs for each \(b\).
- The formula used to count valid pairs for each \(b\) is mathematically sound and correctly implemented.

However, there is a potential issue with the initial count being set to `n` and then incremented. This might lead to overcounting if the pairs are not correctly handled. Let's verify the logic with the provided example:

### Example Verification:
- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - Initial count: `ans = 10` (pairs: (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1)).
  - For \(b = 2\):
    - `countmins = 1`
    - `g = 5` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{2} \right\rfloor = 5\))
    - Valid pairs: (2,2), (4,2), (6,2), (8,2), (10,2)
    - Contribution: 5
  - For \(b = 3\):
    - `countmins = 2`
    - `g = 3` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{3} \right\rfloor = 3\))
    - Valid pairs: (3,3), (6,3), (9,3)
    - Contribution: 3
  - For \(b = 4\):
    - `countmins = 3`
    - `g = 2` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{4} \right\rfloor = 2\))
    - Valid pairs: (4,4), (8,4)
    - Contribution: 2
  - For \(b = 5\):
    - `countmins = 4`
    - `g = 2` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{5} \right\rfloor = 2\))
    - Valid pairs: (5,5), (10,5)
    - Contribution: 2
  - For \(b = 6\):
    - `countmins = 5`
    - `g = 1` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{6} \right\rfloor = 1\))
    - Valid pairs: (6,6)
    - Contribution: 1
  - For \(b = 7\):
    - `countmins = 6`
    - `g = 1` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{7} \right\rfloor = 1\))
    - Valid pairs: (7,7)
    - Contribution: 1
  - For \(b = 8\):
    - `countmins = 7`
    - `g = 1` (since \(\left\lfloor \frac{10}{8} \right\rfloor = 1\))
    - Valid pairs: (8,8)
    - Contribution: 1

Summing up all contributions: \(10 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25\).

However, the correct output for \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\) is 14, not 25. This indicates that the program is overcounting pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to overcounting valid pairs.
