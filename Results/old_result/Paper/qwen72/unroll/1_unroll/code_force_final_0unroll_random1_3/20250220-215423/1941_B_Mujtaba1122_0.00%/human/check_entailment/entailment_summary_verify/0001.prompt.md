You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It modifies the list such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i - 1]` is set to 0, `list[i]` is reduced by `2 * list[i - 1]` (which is 2 times its original value before being set to 0), and `list[i + 1]` is reduced by `list[i - 1]` (which is its original value before being set to 0). This process continues for each `i` until either `list[i]` is no longer greater than 1, or `list[i - 1]` or `list[i + 1]` is no longer greater than 0. The first and last elements of the list, `list[0]` and `list[n - 1]`, are not modified. After the list is processed, the function calls `func_1(list, n)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose well.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \), \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, the implementation of the operation is incorrect. The lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     This is because the operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of \( a_{i-1} \).

4. **Correctness of the Operation**:
   - The operation should be applied in a way that ensures the array can be reduced to all zeros if possible.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` will not work correctly because it incorrectly modifies the array elements by multiples of \( a_{i-1} \).

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The problem requires that the sum of the elements in the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4.
   - The current implementation does not check this condition, which is a necessary step to determine the feasibility of making all elements zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2` and the lack of a necessary condition check. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
    if sum(list) % 4 != 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Apply the operation to try to make all elements zero
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

for n, list in test_cases:
    func_2(list, n)
```

This corrected version includes the necessary sum check and correctly applies the operation.
