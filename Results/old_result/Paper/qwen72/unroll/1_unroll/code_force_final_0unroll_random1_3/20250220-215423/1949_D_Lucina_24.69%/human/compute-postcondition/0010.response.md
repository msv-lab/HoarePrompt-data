Postcondition: **`sa` contains the row indices where there is at least one 'F' transition and no 'S' transitions, and `sb` contains the column indices where there is at least one 'S' transition and no 'F' transitions. The values of `n` and `xx` remain unchanged. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`.**
