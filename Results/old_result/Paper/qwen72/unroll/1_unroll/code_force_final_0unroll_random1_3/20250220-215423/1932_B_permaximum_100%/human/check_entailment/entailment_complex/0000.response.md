Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs and the requirement that each sign must occur strictly after the previous one. Let's break down the logic of the program to see if it meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, storing the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` for each test case in a list `test_cases`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates over each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.
     - It updates `current_year` to `next_year`.
   - Finally, it appends `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints each result in the `results` list, which is the year in which the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The function correctly calculates the next year for each sign to occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- The calculation `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
- The function correctly handles the sequential nature of the signs, as required by the problem.

### Example Verification:
- For the test case `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs in year 4 (since 3 is not a multiple of 2, the next multiple is 4).
  - The third sign occurs in year 8 (since 4 is not a multiple of 4, the next multiple is 8).
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 10 (since 8 is not a multiple of 5, the next multiple is 10).
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 18 (since 10 is not a multiple of 9, the next multiple is 18).
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 36 (since 18 is not a multiple of 18, the next multiple is 36).

- For the test case `1 2 3 4 5`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 1.
  - The second sign occurs in year 2.
  - The third sign occurs in year 3.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.

- For the test case `1 1 1 1 1`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 1.
  - The second sign occurs in year 2.
  - The third sign occurs in year 3.
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.

- For the test case `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
  - The first sign occurs in year 50.
  - The second sign occurs in year 60 (since 50 is not a multiple of 30, the next multiple is 60).
  - The third sign occurs in year 711 (since 60 is not a multiple of 711, the next multiple is 711).
  - The fourth sign occurs in year 800 (since 711 is not a multiple of 200, the next multiple is 800).
  - The fifth sign occurs in year 1006 (since 800 is not a multiple of 503, the next multiple is 1006).
  - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012 (since 1006 is not a multiple of 1006, the next multiple is 2012).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The function `func_1` and the overall program structure are correct and produce the expected results for the given examples.
