The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of a ribbon, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. The function then prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program is such that all test cases have been handled and the corresponding counts of free cells have been printed.
