t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Each of the two strings representing the rows of the grid consists of exactly n characters, which are either '<' or '>', indicating the direction of the arrows in the cells.
