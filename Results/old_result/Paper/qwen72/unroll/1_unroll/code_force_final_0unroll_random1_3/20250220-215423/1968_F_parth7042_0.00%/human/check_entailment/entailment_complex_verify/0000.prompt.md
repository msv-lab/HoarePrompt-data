You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Each `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #[result of test case 1]
    #[empty line]
    #...
    #[result of test case (m-1)]
    #[empty line]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if there is a subarray whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function prints the results, with each test case's results separated by an empty line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it checks for the possibility of splitting the subarray into parts with equal XOR values. Specifically, the logic in the following lines is flawed:

```python
v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):
    results.append('YES')
else:
    results.append('NO')
```

The program attempts to find indices where the prefix XOR values match the XOR of the subarray, but it does not correctly handle the case where the subarray can be split into multiple parts with the same XOR value. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```

The subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` can be split into parts with equal XOR values, such as `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5]` where `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0` and `4 ^ 5 = 1`, but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly check for the possibility of such a split.

This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
