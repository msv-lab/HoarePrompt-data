### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Operation:**
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the values at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - This operation is designed to reduce the values in the array, and the goal is to determine if it is possible to reduce all elements to zero.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( a \).

3. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array from the start to the second-to-last element (i.e., \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n-3 \)).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it performs the operation by decrementing \( a[i] \), \( a[i+1] \), and \( a[i+2] \) by \( a[i] \), \( 2 \times a[i] \), and \( a[i] \) respectively.
   - This step is designed to simulate the operation and check if the array can be reduced to zero.

4. **Early Termination:**
   - If at any point \( a[i] \) is negative, the program prints "NO" and stops processing the current test case. This is because negative values are not allowed in the array, and the operation cannot be applied to negative values.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array \( a[n-2] \) and \( a[n-1] \) are zero.
   - If either of these elements is non-zero, the program prints "NO".
   - If both are zero, the program prints "YES".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array has fewer than 3 elements by the loop condition \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n-3 \).
   - The program also handles the case where the array elements are already zero by the final check.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the operation and checks if the array can be reduced to zero.
   - However, there is a potential issue: the program does not handle the case where the operation might make \( a[i+1] \) or \( a[i+2] \) negative. This can lead to incorrect results if the operation is applied in a way that makes subsequent elements negative.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct because it does not handle the case where the operation might make \( a[i+1] \) or \( a[i+2] \) negative. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Example of Incorrectness:
- Consider the array `[1, 2, 1]`:
  - After the first operation at \( i=0 \), the array becomes `[0, 0, 0]`.
  - However, if the array is `[1, 2, 0]`, the operation at \( i=0 \) would make the array `[0, 0, -1]`, which is invalid.

### Correctness: **False**
