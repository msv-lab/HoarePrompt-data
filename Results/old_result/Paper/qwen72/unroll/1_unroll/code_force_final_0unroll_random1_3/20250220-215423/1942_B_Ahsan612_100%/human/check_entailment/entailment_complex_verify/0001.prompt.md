You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs a list `res` of length `n` where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller. The final state of `res` is printed as a space-separated string for each test case. The variables `t` and `n` are consumed by the loop, and the list `a` is transformed into the output `res` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of the same length `n`, where each element `res[i]` is calculated as `mex - ar[i]`, and `mex` is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller. The function then prints the list `res` as a space-separated string for each test case. The variables `t` and `n` are consumed, and the list `a` is transformed into the output `res` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` such that for each `i`, `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - We need to determine the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.
   - The key insight is to work backwards from the end of the array `a` to the beginning. This is because the MEX of the entire permutation `p` is `n` (since `p` is a permutation of `0` to `n-1`).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `mex` to `n` (the MEX of the full permutation).
   - Iterate from the last element of `a` to the first.
   - For each `i`, calculate `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to `mex - a[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - a[i]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` by ensuring that `p[i]` is the value that satisfies the given condition `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The update of `mex` ensures that the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` is correctly maintained.
   - The algorithm handles the constraints and guarantees that the output is a valid permutation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm works for the smallest possible `n` (i.e., `n = 1`).
   - The algorithm also works for larger `n` and multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - For the input `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - For the input `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the algorithm correctly outputs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
