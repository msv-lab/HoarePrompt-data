Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the lengths of two arrays `a` and `b`, the required number of matching elements `k`, and the arrays themselves. It then counts the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements match elements in `b` and have not been counted more than once. The function prints the count of such valid subarrays for each test case. After processing all test cases, `cnt_b` is reset to a list of 1000001 zeros, `max_val` remains 1000000, and no value is returned. **
