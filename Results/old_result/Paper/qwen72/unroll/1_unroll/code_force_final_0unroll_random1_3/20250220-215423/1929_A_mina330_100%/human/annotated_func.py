#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an array of integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` have been modified as follows: `ntest` remains unchanged, `itest` is equal to `ntest`, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last sorted list of integers read. The function has printed the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each array for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array, then reads `n` integers into a list `a`. It sorts the list `a` and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the difference for each test case, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` are in the final state described in the comments. The function does not return any value.
