You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
            L.append(m)
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1))
            tot += a
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function then calculates a sequence of values based on `n` and `k`, and prints a specific value derived from these calculations for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the appropriate values have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Laying Down Cards**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `L` to keep track of the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly calculate the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step. The number of cards `m` that can be laid down in the current step is given by `(n + 1) // 2`, which is the number of odd-numbered cards up to `n`.
   - It then subtracts `m` from `n` to update the remaining number of cards.
   - The value `m` is appended to the list `L`.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - The program initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1. `tot` keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down so far, and `pow` is used to determine the multiplier for the current step.
   - It iterates over the list `L` to find the step where the k-th card is laid down.
   - For each step, it checks if `k` falls within the range of cards laid down in that step (`tot < k and k <= tot + a`).
   - If `k` is within the range, it prints the k-th card, which is calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - It then updates `tot` by adding the number of cards laid down in the current step and multiplies `pow` by 2 to move to the next step.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will lay down the card 1 first.
   - For larger `n`, it correctly calculates the number of cards laid down in each step and finds the k-th card.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given in the problem description, as it only uses a while loop and a for loop, both of which have a time complexity that is manageable within the given limits.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly follows the described process of laying down the cards.
   - It correctly identifies the k-th card by accumulating the number of cards laid down in each step and using the appropriate formula to calculate the card number.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
