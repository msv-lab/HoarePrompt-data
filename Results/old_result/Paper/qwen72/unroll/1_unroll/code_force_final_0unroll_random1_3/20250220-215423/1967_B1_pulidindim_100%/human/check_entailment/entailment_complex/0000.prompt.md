Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The loop will print the value of `ans` for each iteration of the outer loop, where `ans` is calculated based on the input values of `n` and `m` for each iteration. The values of `n` and `m` will be updated from the input for each iteration of the outer loop, and `count` will be reset to 2 for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` using a loop, and prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `n` and `m` are no longer relevant, and the variable `t` will have been decremented to 0.
