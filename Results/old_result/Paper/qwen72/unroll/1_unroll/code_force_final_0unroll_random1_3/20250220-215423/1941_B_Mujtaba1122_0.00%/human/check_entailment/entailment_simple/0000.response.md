Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `lst`.
   - It then calls `func_2(lst, n)` to determine if the array can be made all zeros.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the list zero using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the elements from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., the middle elements of the list).
   - For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i < n - 1`, it enters a while loop if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0.
   - Inside the while loop, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - This operation is incorrect because it subtracts `list[i - 1]` from `list[i - 1]`, `2 * list[i - 1]` from `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` from `list[i + 1]`. This means that `list[i - 1]` is being set to zero, and the other elements are being reduced by values that are not consistent with the problem description.

4. **Correct Operation**:
   - According to the problem, the operation should be:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - The current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect because it uses `list[i - 1]` as the decrement value, which is not what the problem specifies.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should decrement `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, as long as `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0.

6. **Final Check**:
   - After attempting to perform the operations, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the incorrect operation in `func_2`, the program will not correctly determine if the array can be made all zeros.

Correctness: **False**
