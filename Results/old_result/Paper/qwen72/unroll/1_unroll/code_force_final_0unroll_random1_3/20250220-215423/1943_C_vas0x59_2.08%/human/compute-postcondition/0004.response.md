Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node (0-indexed), and each connection is bidirectional. `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph represented by `u2vs`.**

Explanation: The `bfs` function is called with the starting node `0`. This function performs a breadth-first search on the graph represented by `u2vs` and returns two values, where the first value `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph. The second value returned by `bfs` is ignored. The structure and content of `u2vs` remain unchanged.
