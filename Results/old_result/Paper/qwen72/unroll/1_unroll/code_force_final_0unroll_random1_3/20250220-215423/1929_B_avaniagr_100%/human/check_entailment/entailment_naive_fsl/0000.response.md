Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k = 4n - 4 \) correctly. According to the problem description, the grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. The program's logic for \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) is to print \( \text{math.ceil}(k / 2) \), but this does not always ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

For example, consider the input \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \). The program will output \( \text{math.ceil}(4 / 2) = 2 \). However, with only 2 colored cells, it is not possible to ensure that 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The minimum number of cells required to ensure 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell is 3, not 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
