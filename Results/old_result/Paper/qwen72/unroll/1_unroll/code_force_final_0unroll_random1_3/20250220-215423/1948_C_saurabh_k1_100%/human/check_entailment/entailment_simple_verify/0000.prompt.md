You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly n characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. t must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n is even, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the list of integers `n` and the list of tuples containing the strings of arrows for each test case remain unchanged. The loop prints 'No' or 'yes' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it prints 'No' if there is a position `i` (where `i` is odd) such that either `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, and 'yes' otherwise.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not consider the possibility that the robot can move up or down after moving left or right. The program only checks for specific conditions where the robot might get stuck, but it does not fully simulate the robot's movement to ensure it can reach the target cell (2, n).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```
The correct output should be "YES" because the robot can follow this path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (2, 2) → (2, 3) → (1, 3) → (1, 4) → (2, 4). However, the program will output "No" because it only checks for specific conditions and does not simulate the entire movement process.

This input demonstrates a case where the program does not work as expected, hence the program is incorrect.
