You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an array of integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        print(a[len(a) - 1] - a[0])
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` have been modified as follows: `ntest` remains unchanged, `itest` is equal to `ntest`, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last sorted list of integers read. The function has printed the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each array for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`). However, the problem requires calculating the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the problem statement. However, the provided program will output `2` because it calculates `3 - 1`, which is correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

Consider another input:
```
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be `1`, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`. The provided program will output `1` because it calculates `4 - 3`, which is correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

However, for the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The correct output should be `57`, which can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` or `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]`. The provided program will output `57` because it calculates `100 - 43`, which is correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

The issue is that the program does not actually calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` after rearranging the array. Instead, it only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the same as the required sum of differences.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        beauty = sum(a[i] - a[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)
```

This version sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.
