Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` is now 0, as the loop has run `t` times. The variables `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` are no longer in scope, as they are defined within the loop and are reset for each test case. The output for each test case is printed as 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked within the loop.**
