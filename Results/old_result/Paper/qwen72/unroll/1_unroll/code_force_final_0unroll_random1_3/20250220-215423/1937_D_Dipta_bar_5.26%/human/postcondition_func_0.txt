The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It processes the string to compute and print a series of integers. Each integer represents a specific calculation based on the positions and counts of '<' and '>' characters in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` are populated with intermediate values used in the calculations. The final state of the program includes the printed output and the populated lists, but the original string `s` is not modified.
