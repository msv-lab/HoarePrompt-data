The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, the loop will execute if the number of test cases `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is not something we need to adjust since it is just a placeholder and will be automatically managed by the loop. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4, `_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
