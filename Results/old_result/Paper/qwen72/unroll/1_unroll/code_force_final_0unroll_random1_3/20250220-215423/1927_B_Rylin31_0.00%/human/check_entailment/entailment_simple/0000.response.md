### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**:
   - The function initializes a list `alp` containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. This is correct because the string `s` should consist only of these letters.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The function reverses the trace array `array` to `rev_array`. This is a key step in the logic, as it allows the function to build the string from the end to the beginning, which simplifies the counting of occurrences.

4. **Building the Answer**:
   - The function iterates over the length `l` and for each index `j`, it appends to `ans` the letter from `alp` corresponding to the count of `rev_array[j]` in the subarray `rev_array[j:]` minus one.
   - The `-1` is necessary because the trace array `a_i` is 0-indexed, meaning `a_i = 0` indicates the first occurrence, `a_i = 1` indicates the second occurrence, and so on.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Trace Array Interpretation**:
  - The trace array `a_i` indicates how many times the character at position `i` has appeared before in the string.
  - By reversing the array, the function can start from the end and work backwards, ensuring that the count of occurrences is correct for each character.

- **Counting Occurrences**:
  - The expression `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of `rev_array[j]` in the subarray starting from `j` to the end, and then subtracts one to get the correct index in the alphabet list `alp`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the edge case where `l = 1` correctly, as it will simply append the first letter 'a' to `ans`.
  - The function also handles the case where all elements in the trace array are zero, which corresponds to a string where all characters are unique.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly reconstructs a string `s` from the given trace array for each test case. The logic is sound and the implementation matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
