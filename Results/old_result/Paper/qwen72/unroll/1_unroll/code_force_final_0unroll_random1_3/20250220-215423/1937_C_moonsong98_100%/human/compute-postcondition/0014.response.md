Output State: **`max_index` remains `n-1`, `min_indices` remains unchanged, `min_index` remains the last index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index` and for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='`. If no such index exists, `min_index` remains `min_indices[0]`. `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called.**

Explanation:
- `max_index` remains `n-1`.
- `min_indices` remains unchanged.
- `min_index` remains the last index in `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index` and for which `func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)` returns `'='`. If no such index exists, `min_index` remains `min_indices[0]`.
- `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called, but since the function `func_2` is not defined, we cannot determine its specific impact on the state. However, it has been executed with the given arguments.
