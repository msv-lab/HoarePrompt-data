Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Bitmasking Logic**: The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, it does not correctly handle the formation of all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The bitmask `cur` is reset to 0 after each full set of `k` characters is found, which does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.

2. **Subsequence Checking**: The program does not check if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present in the string `s`. Instead, it only counts the number of times a full set of `k` characters is found in `s` and prints `YES` if this count is greater than or equal to `n`. This is not the correct approach to determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: When the program prints `NO`, it attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending a character that is not in the current bitmask `cur` and then appending `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters. This does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, print `NO` and the missing string. If all possible strings are subsequences, print `YES`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
        all_possible = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        # Check if each possible string is a subsequence of s
        for possible in all_possible:
            if not is_subsequence(possible, s):
                print('NO')
                print(possible)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected version uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s` using the `is_subsequence` function. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints `NO` and the missing string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints `YES`.
