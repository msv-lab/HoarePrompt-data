Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints two lines. The first line is the lexicographically largest number that can be formed by replacing the digits of the first number (x) with the maximum of the corresponding digits of x and y until the first differing digit, and then with the minimum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The second line is the lexicographically smallest number that can be formed by replacing the digits of the first number (x) with the minimum of the corresponding digits of x and y until the first differing digit, and then with the maximum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The variables t, x, and y remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two numbers `x` and `y` (represented as lists of digits), and prints two lines. The first line is the lexicographically largest number formed by replacing the digits of `x` with the maximum of the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` until the first differing digit, and then with the minimum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The second line is the lexicographically smallest number formed by replacing the digits of `x` with the minimum of the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` until the first differing digit, and then with the maximum of the corresponding digits for the rest of the digits. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
