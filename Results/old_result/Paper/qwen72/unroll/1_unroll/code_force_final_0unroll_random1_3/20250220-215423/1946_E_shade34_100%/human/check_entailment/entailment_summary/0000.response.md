### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of different permutations of length `n` that could have been guessed, given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum in the prefix ending at that element.
   - The suffix maximums are the elements that are the maximum in the suffix starting at that element.
   - The answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is a recursive implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - The function returns a tuple `(c, d)` such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \text{gcd}(a, b)\).
   - The function is used to find the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1` and then returns the result of \(a \cdot \text{modular\_inverse}(b) \mod 10^9 + 7\).
   - This is used to perform modular division, which is necessary for calculating combinations in modular arithmetic.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutation.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of valid permutations using the indices of the suffix maximums and prefix maximums.
   - The calculation involves using combinations to determine the number of ways to place elements in the gaps between the maximums, and then multiplying these combinations together.
   - The result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The combination \( \binom{n}{k} \) is calculated using the formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \).
   - The modular inverse of the denominator is calculated using `func_2` to avoid division in modular arithmetic.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the conditions for the indices of the maximums are not met.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the permutation length `n` is 1.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The use of modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for modular inverse is appropriate and correctly applied.
- The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
