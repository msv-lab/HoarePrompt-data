Output State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user, `n` is a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. `t` must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each `n` must satisfy 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` is even, and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
