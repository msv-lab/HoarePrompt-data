You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The list `ratings` contains `n` distinct integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= n`. The integer `k` is the index (1-based) of your cow in the list `ratings`. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s[0], s[k - 1] = s[k - 1], s[0]

        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1

        print(max(ans, ans1))
        
    #State: The loop will execute for `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will print the maximum number of cows that can be placed before your cow (at index `k`) in the list `ratings` such that all these cows have a rating less than or equal to your cow's rating. The list `ratings` and the index `k` will not be modified after the loop execution.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal swap position is not the first or the position where the first loss occurs. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5 3
10 15 20 25 30
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

In this test case, the optimal strategy would be to swap the cow with rating 20 (position 3) to position 2, so the sequence becomes:
```
10 20 15 25 30
```

The matches would proceed as follows:
1. Cow 20 (initially at position 2) wins against cow 10.
2. Cow 20 wins against cow 15.
3. Cow 20 loses to cow 25.

Thus, the maximum number of wins cow 3 can achieve is 2. However, the program only considers swapping the cow to the first position or the position where the first loss occurs, leading to an incorrect result.
