You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:

    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a`, `count` is a dictionary containing the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a`. The function also maintains a dictionary `count` where the keys are the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1`, and the values are the counts of these complements. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, and `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a`. The dictionary `count` contains the XOR complements of the unique integers in `a` with `(1 << 31) - 1` as keys, and their values are all 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the requirement that in any group, any pair of numbers should not have matching bit values among the 31 least significant bits. The program attempts to use a dictionary to count the complements of the numbers, but this approach is flawed for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Grouping**: The program checks if the complement of a number (i.e., `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num`) is already in the dictionary. If it is not, it adds the number to the dictionary and increments the result. If the complement is already in the dictionary, it decrements the count of the number in the dictionary and removes it if the count reaches zero. This logic does not ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.

2. **Handling of Duplicates**: The program does not correctly handle duplicate numbers. For example, if the input contains multiple identical numbers, the program will incorrectly group them together, violating the condition that no two numbers in the same group should have matching bits.

3. **Bitwise Operation**: The bitwise operation `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` is used to get the complement of the number, but this is not the correct way to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits. The correct approach would be to consider the 31 least significant bits of each number and ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit pattern in these positions.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
The 31 least significant bits of these numbers are:
- `1` in binary: `000...0001`
- `2` in binary: `000...0010`
- `3` in binary: `000...0011`

According to the problem description, these numbers should be grouped such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits. However, the program will incorrectly group `1` and `2` together, and `3` in a separate group, because it does not correctly handle the bitwise comparison.

The correct output for this case should be `2` (since `1` and `2` can be in one group, and `3` in another), but the program will output `3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
