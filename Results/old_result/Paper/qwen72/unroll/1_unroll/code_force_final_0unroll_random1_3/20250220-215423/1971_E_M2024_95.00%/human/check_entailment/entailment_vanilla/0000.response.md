### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points.
   - It initializes `ad` and `bd` lists to store the distances and time differences between consecutive known points.
   - It initializes `v` to store the speeds between consecutive known points.

2. **Speed Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the distances between consecutive points and stores them in `ad`.
   - It correctly calculates the time differences between consecutive points and stores them in `bd`.
   - It calculates the speeds between consecutive points and stores them in `v`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` of the first known point that is greater than or equal to the query point `ql`.
   - If the query point `ql` is exactly at a known point `a[s]`, it directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - If the query point `ql` is not at a known point, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the distance to the previous known point `a[s-1]` from `ql`.
     - Adding the time to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]` to the time it takes to travel the remaining distance at the speed between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing in `bisect_left`:**
  - The program uses `bisect_left` on the list `a` which includes the initial point 0. This is correct because `a` is strictly increasing and includes 0.
  - However, the program should ensure that `s` is within the bounds of the lists `a` and `b`.

- **Speed Calculation:**
  - The speed calculation `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` is correct, but it should be noted that `ad[i]` and `bd[i]` are the differences between consecutive points, not the points themselves.

- **Time Calculation:**
  - The time calculation `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` is correct, but it should be noted that `ql` is adjusted to the remaining distance after subtracting `a[s-1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly parses the input, calculates the speeds, and processes the queries to output the time taken to reach each query point, rounded down to the nearest integer.
