Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. One issue is in the `func_2` function where the operation is being applied incorrectly. Specifically, the line:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
```

This logic is flawed because it is decrementing `list[i - 1]` by itself, which is not the intended operation. The operation should decrement `list[i - 1]` by 1, `list[i]` by 2, and `list[i + 1]` by 1. The correct implementation should be:

```python
list[i - 1] -= 1
list[i] -= 2
list[i + 1] -= 1
```

Additionally, the program does not check if the array can be made all zeros in a more efficient way. For example, the program does not handle cases where the sum of the elements is not divisible by 4, which is a necessary condition for the array to be made all zeros.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly apply the operations and does not handle the necessary conditions for the array to be made all zeros.
