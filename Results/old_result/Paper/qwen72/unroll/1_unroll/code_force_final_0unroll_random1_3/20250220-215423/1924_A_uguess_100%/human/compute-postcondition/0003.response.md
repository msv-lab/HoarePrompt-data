The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, representing a constraint related to the alphabet. `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, representing the number of distinct lowercase English alphabets used. `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 1000, representing the length of the string `s`. `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The sum of `m` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns different outputs based on the input:
- Case_1: If `t` is 1, the function processes a single test case and returns a result based on the input `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`.
- Case_2: If `t` is greater than 1, the function processes multiple test cases and returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are constraints related to the alphabet, `m` is the length of the string `s`, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If `t` is 1, it returns a result for a single test case. If `t` is greater than 1, it returns a list of results for multiple test cases.**
