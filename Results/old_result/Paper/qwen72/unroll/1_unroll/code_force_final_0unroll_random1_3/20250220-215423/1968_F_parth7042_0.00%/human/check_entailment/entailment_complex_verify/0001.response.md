### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is indeed a common and efficient technique in competitive programming, especially for large inputs.
   - The program uses an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input list, which is incremented as values are read. This approach is correct and ensures that the input is processed efficiently.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program processes each test case independently. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`. This is done correctly and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program constructs a prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This is done using the formula `pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]`.
   - This is a correct and efficient way to compute the prefix XOR array, which is essential for quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray.

4. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program maintains a dictionary `mp` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This helps in quickly finding segments with the same XOR value, which is crucial for determining if the subarray is interesting.
   - The initialization of `mp` with `{0: [0]}` is correct because the prefix XOR of an empty subarray is 0, and it starts at index 0.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If the XOR value `x` is 0, it means the subarray can be split into segments with XOR 0, which is trivially interesting. The program appends "YES" to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect` module to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.
   - The use of `bisect.bisect_left` to find the appropriate indices is correct and ensures that the program efficiently checks for the existence of such indices.
   - The conditions `it1 < len(v1)` and `it2 >= 0` and `v1[it1] <= r` and `v2[it2] >= l` are correctly used to ensure that the indices fall within the required range.

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for a test case, the program appends an empty string to the results to separate the results of different test cases.
   - Finally, the program prints the results, each on a new line, with the results of different test cases separated by an empty line. This aligns with the output format specified in the problem description.
