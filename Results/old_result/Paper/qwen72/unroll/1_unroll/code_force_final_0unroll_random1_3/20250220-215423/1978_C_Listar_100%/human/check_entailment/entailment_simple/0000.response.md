### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_6()` for each one. This is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It checks if `k` is even. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists. This is correct because the Manhattan value of any permutation is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`. For odd `n`, `max_k` is \((n^2 - 1) // 2\), and for even `n`, `max_k` is \(n^2 // 2\). This is correct based on the properties of permutations.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists. This is correct because the Manhattan value cannot exceed the maximum possible value for a given `n`.
   - If `k` is within the valid range, it returns `n` and `k`. This is correct and ensures that the values are passed to the next function.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It iterates over the list in reverse order, swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The loop updates `k` and `c` to keep track of the remaining Manhattan value to achieve and the current position in the list.
   - If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`, indicating that the desired Manhattan value has been achieved.
   - If `k` is less than the current index difference, it calls `func_2` to perform a specific swap.
   - If the loop completes, it returns the final list `l`. This is correct and ensures that the list is modified to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function performs a specific swap in the list `l` to reduce the remaining Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.
   - It returns the modified list `l`. This is correct and ensures that the list is modified to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function performs a specific swap in the list `l` to reduce the remaining Manhattan value.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - It returns the modified list `l`. This is correct and ensures that the list is modified to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

6. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function prints the result of the permutation.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It prints an empty line after the elements. This is correct and follows the output format specified in the problem.

7. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function calls `func_4` to get the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print the result. This is correct and ensures that the program handles both valid and invalid cases.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly handles the input, generates the required permutation, and prints the results in the correct format. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
