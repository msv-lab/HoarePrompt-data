### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of 2n integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts the list of integers. Sorting is a crucial step because it ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, which is necessary to maximize the score.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number of each pair to the score. This is because, in a sorted list, the first number of each pair is the smaller one.
   - The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` correctly pairs the numbers and adds the smaller number of each pair to the score.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the score for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score by always choosing the smaller number in each pair of the sorted list. This approach ensures that the score is maximized, and the output matches the expected results for the given examples.
