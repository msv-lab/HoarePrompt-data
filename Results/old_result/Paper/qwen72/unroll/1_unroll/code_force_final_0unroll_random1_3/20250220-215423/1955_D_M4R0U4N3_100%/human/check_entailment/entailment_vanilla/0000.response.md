### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The function `func()` initializes a list `cnt_b` to keep track of the frequency of elements in array `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.

2. **Reading Test Case Data:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

3. **Counting Frequencies in `b`:**
   - It populates the `cnt_b` list with the frequencies of elements in `b`.

4. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subsegment.
   - It checks the first subsegment of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each element in the first subsegment, if it is in `b_values` (a set of unique elements in `b`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check all subsegments of length `m` in `a`:
     - For each new element added to the window (`a[i + m]`), it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count is non-negative.
     - For each element removed from the window (`a[i]`), it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count is positive.
     - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

6. **Resetting `cnt_b`:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly initializes and processes each test case.
- The sliding window approach is used effectively to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
- The conditions for updating `curr` and `ans` are correctly implemented.
- The program resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the next test case, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
