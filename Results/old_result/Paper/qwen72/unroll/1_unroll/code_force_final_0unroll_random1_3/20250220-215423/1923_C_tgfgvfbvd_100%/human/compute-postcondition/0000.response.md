The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. For the loop to execute, the range of the loop must be greater than 0. The range is determined by the input value, which is cast to an integer using `int(input())`. 

Given the initial state, the variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is stated that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. This means `t` is at least 1, ensuring that the loop will execute at least once. However, the loop counter `_` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, and it starts from 0 by default.

To ensure the loop executes, the input value must be at least 1, which is guaranteed by the constraint on `t`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute, as the input will always be within the valid range.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0 (implied by the loop structure)**
