Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is 2. When `n` is 2, the program will not enter the first for loop (since `range(2, n)` will be an empty range), and `k` will remain 1. The second for loop will also not execute (since `range(1, n)` will only include 1, and the loop condition `i < n` will not be met). As a result, the program will output `! 1 0` for `n = 2`, which is incorrect because the only valid indices are 0 and 1, and the correct output should be `! 0 1`. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to find a pair of indices such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized, and for `n = 2`, the only possible pair is `0` and `1`.
