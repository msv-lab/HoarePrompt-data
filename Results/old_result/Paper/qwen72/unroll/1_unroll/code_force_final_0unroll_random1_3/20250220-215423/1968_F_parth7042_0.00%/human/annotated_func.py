#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Each `n` and `q` are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: `idx` is `1 + 2 * t + 2 * sum(n + q for n, q, _, _ in test_cases)`, `results` is a list containing the results of each test case query followed by an empty string for each test case.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: [result of test case 0]
    #[empty line]
    #[result of test case 1]
    #[empty line]
    #...
    #[result of test case (m-1)]
    #[empty line]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of a list of integers and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if there is a subarray whose XOR is zero and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list accordingly. After processing all queries for all test cases, the function prints the results, with each test case's results separated by an empty line. The function does not return any value.
