Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes the test cases, and computes the time it takes to reach each query point, rounding down to the nearest integer. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.

2. **Initialization of Arrays**:
   - `a` is initialized with the positions of the signs, prefixed by 0.
   - `b` is initialized with the times the car reaches these positions, prefixed by 0.
   - `ad` and `bd` are initialized to store the differences in positions and times between consecutive signs, respectively.
   - `v` is initialized to store the speeds between consecutive signs.

3. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the speed `v[i]` for each segment between signs as the ratio of the distance `ad[i]` to the time `bd[i]`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `ql` lies.
   - If the query point `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly prints the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by adding the time to reach the previous known point and the time to travel the remaining distance in the current segment.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
