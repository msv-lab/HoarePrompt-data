The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each containing the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of cities, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `a`: a list of n integers representing the positions of the cities in ascending order, where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
- `m`: an integer representing the number of queries, where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5.
- `queries`: a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i), where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

The function returns the closest city to each city specified in the queries. For every city, the closest city is determined uniquely. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the number of cities `n`, a list of city positions `a` in ascending order, the number of queries `m`, and a list of queries `queries`. It returns the closest city to each city specified in the queries, ensuring that the closest city is determined uniquely for each city.**
