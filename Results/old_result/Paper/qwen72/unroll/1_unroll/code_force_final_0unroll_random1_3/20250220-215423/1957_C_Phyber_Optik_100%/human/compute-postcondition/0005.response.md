Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` representing the size of a chessboard. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`. The function then calculates `dp[n]` using a loop that iterates from 3 to `n`, updating `dp[i]` based on the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. After the loop, the function returns `dp[n]`, which represents the result of the computation for a chessboard of size `n`. **
