The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `c`, `k`, and `l`, where `c` and `k` are non-negative integers, and `l` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, with n being the length of `l`. It returns the list `l` with the elements at positions `-c - k` and `-c` swapped. The final state of the program is that the list `l` has the same elements but with the specified elements at the positions `-c - k` and `-c` exchanged.
