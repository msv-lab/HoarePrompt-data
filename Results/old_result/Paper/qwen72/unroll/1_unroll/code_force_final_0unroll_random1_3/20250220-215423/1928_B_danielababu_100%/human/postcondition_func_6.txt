The function `func_7` reads a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, sorts the integers in ascending order, and returns a list of the sorted integers as strings. The function does not modify any external variables and operates solely on the input provided. After the function concludes, the returned list contains the sorted string representations of the integers.
