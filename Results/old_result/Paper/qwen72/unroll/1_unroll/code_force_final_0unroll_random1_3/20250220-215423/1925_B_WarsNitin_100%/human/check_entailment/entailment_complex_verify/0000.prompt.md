You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import sqrt

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x and n are unchanged, and ans contains the largest integer divisor of x such that (x - n * divisor) is divisible by the divisor and non-negative.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from user input. The function then calculates and prints the largest integer divisor of `x` such that `(x - n * divisor)` is divisible by the divisor and non-negative. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 10^3, and `x` and `n` are unchanged for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum balance (GCD) that can be achieved by breaking the problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The approach used is to iterate through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`, and for each divisor, it checks if it can be used to form `n` sub-problems with the same GCD. If so, it updates the maximum balance.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.
2. **Divisor Iteration**: It iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor.
3. **Balance Calculation**:
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. This ensures that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0`, `x // i > 0`, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. This ensures that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `x // i`.
   - It updates the maximum balance `ans` with the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid divisors `i` and `x // i`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum balance for each test case.

The program handles edge cases such as when `x` is 1 or when `n` is equal to `x`. It also efficiently finds the maximum balance by leveraging the properties of divisors and the GCD.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to work correctly for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
