### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves every second in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down.
   - After moving, the robot follows the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and all arrows point either left or right.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the robot can reach cell (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It iterates through the first half of the columns (since n is even, `half_n = n // 2`).
   - For each column `i` in the range `0` to `half_n - 1`, it checks if the robot can get stuck:
     - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the robot will get stuck and cannot move further.
   - After the loop, it checks the last column:
     - If `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and `row2[n - 2]` is '<', the robot will get stuck in the last column.
   - If none of these conditions are met, the robot can reach cell (2, n).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if the robot can get stuck in the grid.
   - The loop in `func_1` ensures that the robot does not get stuck in the first half of the grid.
   - The additional check for the last column ensures that the robot can move to the final column.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results as required.
