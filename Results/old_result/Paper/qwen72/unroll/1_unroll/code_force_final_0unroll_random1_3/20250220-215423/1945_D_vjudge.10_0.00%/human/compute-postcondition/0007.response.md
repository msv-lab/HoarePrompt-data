Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `num_fila` and `max_p` and two lists of integers `a_values` and `b_values`. It calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions specified in the loops and appends this cost to the list `custos`. After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the list `custos` exactly once, in the order they appear. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not directly used or modified within the function. **
