Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', and `results` is a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing in the corresponding string `a` to reach the frequency `m`.**
