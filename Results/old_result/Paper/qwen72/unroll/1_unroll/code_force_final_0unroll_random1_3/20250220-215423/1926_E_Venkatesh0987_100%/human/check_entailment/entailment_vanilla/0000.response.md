### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - We need to determine the k-th card laid down in this process.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - The first \((n + 1) // 2\) cards laid down are the odd-numbered cards.
   - If \(k \leq (n + 1) // 2\), the k-th card is simply the k-th odd number, which is \(2k - 1\).

3. **Handling \(k > (n + 1) // 2\):**
   - If \(k > (n + 1) // 2\), the k-th card must be one of the cards that are multiples of 2, 4, 6, etc.
   - We need to determine the position of the card in the sequence of these multiples.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program first checks if \(k \leq (n + 1) // 2\). If true, it prints \(2k - 1\), which is correct.
   - If \(k > (n + 1) // 2\), the program enters a loop to find the correct position of the k-th card in the sequence of multiples.
   - The loop increments \(i\) and adjusts \(s\) and \(d\) to count the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The variable \(g\) is used to track the cumulative count of cards laid down up to the previous step.
   - The variable \(f\) is calculated as \(k - g\), which gives the position of the card in the current step.
   - The final card is calculated as \(2^{i-1} \times (2f - 1)\).

5. **Verification:**
   - For \(k \leq (n + 1) // 2\), the program correctly prints the k-th odd number.
   - For \(k > (n + 1) // 2\), the program correctly calculates the position of the card in the sequence of multiples of 2, 4, 6, etc.
   - The loop ensures that the correct step is found, and the final calculation correctly identifies the k-th card.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \(n = 1\) and \(k = 1\) correctly.
   - The program also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(k\) correctly, as demonstrated in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles both the initial odd-numbered cards and the subsequent multiples of odd numbers.

**Correctness: True**
