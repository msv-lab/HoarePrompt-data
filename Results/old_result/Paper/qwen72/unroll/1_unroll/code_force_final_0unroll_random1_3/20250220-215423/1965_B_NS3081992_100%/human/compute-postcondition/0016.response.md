Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `l` remains unchanged, `bk` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) and the last element is `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `lk` remains unchanged.**

The code appends the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. The list `ans` initially contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2). After the code execution, the list `ans` now includes an additional element, which is the result of `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk`) remain unchanged.
