The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `ratings` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and an integer `k` representing the index of your cow. The list `ratings` contains `n` distinct integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= n`. The integer `k` is the index (1-based) of your cow in the list `ratings`. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
