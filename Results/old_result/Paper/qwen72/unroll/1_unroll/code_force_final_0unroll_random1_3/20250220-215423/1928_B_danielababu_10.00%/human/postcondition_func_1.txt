The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a map object that can be iterated over to access the sequence of integers provided by the user.
