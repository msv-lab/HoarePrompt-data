Output State: **The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`, where `group_a` contains the largest `na` elements from the list `numbers`, `group_b` contains the next largest `nb` elements, and `group_c` contains the smallest `nc` elements. The sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` respectively, and these sums satisfy the condition `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)`.**
