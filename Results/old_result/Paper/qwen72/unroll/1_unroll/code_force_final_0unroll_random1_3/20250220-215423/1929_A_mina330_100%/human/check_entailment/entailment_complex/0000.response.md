Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element. The program sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is printed as the result for each test case.

However, this approach is incorrect for the problem. Sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array. The correct approach to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This ensures that each difference is maximized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`. Sorting it in descending order gives `[3, 2, 1]`, and the beauty is calculated as `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2`, which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

The program provided, however, simply calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the sorted array, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum beauty.

Correctness: **False**
