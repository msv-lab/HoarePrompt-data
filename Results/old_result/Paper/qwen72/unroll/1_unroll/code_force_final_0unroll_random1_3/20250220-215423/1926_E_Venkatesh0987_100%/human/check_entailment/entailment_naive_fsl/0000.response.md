Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is a large number and `k` is close to `n`. Specifically, the program fails to correctly compute the k-th card laid down when `k` is in the range of cards that are multiples of higher powers of 2.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 8
```
According to the problem description, the order in which Vladislav lays down the cards for `n = 10` should be:
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 10, 4, 8

The 8th card laid down should be 10. However, the program outputs 9, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic that calculates the position of the card in the sequence of multiples of higher powers of 2. The program incorrectly handles the transition between different groups of cards (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.), leading to incorrect results for certain values of `k`.
