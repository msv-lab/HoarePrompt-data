The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is a positive integer with a range of 1 to 1000, and `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` (with `n` ranging from 2 to 10^6 and `k` ranging from 1 to `n`). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in the `results` list is a tuple `(25, sequence)`, where `sequence` is a list of 25 elements. Each element in `sequence` is 2 raised to the power of its index, starting from 0 up to 24.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` tuples, each of which is `(25, sequence)`, where `sequence` is a list of 25 elements, each element being 2 raised to the power of its index from 0 to 24.**
