Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, this approach does not maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

To maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This can be achieved by alternating the largest and smallest elements. For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the optimal rearrangement would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` or `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which would give a beauty of `(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-3) = 4 + 2 + 0 = 6`.

The correct solution should involve rearranging the array in this alternating manner and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The provided program does not perform this rearrangement, hence it is incorrect.
