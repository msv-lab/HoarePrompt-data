Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and prints the results as specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading a time string `s` in each iteration. This matches the problem description.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it converts it to `12` and prints it, which is correct for the 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it prints the hour as is, which is correct for the 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour and prints it with a leading zero if necessary, which is also correct for the 12-hour format.

3. **Minute Handling**: The function correctly appends the minutes from the input string `s` to the output.

4. **AM/PM Handling**: The function correctly appends 'AM' if the hour is less than 12 and 'PM' if the hour is 12 or greater.

5. **Output Format**: The function prints the time in the correct format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" as required.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly handle all the specified requirements and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
