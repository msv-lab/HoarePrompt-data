Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the relationship between `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the function performs a series of calculations and prints a value derived from these calculations. Otherwise, it simply prints `2 * k - 1`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) and processes each test case independently, with the state of variables reset for each new test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the results are printed to the console. **
