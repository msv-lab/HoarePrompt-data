Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing `n` (number of problems in the bank), `m` (number of rounds), and `a` (string of problem difficulties). This is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: The program initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 elements (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'). It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding frequency in the list using the expression `freq[ord(prob) - ord('A')] += 1`. This mapping is correct and ensures that each character from 'A' to 'G' is mapped to the correct index in the frequency list.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the frequency of a particular difficulty level. This expression correctly ensures that if there are already enough problems of a certain difficulty, the expression returns 0. The `sum` function then adds up the missing problems for all difficulty levels. This is also accurate and matches the problem requirements.

4. **Result Collection**: The results for each test case are collected in a list `results` and returned by the function `func_1`. This is done correctly and matches the expected output format.

5. **Output**: The main part of the program iterates over the results and prints them, which matches the expected output format.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
