You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a single test case. It accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr` from user input. It generates a list `mex` where each element is determined based on the current smallest non-negative integer not found in the `used` dictionary. If the current element in `arr` is positive, the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is added to `mex`. If the current element is non-positive, the absolute difference between the current element and the smallest non-negative integer not in `used` is added to `mex`. After processing all elements, the function prints each element in `mex` separated by a space, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value, and the final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `arr`, the `mex` list that has been printed, and the `used` dictionary that contains all integers added to `mex` as keys with their values set to `True`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases for constructing the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
The program constructs the permutation `p` by appending values to the `mex` list. However, the logic for handling negative values in `arr` is incorrect. Specifically, the line:
```python
mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
```
is problematic. Let's break down the steps for the given input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex = []`
   - `minn = 0`
   - `used = {}`

2. **First iteration (i = 0):**
   - `arr[0] = 1`
   - `1 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(0)`, `used[0] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `1`.
   - `mex = [0]`

3. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   - `arr[1] = 1`
   - `1 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(1)`, `used[1] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `2`.
   - `mex = [0, 1]`

4. **Third iteration (i = 2):**
   - `arr[2] = -2`
   - `1 > 0` is false, so `mex.append(abs(-2 - 2))`, `used[4] = True`.
   - `mex = [0, 1, 4]`

5. **Fourth iteration (i = 3):**
   - `arr[3] = 1`
   - `1 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(2)`, `used[2] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `3`.
   - `mex = [0, 1, 4, 2]`

6. **Fifth iteration (i = 4):**
   - `arr[4] = 2`
   - `2 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(3)`, `used[3] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `4`.
   - `mex = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

The program outputs `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct for this specific input. However, the logic for handling negative values in `arr` is flawed. For example, consider the following input:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -1 1 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 2 2 4
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
In the third iteration, `arr[2] = -1`, and the program appends `abs(-1 - 2) = 3` to `mex`. However, the correct value should be `3` to maintain the MEX property. The program incorrectly appends `2` instead of `3`, leading to an invalid permutation.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
