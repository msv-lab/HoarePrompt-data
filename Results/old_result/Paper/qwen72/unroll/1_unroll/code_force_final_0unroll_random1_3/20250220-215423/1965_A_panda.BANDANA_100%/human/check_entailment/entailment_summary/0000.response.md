### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `l`.

2. **Unique Pile Sizes:**
   - The function converts the list of pile sizes `l` to a sorted set `lis` to get the unique pile sizes. This is a good approach because it helps in identifying the distinct pile sizes and their order.

3. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The function checks if `1` is not in the list of unique pile sizes or if the list has only one unique pile size. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'Alice'.
     - **Correctness:** This is correct because if there is no pile of size 1, Alice can always choose a `k` that will not leave any pile with exactly 1 stone, ensuring she can always make a move. If there is only one unique pile size, Alice can choose that size and win immediately.

4. **Consecutive Pile Sizes:**
   - The function then iterates through the sorted list of unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1.
     - If the difference is greater than 1, it determines the winner based on the parity of the index `j` of the first such pair.
     - **Correctness:** This is correct because the first player (Alice) who encounters a gap of more than 1 between consecutive pile sizes can force the game into a state where the next player (Bob) will be at a disadvantage. The parity of the index `j` helps determine who will be the first to encounter this gap and thus who will win.

5. **Final Condition:**
   - If no such gap is found, the function determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of unique pile sizes.
     - **Correctness:** This is correct because if all pile sizes are consecutive, the game essentially reduces to a Nim game with a single pile of size equal to the number of unique pile sizes. The parity of this number determines the winner, as in a Nim game with a single pile, the first player wins if the pile size is odd, and the second player wins if the pile size is even.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. It handles all the edge cases and conditions specified in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
