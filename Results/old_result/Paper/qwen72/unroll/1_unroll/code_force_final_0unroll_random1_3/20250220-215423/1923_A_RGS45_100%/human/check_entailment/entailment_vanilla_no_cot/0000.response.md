Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the state of the cells as a string `arr` (after removing spaces).

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the string.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the string by reversing the string and finding the first chip from the reversed string.

3. **Extracting the Substring**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the substring from the first chip to the last chip, inclusive. This substring will contain all the chips and any free cells (0) between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) in the extracted substring and prints it. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. The program correctly identifies the range of cells containing chips and counts the free cells within that range, which is the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.
