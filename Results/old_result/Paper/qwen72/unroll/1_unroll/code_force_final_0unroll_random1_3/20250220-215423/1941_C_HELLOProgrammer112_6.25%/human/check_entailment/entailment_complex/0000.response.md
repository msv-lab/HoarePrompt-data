Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because it only counts the occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" and prints their sum. However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the string `s`. The program does not handle overlapping occurrences of these substrings or the removal of the minimum number of characters to achieve the goal. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program counts "map" once and "pie" once, but it should actually remove 2 characters to make the string beautiful (e.g., removing the 4th and 9th characters).

Additionally, the program does not account for the fact that removing a single character can affect multiple substrings. For instance, in the string "mappppie", removing the 'p' at the 4th position can eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
