Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be defined as follows to match the problem description:

```python
def can_form_another_rectangle(a, b):
```

This function will determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given a x b rectangle.
