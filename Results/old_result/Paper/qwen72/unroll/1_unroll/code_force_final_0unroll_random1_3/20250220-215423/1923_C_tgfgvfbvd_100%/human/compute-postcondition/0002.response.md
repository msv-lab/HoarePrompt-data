The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of elements in the list `c`.
  - `q`: an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of queries.
  - `c`: a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the list.
  - `queries`: a list of `q` tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, representing the queries.

The function returns:
- For each test case, a list of results corresponding to each query. Each result is the sum of the elements in the list `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `q`, a list `c` of `n` integers, and a list `queries` of `q` tuples. It returns a list of sums for each query, where each sum is the total of elements in `c` from index `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive).**
