Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `func_5(l)` has been called.** 

The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the results of `func_4()`. The value of `l` is still the result of `func_1(n, k)`. The function `func_5(l)` has been called, but since we do not have the implementation details of `func_5`, we cannot determine its specific impact on the state. However, it is clear that `func_5` has been executed with `l` as its argument.
