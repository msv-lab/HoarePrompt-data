The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
