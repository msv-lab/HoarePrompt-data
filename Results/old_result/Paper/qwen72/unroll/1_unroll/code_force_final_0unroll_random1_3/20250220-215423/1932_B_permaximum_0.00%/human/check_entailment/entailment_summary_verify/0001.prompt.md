You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). It then calculates a value `year` by summing `year % ai or ai` for each `ai` in the list `a`. The function prints the calculated `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` is 0, `n` is the last input integer received, and `a` is the last list of integers received. The variable `year` holds the final calculated value for the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a list of periodicities for different signs of the apocalypse.
   - The signs occur in a sequential manner, and the i-th sign must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.
   - We need to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, which will be the year of the apocalypse.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - For each `ai`, it updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - `year % ai` computes the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai` if `year % ai` is non-zero, otherwise it evaluates to `ai`.
   - This means:
     - If `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, it adds the remainder to `year` to make it the next multiple of `ai`.
     - If `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it adds `ai` to `year`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic ensures that `year` is always updated to the next occurrence of the sign `ai` after the previous sign has occurred.
   - This is because if `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, it will be incremented to the next multiple of `ai` (i.e., `year + (ai - year % ai)`).
   - If `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it will be incremented by `ai` to the next occurrence of the sign.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
     - Second sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since 3 % 2 = 1).
     - Third sign: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since 4 % 4 = 0).
     - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since 8 % 5 = 3).
     - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since 10 % 9 = 1).
     - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since 18 % 18 = 0).
   - The output is `36`, which matches the expected result.

   - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`.
     - Second sign: `year = 1 + 1 = 2` (since 1 % 2 = 1).
     - Third sign: `year = 2 + 1 = 3` (since 2 % 3 = 2).
     - Fourth sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since 3 % 4 = 3).
     - Fifth sign: `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since 4 % 5 = 4).
   - The output is `5`, which matches the expected result.

   - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - Each sign will add 1 to `year` because `year % 1` is always 0.
     - The output is `5`, which matches the expected result.

   - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign: `year = 0 + 50 = 50`.
     - Second sign: `year = 50 + 10 = 60` (since 50 % 30 = 20).
     - Third sign: `year = 60 + 651 = 711` (since 60 % 711 = 60).
     - Fourth sign: `year = 711 + 129 = 840` (since 711 % 200 = 111).
     - Fifth sign: `year = 840 + 163 = 1003` (since 840 % 503 = 337).
     - Sixth sign: `year = 1003 + 1009 = 2012` (since 1003 % 1006 = 1).
   - The output is `2012`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The examples provided also verify that the program produces the correct output.
