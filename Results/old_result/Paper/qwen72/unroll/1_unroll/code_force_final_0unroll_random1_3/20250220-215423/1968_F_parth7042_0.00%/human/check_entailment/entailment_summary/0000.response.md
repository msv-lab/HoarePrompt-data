Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining if a subarray can be split into multiple parts where the bitwise XOR of each part is the same. Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is an efficient way to handle large inputs, especially when the number of test cases and queries can be up to 10^4 and 2 * 10^5, respectively.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`. This allows for quick computation of the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**:
   - The program maintains a dictionary `mp` that maps each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where that prefix XOR occurs. This is used to efficiently check if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it means the subarray can be split into multiple parts where each part's XOR is zero, and the program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If the XOR is not zero, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect` module to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.
   - If such indices exist, it means the subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value, and the program appends 'YES'. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end, with each test case's results separated by an empty line.

The program's logic is sound and follows the problem description accurately. It efficiently handles the input and queries, and the use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
