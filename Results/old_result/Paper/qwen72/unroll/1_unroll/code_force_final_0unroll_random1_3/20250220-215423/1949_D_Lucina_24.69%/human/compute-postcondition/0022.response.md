Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a symmetric transition video plan. It then processes this plan to determine the counts of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) transitions for each row and column. Based on these counts, it identifies rows that have only 'F' transitions and columns that have only 'S' transitions. If the number of rows with only 'F' transitions is greater than or equal to the number of columns with only 'S' transitions, it adds any undecided rows (rows with no transitions) to the list of rows with only 'F' transitions and prints a modified transition plan where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' for the first quarter of these rows and 'S' for the rest. If the number of rows with only 'F' transitions is less than the number of columns with only 'S' transitions, it adds any undecided rows to the list of columns with only 'S' transitions and prints a modified transition plan where '?' characters are replaced with 'S' for the first quarter of these columns and 'F' for the rest. The original input values `n` and the list of strings `xx` remain unchanged. **
