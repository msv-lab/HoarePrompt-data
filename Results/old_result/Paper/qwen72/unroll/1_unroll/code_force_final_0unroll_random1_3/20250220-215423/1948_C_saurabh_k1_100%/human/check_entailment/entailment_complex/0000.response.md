### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
   - This matches the problem description and constraints.

2. **Loop and Conditions:**
   - The function iterates over the columns in steps of 2, starting from 1 (i.e., it checks every odd-indexed column).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`: This means that the arrow in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i + 1` both point left.
     - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`: This means that the arrow in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i - 1` both point left.
   - If either of these conditions is true, the function prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n).
   - If the loop completes without finding such a condition, the function prints 'Yes', indicating that the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

3. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The conditions are designed to detect situations where the robot would be trapped in a loop or unable to move further to the right.
   - Specifically, if `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`, the robot would move from (1, i) to (2, i + 1) and then back to (1, i), creating a loop.
   - Similarly, if `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, the robot would move from (1, i) to (2, i - 1) and then back to (1, i), also creating a loop.
   - These conditions are necessary to ensure that the robot can move to the right without getting stuck.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'No' or 'Yes' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the constraints: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, `n` is even, and the sum of all `n` values does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `n` is 2, as it will only check the first odd-indexed position (i.e., `i = 1`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given conditions. The conditions are sufficient to detect loops or traps that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell.

**Correctness: True**
