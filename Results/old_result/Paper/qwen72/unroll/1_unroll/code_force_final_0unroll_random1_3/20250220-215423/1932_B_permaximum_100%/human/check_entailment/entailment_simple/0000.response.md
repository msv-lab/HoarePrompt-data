### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, storing them in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case, extracting the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next year `next_year` when the sign will occur:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
   - It updates `current_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.
   - After processing all signs, it appends `current_year` to the results list.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are the years when the n-th sign occurs.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the next year when each sign occurs is correct. The formula `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
   - The program correctly handles the sequential nature of the signs, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when all periodicities are 1 (e.g., the third test case) and when the periodicities are large (e.g., the fourth test case).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the n-th sign occurs, based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
