### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements that can be equal in an array after adding a permutation of the same length to it. The provided program does not actually solve this problem. Instead, it defines several functions that read input and perform operations that are unrelated to the problem statement. Let's break down the functions and see why they are not correct:

1. **func_1()**:
   - Reads a single integer from the input.
   - This function is used to read the number of test cases, which is correct.

2. **func_2()**:
   - Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - This function is used to read the array length and the array itself, but it returns a map object, which is not directly useful for further processing.

3. **func_3()**:
   - Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - This function is similar to `func_2()` but returns a list, which is more useful for further processing.

4. **func_4()**:
   - Reads a line of input, splits it into a list of integers, and sorts the list.
   - Sorting the array is not necessary for solving the problem, and this function does not return the required output.

5. **func_5()**:
   - Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This function is not useful for the problem as it does not handle integers.

6. **func_6()**:
   - Reads a line of input and returns it as a list of characters.
   - This function is not useful for the problem as it does not handle integers.

7. **func_7()**:
   - Reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and sorts the list.
   - This function is not useful for the problem as it does not handle integers.

8. **func_8(arr)**:
   - Takes a list of integers and returns a list where each element is the product of all previous elements in the list.
   - This function is not related to the problem of finding the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation.

9. **func_9(arr)**:
   - Takes a list of integers and returns a list where each element is the product of all previous elements in the list, but in reverse order.
   - This function is not related to the problem of finding the maximum number of equal elements after adding a permutation.

### Correctness:
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It lacks the logic to determine the maximum number of elements that can be equal after adding a permutation to the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
