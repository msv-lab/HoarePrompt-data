Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start` <= n and 1 <= `target` <= n, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)` where the first element is the starting node and the second element is the distance 0.**
