#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of distinct characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the corresponding string `a` so that each character appears at least `m` times.
