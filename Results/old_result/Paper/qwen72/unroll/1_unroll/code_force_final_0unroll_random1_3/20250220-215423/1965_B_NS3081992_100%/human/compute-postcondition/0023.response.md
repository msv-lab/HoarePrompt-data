Output State: **The program returns a string that starts with the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline character, and then a space-separated string of the elements in `ans`.**

- If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), the output will be the length of this list followed by the elements of the list.
- Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and the new last element is `2 * k + 1`, and additional elements from 2^lk to 2^(l-1). The output will be the length of this list followed by the elements of the list.
