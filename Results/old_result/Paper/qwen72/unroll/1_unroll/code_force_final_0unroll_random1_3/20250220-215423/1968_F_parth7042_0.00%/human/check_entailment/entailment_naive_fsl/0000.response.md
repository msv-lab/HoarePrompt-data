Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it checks for the possibility of splitting the subarray into parts with equal XOR values. Specifically, the logic in the following lines is flawed:

```python
v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] <= r) and (v2[it2] >= l):
    results.append('YES')
else:
    results.append('NO')
```

The program attempts to find indices where the prefix XOR values match the XOR of the subarray, but it does not correctly handle the case where the subarray can be split into multiple parts with the same XOR value. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 1
1 2 3 4 5
1 5
```

The subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` can be split into parts with equal XOR values, such as `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5]` where `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 = 0` and `4 ^ 5 = 1`, but the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly check for the possibility of such a split.

This indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, leading to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
