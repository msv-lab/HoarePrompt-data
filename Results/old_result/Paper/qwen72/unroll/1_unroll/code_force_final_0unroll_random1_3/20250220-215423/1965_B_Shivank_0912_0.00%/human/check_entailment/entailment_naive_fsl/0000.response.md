Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem requirements for every potential case. Specifically, the program generates a fixed sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]` for all test cases, which is not guaranteed to meet the conditions for all inputs.

For example, consider the test case `(n=8, k=8)`. The sequence generated by the program is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`. This sequence contains the number 8, which means there is a subsequence (specifically, the subsequence `[8]`) that sums to 8, violating the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of 8.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
