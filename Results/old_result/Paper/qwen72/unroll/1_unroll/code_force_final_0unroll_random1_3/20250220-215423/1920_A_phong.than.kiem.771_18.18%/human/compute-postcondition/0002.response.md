The only variables in the loop head are `index`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `index`. If `index` is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` or -1 if `substring` is not found. For the loop to execute the first time, `index` must be a valid index (i.e., not -1).

State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string that is a potential substring of `string`, `indices` is an empty list, `index` must be a valid index (not -1)**
