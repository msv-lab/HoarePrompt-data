You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on the following conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2` (as an integer); if `A` is odd, it prints `(A // 2) * C + B`. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` provided before the function call. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts is equal to or greater than the price of buying two yogurts at the regular price. In such cases, the program should always choose the regular price, but it does not do so correctly.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input: `2 5 10`
- Expected Output: `10`
- Actual Output: `10` (This is correct, but the logic is flawed and will fail in other cases.)

Another example:
- Input: `3 5 10`
- Expected Output: `15`
- Actual Output: `20` (This is incorrect. The program should output 15, as it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts at the regular price of 5 burles each rather than using the promotion price for two yogurts and buying one at the regular price.)

The program should compare the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price with the promotion price and use the cheaper option. The current logic does not always ensure this.
