The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the expression `i * i <= n + i`. To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `i * i <= n + i` is true when the loop starts.

Given:
- `i` is 1
- `n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`
- `ans` is 0

Let's evaluate the condition with the initial values:
- `i * i` is `1 * 1` which is `1`
- `n + i` is `n + 1`

For the loop to execute the first time, `1` (which is `i * i`) must be less than or equal to `n + 1`. This simplifies to `1 <= n + 1`, which is always true for any non-negative value of `n`.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time, as the condition will always be true for `i` starting at 1 and `n` being any non-negative value.

State: **`n` and `m` are the values returned by `func_7()`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0**
