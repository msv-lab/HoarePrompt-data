You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

            - a (str): String of problem difficulties.

    Returns:

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n`, an integer `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of distinct characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the corresponding string `a` so that each character appears at least `m` times.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with in order to hold the specified number of rounds. It does this by counting the frequency of each difficulty level in the given string and then determining how many more problems of each difficulty are needed to meet the requirement of having at least `m` problems of each difficulty level. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases, including cases where there are not enough problems of any difficulty level, and cases where there are more than enough problems of some difficulty levels. The program also correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
