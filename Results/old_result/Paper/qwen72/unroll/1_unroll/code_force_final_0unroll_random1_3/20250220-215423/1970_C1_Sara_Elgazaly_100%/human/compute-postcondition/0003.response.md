The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop depends on the value of `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 1. The variable `x` is derived from the input, and it is an integer. The other variables (`y`, `lst`, `rev`, `n`, `t`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` must be greater than 1, `_` is 0**
