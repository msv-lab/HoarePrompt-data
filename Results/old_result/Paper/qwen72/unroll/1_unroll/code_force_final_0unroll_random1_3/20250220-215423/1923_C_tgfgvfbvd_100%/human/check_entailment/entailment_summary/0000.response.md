Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input, reading the number of test cases, the size of the array, the array itself, and the queries. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Auxiliary Lists Construction**:
   - `p` is a list that stores the cumulative sum of the elements in the array `l`.
   - `c` is a list that stores the cumulative count of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `(a, b)`, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `l[a:b+1]` using the cumulative sum list `p`.
   - It also calculates the count of 1s in the subarray `l[a:b+1]` using the cumulative count list `c`.
   - The program then checks if the subarray is "good" by verifying the condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, where `s` is the sum of the subarray and `i` is the count of 1s in the subarray.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is at least as large as the number of 1s in the subarray. This is necessary because for the subarray to be "good," we need to find a corresponding array `b` where each element is different from the corresponding element in `a` and all elements in `b` are positive.
   - If `s - (b - a + 1) >= i`, it means we have enough "slack" in the sum to change all 1s to some other positive number without making the sum of `b` less than the sum of `a`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray length is 1. If `b - a + 1 == 1`, the subarray cannot be "good" because there is no way to change a single element to a different positive number while maintaining the sum.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the subarray length is greater than 1 and the sum condition is met.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is "good" and 'NO' otherwise, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
