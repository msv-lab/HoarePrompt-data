### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases.
   - The input constraints are \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \).

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then for each test case, reads an integer \( n \).
   - For each \( n \), it outputs the sum of the digit sums of all integers from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program uses a precomputed list `pd` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - The list `pd` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( N \) (where \( N = 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \)):
     - `pd[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of \( i \).
   - This precomputation step ensures that for any given \( n \), the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( n \) can be retrieved in constant time \( O(1) \).

4. **Precomputation**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(N \times \log_{10}(N)) \) time, where \( N = 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \).
   - This is efficient because \( \log_{10}(N) \) is a small constant (around 6 for \( N = 2 \times 10^5 \)).

5. **Query Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads an integer \( n \) and prints `pd[n]`.
   - This step runs in \( O(t) \) time, where \( t \) is the number of test cases.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step is \( O(N \times \log_{10}(N)) \), which is \( O(2 \times 10^5 \times 6) = O(1.2 \times 10^6) \).
   - The query handling step is \( O(t) \), which is \( O(10^4) \).
   - Given the constraints, the program should run within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of digit sums for all integers from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - The query handling step correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed values for each \( n \).

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Initialization**:
  - `N` is set to \( 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \), which is correct.
  - `pd` is initialized with zeros, which is correct.
  - `t` is read from input, which is correct.

- **Precomputation Loop**:
  - `pd[i]` is updated to be the sum of `pd[i-1]` and the sum of the digits of \( i \).
  - This is done correctly by converting \( i \) to a string and summing its digits.
  - The loop runs from 1 to \( N-1 \), which is correct.

- **Query Handling Loop**:
  - For each test case, `n` is read from input.
  - The program prints `pd[n]`, which is the correct value for the sum of digit sums from 1 to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient given the constraints. The precomputation step correctly calculates the cumulative sum of digit sums, and the query handling step correctly retrieves and prints the precomputed values for each \( n \). The time complexity is within the acceptable limits for the given constraints.
