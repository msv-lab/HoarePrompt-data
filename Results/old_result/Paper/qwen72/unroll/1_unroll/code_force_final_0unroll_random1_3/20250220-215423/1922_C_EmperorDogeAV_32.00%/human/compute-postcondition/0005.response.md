Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in strictly ascending order and an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5). It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each element in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, depending on whether the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city. If the distance to the next city is less, the element is 1; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city. **
