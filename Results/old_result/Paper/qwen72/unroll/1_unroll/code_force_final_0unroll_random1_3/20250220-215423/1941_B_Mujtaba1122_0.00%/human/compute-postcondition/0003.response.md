The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES'. The precondition describes a series of modifications to the list `list` based on specific conditions, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly. The `print` statement is simply printing a hardcoded string 'YES'. The fact that `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True` is not directly relevant to what is printed by the `print` statement, but it implies that the conditions described in the precondition have been met, leading to the execution of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
