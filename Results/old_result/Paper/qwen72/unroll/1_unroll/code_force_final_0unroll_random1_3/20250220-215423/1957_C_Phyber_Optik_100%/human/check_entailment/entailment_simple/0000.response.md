### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program sets a high recursion limit and initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with `-1` values.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Dynamic Programming Function:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` initializes the DP array for the first two values: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - It then fills the DP array for values from 3 to `n` using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation is correct for the problem of counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an \( n \times n \) board.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It initializes a set `invalid` to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - It reads the `k` moves and adds the corresponding rows and columns to the `invalid` set.
   - Finally, it prints the number of possible final configurations, which is `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

4. **Correctness of the DP Array:**
   - The DP array is correctly initialized and filled using the recurrence relation.
   - The recurrence relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other, considering both the row and column constraints.

5. **Handling of Invalid Positions:**
   - The set `invalid` is used to keep track of rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.
   - The length of `invalid` is subtracted from `n` to determine the number of remaining valid positions for placing rooks.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the number of possible final configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles the dynamic programming part and the input/output correctly. The use of the `invalid` set to track occupied rows and columns is also appropriate.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
