You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It then counts the number of times a '1' appears immediately before a '0' in the string and prints this count plus one. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, and `s` holds the value of the last input binary string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) into which a binary string can be cut so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character is greater than the next character.
   - If `s[i] > s[i + 1]`, it increments the counter `count`.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`.

3. **Key Insight:**
   - The condition `s[i] > s[i + 1]` will only be true when `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i + 1]` is '0'. This indicates a point where the string is not sorted.
   - Each such point (where '1' is followed by '0') requires a new piece to be created to ensure that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - The total number of pieces needed is `count + 1` because the initial piece is counted as 1, and each transition from '1' to '0' adds one more piece.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: "11010"**
     - Transitions: `11` (no transition), `10` (one transition), `01` (no transition), `10` (one transition)
     - Count: 2
     - Output: 3 (Correct)
   - **Example 2: "00000000"**
     - Transitions: None
     - Count: 0
     - Output: 1 (Correct)
   - **Example 3: "1"**
     - Transitions: None
     - Count: 0
     - Output: 1 (Correct)
   - **Example 4: "10"**
     - Transitions: `10` (one transition)
     - Count: 1
     - Output: 2 (Correct)
   - **Example 5: "0001111"**
     - Transitions: None
     - Count: 0
     - Output: 1 (Correct)
   - **Example 6: "0110"**
     - Transitions: `10` (one transition)
     - Count: 1
     - Output: 2 (Correct)

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly.
   - It handles strings with no transitions correctly.
   - It handles strings with multiple transitions correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
