Functionality: ** The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`, calculated in reverse order. After the function concludes, `arr` remains unchanged, and `ans` contains the cumulative products starting from the last element of `arr` to the first. **
