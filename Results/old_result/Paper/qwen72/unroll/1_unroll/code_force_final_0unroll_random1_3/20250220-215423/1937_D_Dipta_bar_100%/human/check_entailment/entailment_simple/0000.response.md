### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is designed to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - **List `A`**:
     - `A` is used to store the cumulative count of '>' characters from the start of the string `s` up to the current index, adjusted by the distance between consecutive '>' characters and the number of '>' characters seen so far.
     - This list is built correctly by iterating from left to right and updating the cumulative count and indices.
   - **List `B`**:
     - `B` is used to store the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end of the string `s` up to the current index, adjusted by the distance between consecutive '<' characters and the number of '<' characters seen so far.
     - This list is built correctly by iterating from right to left and updating the cumulative count and indices.
   - **Output Calculation**:
     - The program then iterates through each cell of the string `s` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the cumulative counts in `A` and `B`, and the indices in `idx_A` and `idx_B`.
     - If the character is '<', it calculates the time similarly.
     - The calculations for both '>' and '<' seem to be correctly handling the movement and inversion of the pinball.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the border of the grid correctly.
   - For example, if the pinball starts at the first cell and the character is '>', it will move to the right and leave the grid in `n - i` seconds.
   - Similarly, if the pinball starts at the last cell and the character is '<', it will move to the left and leave the grid in `i + 1` seconds.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional lists `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each query in the correct format, separated by spaces and ending with a newline for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell, considering the movement and inversion rules. The edge cases are handled appropriately, and the complexity is within the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
