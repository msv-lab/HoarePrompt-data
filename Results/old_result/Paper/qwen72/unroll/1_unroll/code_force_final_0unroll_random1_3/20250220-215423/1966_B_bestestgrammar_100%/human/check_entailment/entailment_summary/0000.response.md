Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in an n \times m grid the same color using the specified operations. The provided program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid have the same color. If they do not, it then checks if the entire top row and bottom row are the same color, or if the entire left column and right column are the same color. If any of these conditions are met, the program concludes that it is possible to make the entire grid the same color and prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

However, this approach is flawed because it only checks the borders of the grid and does not consider the entire grid. The correct approach should be to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If both colors are present, it is impossible to make the entire grid one color using the given operations. If only one color is present, it is possible to make the entire grid that color.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and the grid.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the top-left corner `gr[0][0]` and the bottom-right corner `gr[n-1][m-1]` have the same color.
   - If they do not, it proceeds to check the borders.

3. **Border Check**:
   - The program checks if the entire top row and bottom row are the same color.
   - It also checks if the entire left column and right column are the same color.
   - If any of these conditions are met, it sets `impossible` to `False`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - If `impossible` is still `True` after the border checks, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The flaw in this logic is that it does not consider the entire grid. For example, if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different but the borders are uniform, it incorrectly concludes that it is impossible to make the entire grid one color. This is not always true, as the interior of the grid could still be uniform or could be changed to a uniform color.

**Correct Approach**:
- The correct approach is to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid.
- If both colors are present, print "NO".
- If only one color is present, print "YES".

Given the flawed logic in the provided program, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
