The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are already defined and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to start, `c` must be 0 and `cases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
