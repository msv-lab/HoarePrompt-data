The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n_cases`. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `n_cases` must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
