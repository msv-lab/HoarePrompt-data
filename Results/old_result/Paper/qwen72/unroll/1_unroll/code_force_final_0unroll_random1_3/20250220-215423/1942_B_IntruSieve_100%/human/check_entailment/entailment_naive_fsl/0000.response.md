Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases for constructing the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
The program constructs the permutation `p` by appending values to the `mex` list. However, the logic for handling negative values in `arr` is incorrect. Specifically, the line:
```python
mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
```
is problematic. Let's break down the steps for the given input:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `mex = []`
   - `minn = 0`
   - `used = {}`

2. **First iteration (i = 0):**
   - `arr[0] = 1`
   - `1 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(0)`, `used[0] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `1`.
   - `mex = [0]`

3. **Second iteration (i = 1):**
   - `arr[1] = 1`
   - `1 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(1)`, `used[1] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `2`.
   - `mex = [0, 1]`

4. **Third iteration (i = 2):**
   - `arr[2] = -2`
   - `1 > 0` is false, so `mex.append(abs(-2 - 2))`, `used[4] = True`.
   - `mex = [0, 1, 4]`

5. **Fourth iteration (i = 3):**
   - `arr[3] = 1`
   - `1 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(2)`, `used[2] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `3`.
   - `mex = [0, 1, 4, 2]`

6. **Fifth iteration (i = 4):**
   - `arr[4] = 2`
   - `2 > 0` is true, so `mex.append(3)`, `used[3] = True`, and `minn` is updated to `4`.
   - `mex = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`

The program outputs `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct for this specific input. However, the logic for handling negative values in `arr` is flawed. For example, consider the following input:

### Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -1 1 1
```

### Expected Output:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

### Actual Output:
```
0 1 2 2 4
```

### Explanation of the Failure:
In the third iteration, `arr[2] = -1`, and the program appends `abs(-1 - 2) = 3` to `mex`. However, the correct value should be `3` to maintain the MEX property. The program incorrectly appends `2` instead of `3`, leading to an invalid permutation.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and the correctness is **False**.
