Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**:
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper or equal to buying them individually, it proceeds to calculate the minimum cost:
     - If `A` is even, it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, so the total cost is `A * C / 2`.
     - If `A` is odd, it means Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the first test case: `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is not less than `C = 9`, the program calculates `A * C / 2 = 2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - For the second test case: `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is not less than `C = 9`, the program calculates `X = 3 // 2 = 1` and `X * C + B = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For the third test case: `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the program calculates `A * B = 3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For the fourth test case: `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the program calculates `A * B = 4 * 5 = 20`.

5. **Critical Analysis**:
   - The logic for determining whether to buy yogurts individually or in pairs is correct.
   - The handling of even and odd numbers of yogurts is also correct.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle edge cases such as when `A = 1` or `A = 2` correctly.
   - For `A = 1`, the program will always buy one yogurt at the regular price `B` because `A % 2 == 1` and `X = 0`.
   - For `A = 2`, the program will correctly choose the cheaper option between `2 * B` and `C`.

7. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program's logic and implementation align with the problem description.
   - The annotated version confirms that the program maintains the correct state and performs the necessary calculations for each test case.
   - The example test cases provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program.

Final: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
