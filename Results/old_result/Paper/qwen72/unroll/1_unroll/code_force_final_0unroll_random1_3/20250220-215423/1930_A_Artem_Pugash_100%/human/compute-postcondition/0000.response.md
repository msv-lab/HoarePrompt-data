The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` and the list of lists are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
