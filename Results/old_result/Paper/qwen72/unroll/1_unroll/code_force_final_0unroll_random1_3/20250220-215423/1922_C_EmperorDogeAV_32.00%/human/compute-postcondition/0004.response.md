The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities` and `n`. `cities` is a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, where each integer is between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The function returns a list `prog_cities` containing `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city, depending on whether the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in strictly ascending order and an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5). It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city, based on the condition that the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.**
