Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Counting Pieces**: For each test case, it initializes a counter `count` to zero. It then iterates through the string `s` and increments `count` whenever it encounters a transition from '1' to '0'. This is because each such transition indicates a point where a cut is necessary to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.
3. **Output**: The program prints `count + 1` for each test case. The `+1` is necessary because the minimum number of pieces is one more than the number of cuts needed.

The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements. The program will correctly determine the minimum number of pieces needed for each test case.
