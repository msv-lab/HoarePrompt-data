You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #State: The value of `numTest` is decremented by the number of iterations completed. The values of `n` and `a` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided during that iteration. The variables `t` and `n` retain their initial values after the loop completes, but the list `a` will be modified according to the operations performed within the loop. The variable `stop` is reset to `False` at the beginning of each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Operation:**
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing the values at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - This operation is designed to reduce the values in the array, and the goal is to determine if it is possible to reduce all elements to zero.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements \( n \) and the array \( a \).

3. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array from the start to the second-to-last element (i.e., \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n-3 \)).
   - For each element \( a[i] \), it performs the operation by decrementing \( a[i] \), \( a[i+1] \), and \( a[i+2] \) by \( a[i] \), \( 2 \times a[i] \), and \( a[i] \) respectively.
   - This step is designed to simulate the operation and check if the array can be reduced to zero.

4. **Early Termination:**
   - If at any point \( a[i] \) is negative, the program prints "NO" and stops processing the current test case. This is because negative values are not allowed in the array, and the operation cannot be applied to negative values.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array \( a[n-2] \) and \( a[n-1] \) are zero.
   - If either of these elements is non-zero, the program prints "NO".
   - If both are zero, the program prints "YES".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array has fewer than 3 elements by the loop condition \( i \) ranges from 0 to \( n-3 \).
   - The program also handles the case where the array elements are already zero by the final check.

7. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly simulates the operation and checks if the array can be reduced to zero.
   - However, there is a potential issue: the program does not handle the case where the operation might make \( a[i+1] \) or \( a[i+2] \) negative. This can lead to incorrect results if the operation is applied in a way that makes subsequent elements negative.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct because it does not handle the case where the operation might make \( a[i+1] \) or \( a[i+2] \) negative. This can lead to incorrect results.

### Example of Incorrectness:
- Consider the array `[1, 2, 1]`:
  - After the first operation at \( i=0 \), the array becomes `[0, 0, 0]`.
  - However, if the array is `[1, 2, 0]`, the operation at \( i=0 \) would make the array `[0, 0, -1]`, which is invalid.

### Correctness: **False**
