### Reasoning:

1. **Original Assessment on `elif mo[1] == 'C':` Block:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be an assignment (`quidditch[1] = mo[0]`) rather than a comparison. This is a critical error because it means the player who catches the Quaffle is not being updated, leading to incorrect behavior when a player tries to catch the Quaffle.

2. **Handling Own-Goal Scoring:**
   - The original assessment also correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should win a point, and vice versa. However, the program incorrectly awards the point to the player's own team.
   - This is evident in the provided example where the red player R0 scores in their own red goal, but the program incorrectly awards a point to the red team instead of the blue team.

3. **Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly identifies an issue with the `func_1` function. The function is intended to accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be tuples or lists containing two integers each. However, the function attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, but `b` is provided as a single integer. This will cause a `ValueError` when the function is called.
   - The annotation states that the function does not return any values, which is incorrect. The function does return a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`, but the error in unpacking `b` will prevent the function from executing correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

- **Original Assessment Accuracy:**
  - The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical error in the `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block and the incorrect handling of own-goal scoring.
  - The annotated code correctly identifies an issue with the `func_1` function, but the annotation about the function not returning any values is incorrect.

- **Program Correctness:**
  - The program has multiple issues that prevent it from functioning correctly:
    - The `elif mo[1] == 'C':` block uses a comparison instead of an assignment.
    - The program does not handle own-goal scoring correctly.
    - The `func_1` function will raise a `ValueError` due to incorrect unpacking of `b`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
