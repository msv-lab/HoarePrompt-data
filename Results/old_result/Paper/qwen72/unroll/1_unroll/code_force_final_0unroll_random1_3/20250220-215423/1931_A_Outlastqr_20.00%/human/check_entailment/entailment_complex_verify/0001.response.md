### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer `n`.
   - This is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - This is correct and useful for mapping indices to letters.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 53 \) followed by "zz".
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of three letters (each with the highest index 26) is 78. If \( n > 52 \), the first letter must be at least 'r' (index 18), and the remaining two letters must be 'z' (index 26) to maximize the sum.
     - Example: For \( n = 70 \), the word is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).

   - **Case 2: \( 26 < n \leq 52 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 28 \) and then 'z'.
     - This is correct because the sum of the first letter 'a' (index 1) and the third letter 'z' (index 26) is 27. Therefore, the second letter must be \( n - 27 \), and the range \( 26 < n \leq 52 \) ensures that \( n - 27 \) is a valid index (1 to 26).
     - Example: For \( n = 55 \), the word is "czz" (1 + 3 + 26 = 55).

   - **Case 3: \( n \leq 26 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 3 \).
     - This is incorrect. The sum of the first two letters 'aa' (each with index 1) is 2, not 3. Therefore, the third letter must be \( n - 2 \), not \( n - 3 \).
     - Example: For \( n = 3 \), the word should be "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), but the program constructs "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) which is correct by coincidence. However, for \( n = 4 \), the word should be "aab" (1 + 1 + 2 = 4), but the program constructs "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), which is incorrect.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly for \( n = 3 \) and \( n = 78 \), but the logic for \( n \leq 26 \) is flawed as explained above.

6. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by:
     - Using 'a' as the first letter whenever possible.
     - Using 'z' as the last letter whenever possible to maximize the sum with the smallest possible first and second letters.
     - Using the smallest possible letter for the second position when the first letter is 'a'.
   - However, the incorrect logic in the case \( n \leq 26 \) means that the word is not always lexicographically smallest.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** due to the incorrect logic in the case \( n \leq 26 \). The program does not always construct the lexicographically smallest word for this range.

Final: **False**
