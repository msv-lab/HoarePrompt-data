The function `goalIn` accepts a parameter `pos` (a tuple of integers) and a parameter `goal` (a list containing two sets of tuples). It returns 0 if `pos` is in the set of red team goals (the first set in the list), 1 if `pos` is in the set of blue team goals (the second set in the list), and -1 if `pos` is not in either set.
