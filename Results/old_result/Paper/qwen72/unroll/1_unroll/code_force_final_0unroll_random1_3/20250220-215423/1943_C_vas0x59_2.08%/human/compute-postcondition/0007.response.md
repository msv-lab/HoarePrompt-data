Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node (0-indexed), and each connection is bidirectional. `d` is the shortest distance from node `a` to all other nodes in the graph represented by `u2vs`. `previous` is a list of the previous nodes in the shortest path from node `a` to all other nodes. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except that a new variable `b` is introduced, which holds the result of calling `func_1(d)`. Since `a` was already assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` will have the same value as `a`.
