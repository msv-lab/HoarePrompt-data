Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function is designed to apply the MEX operation on a segment of the array `a` from index `l` to `r` and store the operation in `ops`.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If so, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively calls itself with the segment `l + 1` to `r`. After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the segment (`r - l + 1`). If so, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`.
   - This function correctly applies the MEX operation and updates the array and operations list as required.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
   - After the recursive calls, it returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
   - The function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function to maximize the sum of the array.

3. **Function 3 (recursive_maximize_sum)**:
   - This function is the core of the solution, designed to maximize the sum of the array segment from `l` to `r`.
   - It first calculates the sum `s` of the segment. If `s` is less than or equal to the square of the segment length, it applies the MEX operation to the segment and updates the array and operations list.
   - If `s` is greater than the square of the segment length, it finds the maximum element in the segment and its position `pos`. It then recursively calls itself on the segments `l` to `pos - 1` and `pos + 1` to `r`.
   - This function correctly divides the problem into smaller subproblems and applies the MEX operation where necessary.

4. **Function 4 (func_3)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results.
   - It correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the output in the required format.

However, there are a few issues to consider:
- **Recursive Call in `func_2`**: The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` but does not pass the `a` and `ops` variables. This should be corrected to `recursive_maximize_sum(a, 0, n - 1, ops)`.
- **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation is not explicitly shown in the code. The function assumes that the MEX of a segment is `r - l + 1`, which is not always correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment.

Given these points, the program is not entirely correct due to the incorrect MEX calculation and the missing parameters in the recursive call.

Correctness: **False**
