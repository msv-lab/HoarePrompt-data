You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), representing the number of test cases. Each element in cases is a tuple (n, k, m, s) where n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26), k is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), m is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), and s is a string of length m comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), `cases` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to the input string, `us` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters that were added when the set `win` had all `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times all `k` unique characters were found in a contiguous subsequence of `s`).
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns it.
    #State: `t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), `cases` remains unchanged, `s` is updated to the input string, `us` remains a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the characters that were added when the set `win` had all `k` unique characters, and `ps` is the number of times the set `win` was cleared (i.e., the number of times all `k` unique characters were found in a contiguous subsequence of `s`). Additionally, `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop does not execute fully because it returns in the first iteration where `i` is not in `win`. The variable `ans` remains unchanged, `win` remains an empty set, and `ps` remains unchanged. The loop returns a string that is the concatenation of `ans`, the first character `i` from `us` that is not in `win`, and `n - len(ans) - 1` 'a' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It prints 'YES' and returns 'YES'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program prints 'YES' and returns it.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
