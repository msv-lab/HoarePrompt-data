Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, a string `s` consisting of characters '0' and '1' where 1 <= |s| <= 500, and return an integer representing the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.**

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function definition should be updated to include the necessary parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string `s` consists of characters '0' and '1' and 1 <= |s| <= 500.**
