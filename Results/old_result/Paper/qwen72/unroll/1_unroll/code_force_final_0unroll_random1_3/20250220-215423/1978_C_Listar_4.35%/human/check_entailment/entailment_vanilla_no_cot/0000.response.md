Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that affect its correctness:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The logic for constructing the permutation is flawed. The function attempts to manipulate the list `l` by moving elements around, but it does not correctly handle the construction of a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - The condition `if 1 + i > k:` is not appropriate for the problem. The correct approach should involve swapping elements in a way that achieves the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly. It should return the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` when `k` is 0.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function correctly checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`.
   - However, it returns `(0, 0)` when the permutation is not possible, which is not a suitable return type for the problem. The function should return a boolean or a specific value to indicate whether a permutation is possible or not.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function is responsible for printing the permutation. It correctly prints "YES" followed by the permutation, but it does not handle the case where no permutation is possible.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function calls `func_2` to check if a permutation is possible and then calls `func_1` to generate the permutation.
   - If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it correctly prints "NO".
   - However, the function `func_1` is not correctly generating the permutation, so even if `func_2` returns a valid `(n, k)`, the permutation generated by `func_1` may not be correct.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Check if `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
2. Construct a permutation that achieves the desired Manhattan value by swapping elements in a controlled manner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if k == 0:
        return list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    k = k // 2
    for i in range(k):
        l[i], l[n - 1 - i] = l[n - 1 - i], l[i]
    
    return l

def func_2(n, k):
    if k % 2 != 0:
        return False
    if n % 2 == 0:
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    else:
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    if k > max_k:
        return False
    return True

def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    print(' '.join(map(str, l)))

def func_4():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if not func_2(n, k):
            print('NO')
            continue
        l = func_1(n, k)
        func_3(l)

func_4()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`func_1`**: Constructs the permutation by swapping the first `k` elements with the last `k` elements. This ensures that the Manhattan value is `k`.
- **`func_2`**: Checks if `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
- **`func_3`**: Prints the permutation if it exists.
- **`func_4`**: Handles multiple test cases and calls the other functions to determine and print the permutation or "NO" if it is not possible.
