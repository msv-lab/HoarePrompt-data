Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. The given functions are unrelated to the problem and do not perform the necessary operations to achieve the desired result. For example, `func_8` and `func_9` perform multiplication operations, which are not relevant to the problem. Additionally, none of the functions handle the core logic of adding a permutation to the array and counting the maximum frequency of any element. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
