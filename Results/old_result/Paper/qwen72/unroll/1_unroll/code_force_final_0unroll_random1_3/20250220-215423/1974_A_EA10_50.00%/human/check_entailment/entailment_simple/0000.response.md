### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` is defined to solve the problem.
   - It reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens:**
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This is an attempt to determine the minimum number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 2 of the 2x2 icons (as each screen has 15 cells and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells), the formula `(y + 1) // 2` is used to ensure that if `y` is odd, an additional screen is allocated.
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This is intended to represent the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and `y * 4` cells are occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - The condition `if m < x:` checks if the remaining space on the screens is insufficient to place all 1x1 icons. If so, it calculates the additional screens needed using `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula ensures that the remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens `z` for each test case.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Variable `a` in the Condition:**
  - The condition `if m < a:` is incorrect. It should be `if m < x:` because `x` represents the number of 1x1 icons, not `a` which is the number of test cases.
- **Initial Calculation of `z`:**
  - The initial calculation of `z` as `(y + 1) // 2` is correct for determining the minimum number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons.
- **Remaining Space Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `m` as `15 * z - y * 4` is correct for determining the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
- **Additional Screens Calculation:**
  - The calculation `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` is correct for determining the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < x:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected program is used.
- **False** if the original program is used due to the incorrect condition `if m < a:`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program contains a logical error in the condition `if m < a:`. It should be `if m < x:` to correctly determine if additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
