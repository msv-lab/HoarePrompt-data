Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of cows, an integer `n` for the number of cows, and an integer `k` for the index of your cow. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the maximum number of cows that can be placed before the cow at index `k` such that their ratings are not greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. The function does not return any value but modifies and resets its internal variables for each test case, ensuring it is ready to process the next test case until all `t` test cases are completed. **
