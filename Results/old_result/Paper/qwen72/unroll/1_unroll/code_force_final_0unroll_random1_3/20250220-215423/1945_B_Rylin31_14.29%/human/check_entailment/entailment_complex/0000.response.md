### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` and performs the necessary calculations.

2. **Calculation Logic:**
   - The function calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`. This is intended to represent the time up to which we need to consider the visibility of fireworks.
   - The function then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and if `a` and `b` are not equal to 1. If this condition is true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of fireworks visible at the same time is flawed. The function should determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, not the total number of distinct moments when at least one firework is visible.
   - The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1` is not necessary and does not correctly handle the problem. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is determined by the overlap of the visibility intervals of the fireworks launched by both installations.
   - The correct approach is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and use it to determine the maximum overlap. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 + m // a + m // b - m // lcm(a, b)`.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `6 7 4`, the correct output is `2` because the first installation launches fireworks at times 6, 12, 18, etc., and the second installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, etc. The only overlap is at time 0 to 4 minutes, where one firework from each installation is visible.
   - For the input `3 4 10`, the correct output is `7` because the first installation launches fireworks at times 3, 6, 9, etc., and the second installation launches fireworks at times 4, 8, 12, etc. The maximum overlap occurs at time 12 minutes, where 7 fireworks are visible.
   - For the input `7 8 56`, the correct output is `17` because the first installation launches fireworks at times 7, 14, 21, etc., and the second installation launches fireworks at times 8, 16, 24, etc. The maximum overlap occurs at time 56 minutes, where 17 fireworks are visible.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided function does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. It incorrectly uses the condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and a != 1 and b != 1` and does not consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap. Therefore, the function is incorrect.
