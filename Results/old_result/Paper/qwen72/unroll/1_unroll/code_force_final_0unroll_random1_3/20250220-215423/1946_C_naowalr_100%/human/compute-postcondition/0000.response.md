The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0. Since the function `func_1` does not take any parameters, the state of the loop head is solely dependent on the input provided by `sys.stdin.readline()`.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
