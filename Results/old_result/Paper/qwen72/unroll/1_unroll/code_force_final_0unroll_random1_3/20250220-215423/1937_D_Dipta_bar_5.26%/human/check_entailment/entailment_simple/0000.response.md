### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s` of characters '<' and '>', which are consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell.
   - The function uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, respectively, adjusted by their positions.

3. **List `A` and `idx_A`**:
   - `A` is used to store the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions relative to the last '<' character.
   - `idx_A` stores the indices where '>' characters are found in the string `s`.
   - This part of the function correctly identifies and processes '>' characters.

4. **List `B` and `idx_B`**:
   - `B` is used to store the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions relative to the last '>' character.
   - `idx_B` stores the indices where '<' characters are found in the string `s`, in reverse order.
   - This part of the function correctly identifies and processes '<' characters.

5. **Main Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over each cell in the string `s` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex but follows the rules described in the problem:
     - If the current cell is '>', it uses the cumulative counts in `A` and `B` to determine the time.
     - If the current cell is '<', it uses the cumulative counts in `A` and `B` to determine the time.
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the pinball leaves the grid immediately or after a certain number of steps.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, with each result separated by a space, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the calculations for the pinball movements and times are consistent with the rules provided. The use of cumulative counts and adjusted positions ensures that the program can efficiently compute the required times for each cell.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
