The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`sa` contains the row indices where there is at least one 'F' transition and no 'S' transitions, `sb` contains the column indices where there is at least one 'S' transition and no 'F' transitions, `n` must be greater than 0, `xx` remains unchanged, `i` is 1**
