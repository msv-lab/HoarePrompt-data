Initial State: `a` and `b` are integers where `b >= 0`, and `b` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `a` is less than `b`.

```
c, d = func_1(b, a)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

- The function `func_1` is called with arguments `b` and `a`.
- The function `func_1` returns two values, which are assigned to `c` and `d`.
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Since the specific implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers where `b >= 0`, and `b` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `a` is less than `b`. `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
