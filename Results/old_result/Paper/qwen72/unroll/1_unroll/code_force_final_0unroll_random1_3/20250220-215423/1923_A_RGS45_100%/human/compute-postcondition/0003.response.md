The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (each either 0 or 1) representing the state of each cell. Here, 0 indicates a free cell, and 1 indicates a cell containing a chip. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each test case contains a chip.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell in a ribbon. It returns the state of the ribbon based on the positions of the chips.**
