Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of `arr`, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `start` is now explicitly set to 0.
