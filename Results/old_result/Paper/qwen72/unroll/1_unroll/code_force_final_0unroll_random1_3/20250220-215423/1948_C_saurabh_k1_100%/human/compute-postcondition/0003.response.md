Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of arrows (each string has exactly `n` characters and consists only of '<' and '>') representing the first and second rows of the grid for each test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to navigate from the leftmost column to the rightmost column in the grid for each test case. If `t` is out of the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, or any `n` is out of the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, or `n` is not even, or the sum of all `n` values exceeds 2 · 10^5, the function's behavior is undefined.**
