### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose well.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**:
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the array to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \), \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, the implementation of the operation is incorrect. The lines:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
     This is because the operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by multiples of \( a_{i-1} \).

4. **Correctness of the Operation**:
   - The operation should be applied in a way that ensures the array can be reduced to all zeros if possible.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` will not work correctly because it incorrectly modifies the array elements by multiples of \( a_{i-1} \).

5. **Additional Considerations**:
   - The problem requires that the sum of the elements in the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero. This is because each operation reduces the sum of the array by 4.
   - The current implementation does not check this condition, which is a necessary step to determine the feasibility of making all elements zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the incorrect implementation of the operation in `func_2` and the lack of a necessary condition check. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(list, n):
    # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
    if sum(list) % 4 != 0:
        print('NO')
        return
    
    # Apply the operation to try to make all elements zero
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1
            list[i] -= 2
            list[i + 1] -= 1
    
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

# Example usage
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

for n, list in test_cases:
    func_2(list, n)
```

This corrected version includes the necessary sum check and correctly applies the operation.
