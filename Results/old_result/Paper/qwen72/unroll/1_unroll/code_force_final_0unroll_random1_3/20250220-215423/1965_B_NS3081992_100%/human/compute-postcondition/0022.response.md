Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n, `b` is a binary string representing `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1). Otherwise, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged, `bk` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and the new last element is `2 * k + 1`, and additional elements from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), `lk` remains unchanged.***
