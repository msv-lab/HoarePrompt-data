### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points.
   - It initializes `ad` and `bd` lists to store the distances and time differences between consecutive known points.
   - It initializes `v` to store the speeds between consecutive known points.

2. **Speed Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the distances between consecutive points and stores them in `ad`.
   - It correctly calculates the time differences between consecutive points and stores them in `bd`.
   - It calculates the speeds between consecutive points and stores them in `v`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the index `s` of the first known point that is greater than or equal to the query point `ql`.
   - If the query point `ql` is exactly at a known point `a[s]`, it directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - If the query point `ql` is not at a known point, it calculates the time to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the distance to the previous known point `a[s-1]` from `ql`.
     - Adding the time to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]` to the time it takes to travel the remaining distance at the speed between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Indexing in `bisect_left`:**
  - The program uses `bisect_left` on the list `a` which includes the initial point 0. This is correct because `a` is strictly increasing and includes 0.
  - The index `s` returned by `bisect_left` is always valid because `a` is guaranteed to be strictly increasing and includes the final point `n`.

- **Speed Calculation:**
  - The speed calculation `v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])` is correct. It calculates the speed between each pair of consecutive points.

- **Time Calculation:**
  - The time calculation `m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]` is correct. It correctly calculates the time to travel the remaining distance after subtracting the distance to the previous known point `a[s-1]`.
  - The use of `int(m)` ensures that the time is rounded down to the nearest integer.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the query point `ql` is exactly at a known point `a[s]` by directly printing `b[s]`.
  - The program also handles the edge case where `ql` is 0 by correctly printing 0 (since `a[0]` is 0 and `b[0]` is 0).

- **Boundary Conditions:**
  - The program ensures that the index `s` is within the bounds of the lists `a` and `b` by using `bisect_left` and adjusting `ql` accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly parses the input, calculates the speeds, and processes the queries to output the time taken to reach each query point, rounded down to the nearest integer. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:

Final: **True**
