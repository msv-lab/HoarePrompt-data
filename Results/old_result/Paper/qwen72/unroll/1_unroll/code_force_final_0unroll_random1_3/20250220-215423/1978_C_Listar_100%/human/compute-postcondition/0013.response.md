The function `func_4` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates with two integers `n` and `k` where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k`:

- Case_1: The function returns (0, 0).
- Case_2: The function returns 0, 0.
- Case_3: The function returns the integer `n` and the even integer `k`, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n`.

Functionality: **The function `func_4` returns (0, 0) or 0, 0 in some cases. In another case, it returns the integer `n` and the even integer `k` where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, provided that `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is (n^2 - 1) // 2; if `n` is even, `max_k` is `n`.**
