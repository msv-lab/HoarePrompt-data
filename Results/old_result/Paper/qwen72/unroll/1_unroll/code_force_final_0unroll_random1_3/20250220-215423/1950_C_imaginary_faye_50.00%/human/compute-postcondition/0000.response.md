The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the range object created from the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by the input, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440). The variable `t` in the loop head will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer within the specified range. The variable `t` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop, and the input must be a positive integer to ensure the loop runs at least once.

State: **`t` is 0, the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440)**
