Postcondition: **`tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of all the nodes directly connected to it by an edge. `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. `leaves` is a list of all nodes in `tree` that have exactly one connection. `dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to the first node in `leaves`, and `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to the second node in `leaves`. At least one of `dist1` or `dist2` is an odd number.**
