### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input, which are the number of integers and the target sum, respectively.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - The function iterates through the bits of `k` to identify the positions of the 1s in its binary representation. This is done using the bitwise AND operation (`k & 1`) and right shift (`k >> 1`).
   - The positions of the 1s are stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The function then constructs the sequence `ans` by setting the elements to powers of 2 corresponding to the positions in `arr`.
   - The loop ensures that the sequence `ans` is filled with powers of 2 until it reaches the last element, where the remaining sum is added to ensure the total sum equals `k`.
   - If the sequence `ans` is shorter than `n`, the remaining elements are filled with zeros.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sequence `ans` for each test case, ensuring that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n` is 1 by directly printing `k`.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is greater than the number of 1s in the binary representation of `k` by filling the remaining positions with zeros.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It ensures that the sum of the elements in the sequence equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the elements. The function handles multiple test cases and edge cases appropriately.
