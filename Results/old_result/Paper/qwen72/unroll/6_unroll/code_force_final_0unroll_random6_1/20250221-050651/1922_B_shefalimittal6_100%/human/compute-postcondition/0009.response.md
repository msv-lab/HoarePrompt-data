The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the exponents of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}), and `n` represents the number of sticks. The function also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `a` and `n`.

- Case_1: If the sum of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}) for all `i` in the list `a` can form a square, the function returns "Yes".
- Case_2: If the sum of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}) for all `i` in the list `a` cannot form a square, the function returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns "Yes" if the sum of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}) can form a square, and "No" otherwise.**
