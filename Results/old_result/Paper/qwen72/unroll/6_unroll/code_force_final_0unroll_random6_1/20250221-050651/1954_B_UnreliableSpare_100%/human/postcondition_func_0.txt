The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input. It checks if all elements in `arr` are equal. If they are, it prints `-1`. If not, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of `arr` and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the code provided does not explicitly manage the test cases or validate input constraints.
