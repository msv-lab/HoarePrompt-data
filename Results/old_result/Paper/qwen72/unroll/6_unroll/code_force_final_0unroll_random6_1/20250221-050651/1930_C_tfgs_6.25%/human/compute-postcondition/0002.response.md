The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop. The state of `t` and `test_cases` are not relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
