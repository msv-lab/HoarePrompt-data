Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the list of multipliers \( k \).

2. **Calculation of \( m \)**:
   - The program calculates \( m \) as the product of all multipliers \( k_i \). This is done to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the coins.

3. **Calculation of Initial Bets**:
   - The program then calculates the initial bets \( c_i \) as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \). This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \).

4. **Finding the GCD**:
   - The program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial bets \( c \) using the function `func_1`.

5. **Normalization of Bets**:
   - The program normalizes the bets by dividing each \( c_i \) by the GCD \( hcf \).

6. **Check for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) is strictly less than \( \frac{m}{hcf} \). If this condition is not met, it prints \(-1\).

7. **Output**:
   - If the condition is met, the program prints the normalized bets.

The key issue identified in the original assessment is that the program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. Let's analyze why:

- **Case with All Multipliers the Same**:
  - If all \( k_i \) are the same, say \( k \), then \( m = k^n \).
  - Each initial bet \( c_i \) will be \( \frac{k^n}{k} = k^{n-1} \).
  - The GCD of all \( c_i \) will be \( k^{n-1} \).
  - The normalized bets will all be \( \frac{k^{n-1}}{k^{n-1}} = 1 \).
  - The sum of the normalized bets will be \( n \).
  - The total amount of coins received back for any winning outcome will be \( k \times 1 = k \).
  - Since \( n \ge k \) (because \( k \ge 2 \) and \( n \ge 1 \)), the condition \( n < k \) will never be satisfied, and the program should output \(-1\).

However, the program does not correctly identify this case and outputs \( 1 \) for each bet, which is incorrect.

**Conclusion**:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where all multipliers are the same correctly, and it should output \(-1\) in such cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
