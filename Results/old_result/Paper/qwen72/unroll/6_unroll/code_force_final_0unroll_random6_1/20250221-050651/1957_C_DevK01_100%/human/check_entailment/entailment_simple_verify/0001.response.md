### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of remaining valid positions on the board.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The state of the program right before the function call is correctly described. `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it means the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which is a different position. Therefore, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
   - If `a == b`, the computer skips its turn, and only one position `(a, a)` is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is correctly implemented. The state of `n` after processing the moves is accurately described.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, representing the base cases where there is 1 way to place 0 rooks and 1 way to place 1 rook.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the DP array is updated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place `i` rooks on an `i x i` board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place `i-1` rooks and leave one row and one column free.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in one of the `i-1` free rows and columns, and then place the remaining `i-2` rooks in the remaining `i-2` rows and columns.
   - **Annotation Verification:** The state of `dp` after each iteration is correctly described as a list with values `[dp[n-1], dp[n]]`. The final return value is `dp[n]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - **Annotation Verification:** The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. The input handling, move processing, dynamic programming, and output are all accurate and consistent with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
