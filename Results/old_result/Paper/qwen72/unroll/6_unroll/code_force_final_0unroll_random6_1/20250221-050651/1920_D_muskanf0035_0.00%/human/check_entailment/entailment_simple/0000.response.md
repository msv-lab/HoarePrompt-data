Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of constructing an array based on a series of operations and then answering queries about the elements at specific positions in the array. However, there is a significant issue with the way the array is constructed during the second type of operation (b=2).

1. **First Operation (b=1):** This operation appends a single integer `x` to the array, which is correctly implemented in the `func_1` function.

2. **Second Operation (b=2):** This operation is supposed to append `x` copies of the current array to itself. The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly handle this operation. Specifically, the line:
   ```python
   array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
   ```
   This line only appends one copy of the current array to itself, regardless of the value of `x`. To correctly implement this operation, the array should be extended by `x` copies of itself, which can be done using:
   ```python
   array.extend(array * (value - 1))
   ```

3. **Query Handling:** The query handling part of the `func_1` function is correct. It uses the modulo operation to handle queries efficiently, which is necessary because the array can become very large.

4. **Input and Output Handling:** The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case, printing the results as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because the second type of operation does not append `x` copies of the array as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
