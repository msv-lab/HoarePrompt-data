Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw that affects its correctness. The program reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then iterates over each test case. However, the program only processes the last test case and prints the result based on the final values of `a` and `b`. This is because the `if` statement that checks the sum of `a` and `b` is outside the loop, so it only executes once after the loop has completed. This means that the program will not correctly handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

Additionally, the output format is incorrect. The program should print "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces. The current implementation prints "bob  " and "alice" with trailing spaces, which does not match the expected output format.

To fix these issues, the `if` statement should be moved inside the loop, and the output should be formatted correctly.

Correctness: **False**
