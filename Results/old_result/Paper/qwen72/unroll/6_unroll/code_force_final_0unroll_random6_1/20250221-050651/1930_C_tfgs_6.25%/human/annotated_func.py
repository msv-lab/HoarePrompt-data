#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: The list `a` will have each of its elements increased by the corresponding index plus one. The integer `n` and the other variables in the initial state (`t` and `test_cases`) remain unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, each element is unique, and without duplicates. The integer `n` and the other variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of the elements in the updated list `a`, but all counts are now zero. `cnt` is equal to 0. `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional numbers inserted between the elements of `a` such that the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 1, and the total number of elements in `ans` is equal to `n`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: The list `a` remains sorted in descending order, each element is unique, and without duplicates. The integer `n` and the other variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of the elements in the updated list `a`, but all counts are now zero. `cnt` is equal to 0. `ans` is a list that contains the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional numbers inserted between the elements of `a` such that the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 1, and the total number of elements in `ans` is equal to `n`. Since `cnt` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [elements of `a` in descending order, with additional numbers inserted to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 1, and the total number of elements is equal to `n`]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. It then ensures that the modified list `a` contains unique elements, sorts it in descending order, and constructs a new list `ans` that maintains the unique elements of `a` in descending order while inserting additional numbers between these elements to ensure that the difference between consecutive elements is at least 1. The final list `ans` has a length equal to `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` and does not return any value. The variables `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function.
