The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` from the input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. It then calculates an integer value `ans` based on the inputs `n` and `m` using a loop that iterates while `count` is less than or equal to `m`. The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n`, `m`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` are reset for each test case.
