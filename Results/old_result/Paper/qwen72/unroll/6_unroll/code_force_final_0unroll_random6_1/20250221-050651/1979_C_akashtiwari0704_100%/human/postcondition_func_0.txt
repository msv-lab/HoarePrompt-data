The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list, transforms each integer by dividing the LCM by the integer, and sums these transformed values. If the sum of the transformed values is greater than or equal to the LCM, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated list of the transformed values. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has completed all iterations.
