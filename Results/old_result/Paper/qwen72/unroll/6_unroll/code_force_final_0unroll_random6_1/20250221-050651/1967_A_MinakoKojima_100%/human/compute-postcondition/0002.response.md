Output State: **`ans_list` is a list containing the results of the loop for each test case, where each result is an integer representing the final value of `ans` after processing the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not retained after the loop completes, as they are re-initialized for each test case.**
