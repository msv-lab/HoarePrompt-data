Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem of calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation in the program does not correctly follow the logic required to solve this problem.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The program calculates `x` using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
   - This formula does not correctly represent the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The formula seems to be derived from a different problem or a misunderstanding of the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Adding to `suma`:**
   - The program checks if `x` is greater than 0 and adds it to `suma`. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement.
   - Additionally, the program checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2 == 0\) and adds 1 to `suma` if both conditions are true. This condition is also incorrect and does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

3. **Subtracting 2 from `suma`:**
   - The program prints `suma - 2` for each test case. This subtraction is not justified by the problem statement and seems arbitrary.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
- Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
- For each pair \((a, b)\), check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of such pairs and print the count for each test case.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        n, m = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The calculation of `x` and the conditions for adding to `suma` are incorrect, and the final subtraction of 2 is not justified.

Correctness: **False**
