The value of `t` is assigned the integer value input by the user. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, k, a, x). `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, `a` is a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9, and `x` is a list of n integers, each between -n and n, with the constraint that x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
