### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `x` is divisible by `i`.
   - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it appends both `i` and `x // i` to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - Finally, it reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to get all divisors in a single list.
   - This function is correct and efficiently finds all divisors of `x`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program is to determine the possible values of `k` that fit the given constraints.
   - The program considers two cases:
     - **Case 1:** `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`
     - **Case 2:** `(n - x) % 2 == 0`
   - For each case, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of the respective value.
   - It then checks if each divisor `s` plus 2 is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to the `output` list.
   - After processing both cases, it converts the `output` list to a set to remove duplicates and prints the length of the set.

4. **Constraints and Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).
   - It ensures that `k` is a natural number greater than 1 by checking if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program outputs the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints. It handles the input and output correctly, and the main logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
