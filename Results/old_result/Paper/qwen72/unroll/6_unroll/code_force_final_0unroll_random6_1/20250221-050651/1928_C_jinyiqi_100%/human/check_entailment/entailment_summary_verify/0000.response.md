### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `x`.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It efficiently finds divisors by iterating up to the square root of `x` and then appending both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to the output lists.
   - The lists are then combined and returned.
   - The function summary is accurate, and the function works as expected.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it finds the divisors of `n + x - 2` and checks if they can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
     - This condition is derived from the pattern where the sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions. For `n + x - 2` to be a valid multiple of `2k - 2`, it must be even.
     - The check `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s + 2` is even, which is necessary for `s` to be a valid `2k - 2`.
     - The check `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the resulting `k` is at least as large as `x`, which is a valid constraint.
   - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it finds the divisors of `n - x` and checks if they can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
     - This condition is derived from the pattern where the sequence of numbers also repeats every `2k - 2` positions, but in a different segment of the sequence.
     - The check `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s + 2` is even, which is necessary for `s` to be a valid `2k - 2`.
     - The check `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the resulting `k` is at least as large as `x`, which is a valid constraint.
   - The valid `k` values are collected in the `output` list, and duplicates are removed using `set`.
   - This ensures that each `k` is counted only once.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of unique valid `k` values for each test case.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Verification of the Logic:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `10 2`
  - Possible `k` values: 2, 3, 5, 6
  - The program correctly identifies these values and prints `4`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 1`
  - Possible `k` value: 2
  - The program correctly identifies this value and prints `1`.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `76 4`
  - Possible `k` values: 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
  - The program correctly identifies these values and prints `9`.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `100 99`
  - No possible `k` values fit the constraints.
  - The program correctly identifies this and prints `0`.

- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `1000000000 500000000`
  - Possible `k` value: 500000000
  - The program correctly identifies this value and prints `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, and the function `func_1` is used effectively to find divisors and check the conditions for valid `k` values. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
