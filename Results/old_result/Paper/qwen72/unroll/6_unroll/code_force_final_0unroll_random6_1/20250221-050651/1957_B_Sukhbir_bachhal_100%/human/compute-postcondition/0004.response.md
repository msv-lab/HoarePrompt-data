The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `position`, but the condition for the loop to execute is solely dependent on `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is not equal to 0. Given that the state right before the loop indicates `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0, the condition for the loop to execute is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**
