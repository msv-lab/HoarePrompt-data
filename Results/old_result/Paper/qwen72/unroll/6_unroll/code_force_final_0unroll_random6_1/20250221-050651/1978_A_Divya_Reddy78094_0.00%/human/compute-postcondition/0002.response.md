Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It will sort `nums` in descending order and print the sum of the two largest numbers in `nums`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `nums` will be undefined or reset for the next iteration, and any other variables not affected by the loop will remain unchanged.**
