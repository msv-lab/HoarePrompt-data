### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is the bet amount on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.

2. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - Let `x_i` be the bet amount on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - For the i-th outcome to be winning, the amount received back should be `k_i * x_i`, and this should be greater than `sum(x_i)` for all `i`.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The LCM is used to find a common multiple for all `k_i` values.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier.
     - It iterates through all multipliers and updates `den` to be the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
     - It then calculates `vprod` as the list of values `den // r` for each multiplier `r`.
     - It checks if `den - sum(vprod)` is less than or equal to zero. If it is, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
     - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - **LCM Calculation:** The LCM of all `k_i` values is used to ensure that the distribution of coins is such that the total amount bet is a common multiple of all `k_i` values. This ensures that the total amount bet is a multiple of each `k_i`, which is a good starting point.
   - **Distribution Calculation:** The values `vprod` are calculated as `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This ensures that the amount received back for each outcome is `k_i * (den // k_i) = den`, which is the same for all outcomes.
   - **Condition Check:** The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. If this condition is not met, it prints `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Outcome:** If there is only one outcome, the LCM is the outcome itself, and the condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` will always be true because `den` is greater than `den // r`.
   - **Multiple Outcomes with the Same Multiplier:** If all multipliers are the same, the LCM will be that multiplier, and the condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` will be true if the multiplier is greater than 1.
   - **Multiple Outcomes with Different Multipliers:** The LCM of different multipliers ensures that the total amount bet is a common multiple, and the condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers and distributes the coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The condition check ensures that the solution is valid or prints `-1` if no valid distribution exists.

**Correctness: True**
