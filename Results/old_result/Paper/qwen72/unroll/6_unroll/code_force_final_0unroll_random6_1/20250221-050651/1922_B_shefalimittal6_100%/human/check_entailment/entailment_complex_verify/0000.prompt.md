You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}), and an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 \le a_i \le n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length for each test case. Each test case consists of a list of integers representing the exponents of stick lengths (2^{a_i}), and the function outputs the results for each test case on a new line. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the formation of non-degenerate triangles from the given sticks. The logic in the program only counts the number of ways to choose three sticks of the same length or two sticks of the same length and one different stick. However, it does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for any three sides to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1 = 2\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^3 = 8\), and \(2^4 = 16\). According to the problem description, no three of these sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is not greater than the length of the third stick. However, the program will incorrectly count some combinations as valid, leading to an incorrect result.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Count the number of sticks of each length.
2. Use the triangle inequality theorem to determine valid combinations of three sticks.
3. Calculate the number of valid combinations and return the result.

The current program fails to implement the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining the validity of the triangles. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
