The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the size of the list `a` and a specific integer value, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs for `t` test cases, each with a list of `n` integers and an integer `k`, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
