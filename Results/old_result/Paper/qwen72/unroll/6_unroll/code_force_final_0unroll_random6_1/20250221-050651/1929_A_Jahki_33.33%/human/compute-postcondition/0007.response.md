The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `num2`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 2 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^9. `num2` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a value between 1 and 500. The function returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` (where 2 <= len(a) <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9) and an integer `num2` (where 1 <= num2 <= 500). It returns `True` in one case and `False` in another case.**
