Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the second type of operation (b=2). According to the problem description, when Jayden performs an operation of type 2 with a value x, he should append x copies of the current array to itself. However, the program in `func_1` only appends one copy of the array, regardless of the value of x. This will lead to incorrect results for test cases where the second type of operation is used with x > 1.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            current_array = array[:]
            for _ in range(value - 1):
                array.extend(current_array)
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result
```

This version correctly handles the second type of operation by appending x copies of the current array to itself. The rest of the program (`func_2`) remains unchanged and should work correctly with this updated `func_1`.
