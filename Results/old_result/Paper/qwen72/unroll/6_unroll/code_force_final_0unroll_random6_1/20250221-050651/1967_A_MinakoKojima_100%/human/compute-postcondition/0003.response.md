The only object in the loop head is the variable `a` and the list `ans_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ans_list`. If the list has at least one element, the loop will execute. For the loop to be executed, `ans_list` must have at least one element, and `a` will be the first element in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`ans_list` is a list containing the results of the loop for each test case, and it must have at least one element, `a` is the first element in the `ans_list`**
