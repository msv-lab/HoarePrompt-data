### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Calls:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads `n` rows of the river grid, where each row is a list of `m` integers, with the first and last elements being 0 (representing the river banks).
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` with the row and `d` as arguments. The result of `func_1` is appended to the `costs` list.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It starts by setting `row[0]` to 1 (since the cost of installing a support in the first cell is always 1).
   - It then iterates over the first `d` cells and adds 2 to each cell's depth (this accounts for the cost of installing a support and the +1 cost).
   - A min-heap is created with the first `d` elements of the row, along with their indices.
   - For each subsequent cell in the row, it ensures that the distance between the current cell and the nearest support (from the heap) is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then calculates the cost of installing a support in the current cell by adding the cost of the nearest support (from the heap) to the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - The current cell's cost is pushed back into the heap, and the process continues until all cells are processed.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which is the total cost of installing supports for the row.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - After calculating the cost for each row using `func_1`, `func_2` creates a list `total_costs` that contains the sum of costs for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It then prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using a min-heap to ensure that the distance condition is met.
   - The use of the min-heap ensures that the cost is minimized by always choosing the nearest support that is within the allowed distance `d`.
   - The calculation of the total cost for `k` consecutive rows is also correct, as it sums the costs of the selected rows and finds the minimum sum.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by simply returning the cost of the single row.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` by summing the costs of all rows.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The complexity of `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\) due to the heap operations.
   - The complexity of `func_2` is \(O(n \cdot m \log d)\) for processing all rows and \(O(n - k + 1)\) for finding the minimum sum of `k` consecutive rows.
   - These complexities are efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. It correctly calculates the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive rows of the river grid.

**Correctness: **True****
