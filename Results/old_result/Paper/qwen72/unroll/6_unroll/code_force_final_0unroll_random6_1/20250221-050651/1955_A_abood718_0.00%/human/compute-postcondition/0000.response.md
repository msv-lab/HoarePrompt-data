The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted explicitly. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
