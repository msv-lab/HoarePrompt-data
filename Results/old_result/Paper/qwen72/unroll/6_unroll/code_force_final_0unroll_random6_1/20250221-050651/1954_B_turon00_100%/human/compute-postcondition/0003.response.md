Output State: **The loop completes its execution, and for each test case, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array, or -1 if the array has only one element or all elements are the same. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are no longer in use after the loop finishes.**
