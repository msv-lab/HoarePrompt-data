You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer n .

Find a permutation^\dagger p of length n such that there do not exist two
distinct indices i and j (1 \leq i, j < n ; i \neq j ) such that p_i divides
p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1} .

Refer to the Notes section for some examples.

Under the constraints of this problem, it can be proven that at least one p
exists.

^\dagger A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \leq n \leq
10^5 ) — the length of the permutation p .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Example

Input

    2
    
    4
    
    3

Output

    4 1 2 3
    1 2 3
    
Note

In the first test case, p=[4,1,2,3] is a valid permutation. However, the
permutation p=[1,2,3,4] is not a valid permutation as we can choose i=1 and
j=3 . Then p_1=1 divides p_3=3 and p_2=2 divides p_4=4 . Note that the
permutation p=[3, 4, 2, 1] is also not a valid permutation as we can choose
i=3 and j=2 . Then p_3=2 divides p_2=4 and p_4=1 divides p_3=2 .

In the second test case, p=[1,2,3] is a valid permutation. In fact, all 6
permutations of length 3 are valid.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))
    a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]
    print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from user input, creates a list of integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), reverses the elements at even indices, and prints the modified list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the list is printed in the format [n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 3, n-1, 1], where elements at even indices are in reverse order and elements at odd indices remain in their original positions. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and generates a list \( a \) containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list \( a \).
   - Finally, it prints the modified list \( a \).

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - The permutation \( a \) is generated as a list of integers from 1 to \( n \), which is a valid permutation.
   - The key operation is reversing the elements at even indices. This operation ensures that the permutation is altered in a way that avoids the condition \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

4. **Avoiding the Condition**:
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the relative order of elements at even indices is changed. This change helps in breaking any potential patterns where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
   - For example, if \( n = 4 \), the initial list is \( [1, 2, 3, 4] \). Reversing the elements at even indices results in \( [3, 2, 1, 4] \). This permutation does not have any \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \( 3 \leq n \leq 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^3 \).
   - The permutation is always valid because it contains all integers from 1 to \( n \) exactly once.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( n = 4 \), the output is \( [3, 2, 1, 4] \), which is a valid permutation.
   - For \( n = 3 \), the output is \( [1, 2, 3] \), which is also a valid permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
