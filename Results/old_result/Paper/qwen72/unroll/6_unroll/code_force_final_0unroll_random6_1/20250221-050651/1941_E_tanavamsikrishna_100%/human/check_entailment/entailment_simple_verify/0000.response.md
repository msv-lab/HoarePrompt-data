### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and its annotations to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`
- **Initial State**: `row` is a list of integers where `row[0]` and `row[-1]` are 0, and `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le d < \text{len(row)}\).
- **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
  1. `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support to 1.
  2. `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This adds 2 to the cost of each cell from index 1 to \(d-1\). This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual cost of installing supports, which should be \(a_{i,j} + 1\).
  3. `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This initializes a min-heap with the first `d` elements of the row.
  4. `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a min-heap.
  5. `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This loop processes the rest of the row.
     - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This ensures that the heap only contains elements within the sliding window of size \(d + 2\).
     - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and 1. This is incorrect because it does not ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less.
     - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This pushes the element back into the heap.
     - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This pushes the updated cost of the current cell into the heap.
  6. `return row[-1]`: This returns the cost of the last support.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Initial State**: No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function reads input values where `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\), \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le d \le m\). `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers where the first and last integers in each row are 0, representing the river banks.
- **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
  1. `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This reads the input values.
  2. `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This reads the grid of river depths.
  3. `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the cost of building a bridge on each row using `func_1`.
  4. `total_costs = []`: This initializes a list to store the total costs of building `k` consecutive bridges.
  5. `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`: This loop calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
     - `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This appends the sum of the costs for the current set of `k` rows to `total_costs`.
  6. `print(min(total_costs))`: This prints the minimum total cost.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation in `func_1`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` incorrectly adds 2 to the cost of each cell from index 1 to \(d-1\). The correct cost should be \(a_{i,j} + 1\).
   - The update `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1` does not ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less. It only considers the minimum cost within a sliding window of size \(d + 2\).

2. **Enforcing the Distance Condition**:
   - The program does not enforce the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. This can lead to incorrect results, as noted in the original assessment.

### Example to Validate the Issue:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 3 0
```
- The correct output should be `6` because supports must be placed in every cell due to `d = 1`.
- The program will output a different value because it does not correctly enforce the distance condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the installation of supports for the bridge, specifically in `func_1`. The function does not ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
