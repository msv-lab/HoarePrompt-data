Output State: **`dp` is a list with values [dp[n-1], dp[n]].** 

Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the list `dp` will contain only the last two elements that were computed, which are `dp[n-1]` and `dp[n]`. Each element in `dp` is computed based on the previous two elements, and the list is updated by appending a new value and removing the first value in each iteration. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `dp` will have the last two computed values.
