You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to stdout.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0. For the last string processed, if the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is greater than the number of 'B' characters (`bc`), then 'A' is the most frequent character and has been output to stdout. Otherwise, 'B' is the most frequent character or both 'A' and 'B' are equally frequent, and 'B' has been output to stdout.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks should be indented to be inside the for loop that iterates over the test cases. As it stands, the program will only print the result for the last test case, and not for all test cases as required by the problem description. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This corrected version will print the result for each test case, as specified in the problem description.
