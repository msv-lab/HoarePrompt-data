The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from user input. It modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. It then ensures that the modified list `a` contains unique elements, sorts it in descending order, and constructs a new list `ans` that maintains the unique elements of `a` in descending order while inserting additional numbers between these elements to ensure that the difference between consecutive elements is at least 1. The final list `ans` has a length equal to `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` and does not return any value. The variables `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function.
