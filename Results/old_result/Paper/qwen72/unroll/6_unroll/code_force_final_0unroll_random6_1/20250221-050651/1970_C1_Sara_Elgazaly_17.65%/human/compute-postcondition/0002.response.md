The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `x - 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value, which means `x - 1` must be greater than 0. This implies that `x` must be at least 2. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, so it doesn't need to be adjusted specifically, but it will start from 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user input and must be at least 2, `y` is an integer provided by the user input, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, `_` is 0**
