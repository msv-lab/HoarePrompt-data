### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for the 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`) and the 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).
   - The total space required for all icons is `total_space = space_y + space_x`.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program determines the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, the program calculates:
     - If `y` is even, the number of screens required is `y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons: `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.

5. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` gives the number of cells still needed.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + (extra_space % 15 > 0)` calculates the additional screens required. If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, it divides by 15. Otherwise, it adds one more screen to account for the remaining cells.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
- It then correctly calculates the remaining cells available on those screens.
- If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons, it correctly appends the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
- If the remaining cells are not sufficient, it correctly calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons and appends the total number of screens.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle all the cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
