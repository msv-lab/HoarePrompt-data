Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then checks if `n` equals `k`, and if so, prints 'YES' followed by two lines, each containing the number 1. If `n` does not equal `k` but `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by two lines: the first line contains `n - k + 1`, and the second line contains 1. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, and the value of `t` is 0. **
