Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This formula does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not relevant to the problem. The second part of the condition, `i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0`, is always false for \(i > 1\) because \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is not divisible by \(i^2\) for \(i > 1\).

3. **Incorrect Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not justified by the problem statement. This subtraction is likely a mistake and does not align with the required output.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you should:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
