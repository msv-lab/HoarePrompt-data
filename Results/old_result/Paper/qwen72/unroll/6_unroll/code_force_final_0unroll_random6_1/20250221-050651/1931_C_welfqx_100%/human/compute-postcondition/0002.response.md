Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it a palindrome. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` (the array) are not directly modified by the loop, but the internal variables used within the loop (such as `f`, `num`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2`) are reset and used for each test case. After all iterations, the initial state of `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged, but the loop has printed the required output for each test case.**
