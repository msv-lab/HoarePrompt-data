To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant variables step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `flag` remains unchanged and is `False`.
   - `ans` is the minimum of the initial `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the list `arr`.
   - The values of `i`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `flag`: This variable is `False` and remains unchanged.
   - `ans`: This variable is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `cnt`.
   - `cnt`: This variable is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the list `arr`.
   - `arr`: This is a list whose values remain unchanged.
   - `val`: This is a value that is used to count consecutive elements at the end of `arr`.

3. **Determine the Value of `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `val` at the end of the list `arr`.
   - For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 3, 3]` and `val = 3`, then `cnt` would be 3 because there are three consecutive 3s at the end of the list.

4. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated to the minimum of its initial value and `cnt`.
   - For example, if the initial `ans` is 5 and `cnt` is 3, then `ans` will be updated to 3.
   - If the initial `ans` is 2 and `cnt` is 3, then `ans` will remain 2.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `val` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `cnt`. However, we can describe the value of `ans` based on the given information.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum of the initial value of ans and the count of consecutive elements equal to val at the end of the list arr)**
