The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly used in the loop head, but it represents the number of test cases, which is what `int(input())` is expected to provide. Therefore, `t` should be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0.**
