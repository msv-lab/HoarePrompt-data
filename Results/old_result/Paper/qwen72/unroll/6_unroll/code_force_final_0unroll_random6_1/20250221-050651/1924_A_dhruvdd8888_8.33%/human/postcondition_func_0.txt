The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by a string `s`. It then processes `s` to find sequences of `k` unique characters and counts how many such sequences it can form (`ps`). If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string by appending a character from the set of the first `k` lowercase letters that is not in the current sequence, followed by `n - ps - 1` 'a' characters, and prints this string. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, and `us` remain unchanged, `win` is an empty set, and `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`.
