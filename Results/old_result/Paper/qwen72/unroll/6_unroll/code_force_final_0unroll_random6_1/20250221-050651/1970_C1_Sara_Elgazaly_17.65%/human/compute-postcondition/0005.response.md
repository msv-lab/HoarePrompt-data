To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `lst[x] != []`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head condition depends on `lst[x]`.

2. **Understand the Condition:**
   - The loop will execute if `lst[x]` is not an empty list.
   - Therefore, `lst[x]` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute the first time.

3. **Current State:**
   - `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values.
   - Each key in `lst` has had `x - 1` pairs of integers appended to its list.
   - Each pair `(a, b)` is appended to both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]`.

4. **Determine the Minimum Requirement:**
   - For `lst[x]` to be non-empty, at least one pair `(a, b)` must have been appended to `lst[x]`.
   - Since `x - 1` pairs are appended to each key, `x` must be at least 2 for `lst[x]` to have at least one pair.

### Conclusion:
- The state of `x` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lst[x]` is not an empty list.
- Given that `x - 1` pairs are appended to `lst[x]`, `x` must be at least 2.

### Final State:
State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u1 ≤ n, `x` is an integer provided by the user input and `x` must be at least 2, `y` is an integer provided by the user input, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values, where each key in `lst` has had `x - 1` pairs of integers appended to its list, with each pair `(a, b)` being appended to both `lst[a]` and `lst[b]`, `s` is True.**
