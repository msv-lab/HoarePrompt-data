The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 0. Before the loop starts, `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `arr`, and the length of `freq` is `n + 1`. `cou` is 0, but this does not affect the loop's execution. For the loop to execute, `i` should start at 0 and `n` must be non-negative.

State: **`freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of occurrences of the integer `i` in the list `arr`, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be non-negative**
