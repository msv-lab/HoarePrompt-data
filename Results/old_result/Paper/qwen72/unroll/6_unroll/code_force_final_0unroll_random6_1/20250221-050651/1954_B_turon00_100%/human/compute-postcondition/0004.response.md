The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), forming a beautiful array. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and outputs the result to the standard output.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers forming a beautiful array. It processes each test case and outputs the result to standard output.**
