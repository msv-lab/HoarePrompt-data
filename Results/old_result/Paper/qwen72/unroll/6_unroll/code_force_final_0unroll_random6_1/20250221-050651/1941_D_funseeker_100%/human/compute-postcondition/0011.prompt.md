You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set containing all integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` (from the last call of `func_1`) to the initial value `x`, modulo `n`, after `m` iterations. The size of `ans` can vary depending on the values of `r` and `c` from each call of `func_1`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`ans` is a set containing all integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` to the initial value `x`, modulo `n`, after `m` iterations. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes `n` and excludes `0`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique elements in the set `ans` after the described modifications.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the operations, the output will be the length of the set `ans` after the modifications. Since the exact values of `x`, `r`, `n`, and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical length of `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.
    #
    #Output:
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted elements of `ans` (where `ans` is a set of integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` to `x`, modulo `n`, after `m` iterations, and if `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n, and returns a value based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
