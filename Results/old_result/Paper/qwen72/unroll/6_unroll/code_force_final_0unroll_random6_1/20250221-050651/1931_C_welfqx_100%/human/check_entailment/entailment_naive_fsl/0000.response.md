Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has multiple different elements, but the most frequent element is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `1` because you can make all elements equal by selecting `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2`, which costs only `3` burles. However, the program does not correctly identify this optimal solution. It only checks the longest prefix and suffix of the same element, which is not sufficient to find the minimum cost in all cases.
