You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        z = s.count('mapie')
        print(x + y - z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        z = s.count('mapie')
        
        print(x + y - z)
        
    #State: The function will print the result of `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'map' in the string `s`, `y` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'pie' in the string `s`, and `z` is the number of occurrences of the substring 'mapie' in the string `s`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are calculated for each test case independently. The initial state of the function parameters `t` and the list of tuples remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. It only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the count of "mapie" (which is not a valid substring to consider in this context). This approach does not ensure that the string is made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.

For example, consider the input string "mappie":
- The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- It will also count 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- The output will be 1 + 1 - 0 = 2, which is incorrect.

The correct output should be 1, as removing the 'a' from "mappie" makes the string "mpie", which is still ugly. However, removing the 'p' from "mappie" makes the string "maie", which is beautiful. The program fails to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
