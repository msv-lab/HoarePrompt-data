Output State: **The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged. The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Depending on the conditions, it prints either A * B, A * C / 2, or two lines: X and X * C + B, where X is A // 2. The specific output for each iteration depends on the input values of A, B, and C.**
