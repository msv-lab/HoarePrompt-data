Precondition: **The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5` and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the binary string `s` and the number of test cases `t` as parameters. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, s):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and s is a list of binary strings where each string `s[i]` has a length `2 <= len(s[i]) <= 2 * 10^5` and consists of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s` does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**
