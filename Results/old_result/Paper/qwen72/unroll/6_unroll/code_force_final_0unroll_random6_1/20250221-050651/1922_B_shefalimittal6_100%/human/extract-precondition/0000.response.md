Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths (2^{a_i}), and an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 \le a_i \le n. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def count_triangle_ways(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
