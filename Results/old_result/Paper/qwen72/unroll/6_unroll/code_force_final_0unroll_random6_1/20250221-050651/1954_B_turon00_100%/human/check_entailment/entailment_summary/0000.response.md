Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in its approach to solving the problem. The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful. However, the program only checks the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array, which does not correctly address the problem requirements.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals**:
   - The program calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`). This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing other elements that are not necessarily consecutive or equal to the first element.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will calculate the minimum count of consecutive `1`s, which is 3, but the correct answer is 1 (removing the last `1`).

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element by printing `-1`.
   - However, it incorrectly handles the case where all elements are the same. For example, in the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program will print `-1`, which is correct, but it does not correctly handle cases where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

3. **General Approach**:
   - The correct approach should involve identifying the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation (choosing an index `i` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`) can be performed to make the array beautiful again.
   - This typically involves finding the longest subarray where the elements at the ends are the same and the middle element is different, and then determining the minimum number of elements to remove to break this pattern.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
