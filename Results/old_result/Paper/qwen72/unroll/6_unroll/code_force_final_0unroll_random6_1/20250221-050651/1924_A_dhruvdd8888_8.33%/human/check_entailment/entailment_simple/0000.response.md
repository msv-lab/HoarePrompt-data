Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, but it should accept `n`, `k`, and `s` as parameters to match the problem description.
   - The function is called in a loop, but without any arguments. This is incorrect and will result in a `TypeError` since the function expects no arguments but the problem description clearly states that it should handle inputs `n`, `k`, and `s`.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input and then reads the string `s`. This part is correct.
   - The set `us` is correctly initialized to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Subsequence Checking**:
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to track characters in `s` that are in `us`.
   - It adds characters to `win` until `win` contains `k` unique characters, at which point it adds the current character to `ans` and clears `win`.
   - However, this approach does not correctly check for all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. It only checks for a specific pattern where `win` contains all `k` unique characters before adding to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - If `ps` (the number of times `win` reached the size `k`) is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES'. This is incorrect because `ps` does not represent the number of unique subsequences of length `n` that can be formed.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and then tries to construct a string that is not a subsequence of `s`. The logic here is flawed:
     - It checks if a character in `us` is not in `win` and constructs a string by appending this character to `ans` and padding with 'a' characters.
     - This does not guarantee that the constructed string is not a subsequence of `s`, and it may not even be a valid string of length `n`.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The construction of the string that is not a subsequence is also incorrect and may not produce a valid result.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
