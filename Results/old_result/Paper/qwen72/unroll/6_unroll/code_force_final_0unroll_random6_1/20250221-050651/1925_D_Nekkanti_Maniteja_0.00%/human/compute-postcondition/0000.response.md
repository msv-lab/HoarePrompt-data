The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer greater than 0. The state of `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop, as it is initialized by the `range` function.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
