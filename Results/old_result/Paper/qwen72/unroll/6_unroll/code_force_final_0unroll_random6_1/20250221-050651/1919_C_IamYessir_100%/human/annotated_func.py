#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases t is given, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a, b = [], []
        
        cp = 0
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if len(a) == 0:
                x = float('inf')
            else:
                x = a[-1]
            if len(b) == 0:
                y = float('inf')
            else:
                y = b[-1]
            if x > y:
                if y >= lit[i]:
                    b.append(lit[i])
                elif lit[i] > x:
                    b.append(lit[i])
                elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                    a.append(lit[i])
            elif x == y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif x < y:
                if x >= lit[i]:
                    a.append(lit[i])

            if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
                s += 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(b)):
            if b[i] > b[i - 1]:

    #State: The function `func` will print the total number of increasing pairs in the lists `a` and `b` for each test case. The lists `a` and `b` will be updated based on the conditions within the loop, and the variable `s` will be reset to 0 for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function will have printed the results for each test case, and the final state of the function will be ready to handle the next set of test cases if provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It distributes the integers between two lists, `a` and `b`, based on specific conditions. After processing, it calculates the total number of increasing pairs in both lists and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the function will have printed the total number of increasing pairs for each test case, and the lists `a` and `b` will be reset for the next test case.
