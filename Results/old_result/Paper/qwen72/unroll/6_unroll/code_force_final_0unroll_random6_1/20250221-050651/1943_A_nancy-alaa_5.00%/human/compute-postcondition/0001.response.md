Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of t, n, and a remain unchanged. The variable `first` is either True or False depending on whether a unique integer was found in the list `arr`. The variable `arr` is a list of n integers read from input, and `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.**
