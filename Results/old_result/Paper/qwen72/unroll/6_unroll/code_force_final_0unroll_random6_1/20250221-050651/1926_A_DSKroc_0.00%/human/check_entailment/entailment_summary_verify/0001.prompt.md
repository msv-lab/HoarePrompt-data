You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and outputs the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to standard output. If the number of 'A' and 'B' characters is equal in a string, the function outputs 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function has no further effect on the program state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem statement.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, each time reading a string `s` of length 5.
3. **Counting Characters**: Inside the loop, the program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. It then iterates through each character in the string `s` and increments `ac` if the character is 'A' and `bc` if the character is 'B'.
4. **Comparison and Output**: After counting the characters for a single string, the program should compare `ac` and `bc` and print the character that appears more frequently. However, the current program only does this comparison and print after the loop has finished for all test cases, which is incorrect.

The program should print the result for each test case immediately after processing the string, not after processing all test cases. This is a critical flaw in the logic.

Correctness: **False**

To fix this, the comparison and print statements should be moved inside the loop that processes each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This corrected version will ensure that the result for each test case is printed immediately after processing the string, which matches the problem requirements.
