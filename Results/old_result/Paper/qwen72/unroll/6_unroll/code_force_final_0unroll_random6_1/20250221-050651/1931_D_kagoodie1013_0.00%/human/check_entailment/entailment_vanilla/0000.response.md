Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case, including `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Test Case Storage**:
   - The program stores each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in a list `test_cases`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

4. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The program iterates through each element `num` in the array `arr`.
   - It calculates `mod_x` as `-num % x` and `mod_y` as `num % y`.
   - It increments the `count` by the number of elements already seen in the array that have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` remainders.
   - It updates the dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, one per line.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Checking for Beautiful Pairs**:
  - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.
  - The program uses the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y` to check for these conditions.
  - For \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by `x`, the sum of the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j\) when divided by `x` should be zero (or a multiple of `x`). This is checked using `mod_x = -num % x`.
  - For \(a_i - a_j\) to be divisible by `y`, the difference of the remainders of \(a_i\) and \(a_j` when divided by `y` should be zero. This is checked using `mod_y = num % y`.

- **Counting Pairs**:
  - The program counts the number of pairs by checking how many elements already seen have the same remainders.
  - This is done by incrementing `count` with the values from `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Remainder Calculation**:
  - The calculation `mod_x = -num % x` is incorrect. It should be `mod_x = (-num) % x` to ensure the correct remainder.
  - The calculation `mod_y = num % y` is correct.

- **Dictionary Key Updates**:
  - The program updates the dictionaries with `mod_x_key = num % x` and `mod_y_key = num % y`, which is correct.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = (-num) % x  # Corrected here
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```
