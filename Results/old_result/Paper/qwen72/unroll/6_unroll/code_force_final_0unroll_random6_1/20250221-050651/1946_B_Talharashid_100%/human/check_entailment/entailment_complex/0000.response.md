### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum back into the array.
   - The key insight is that the maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray to the array.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func` processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads a list `l` of `n` integers.
   - It initializes `c` to 0, which will be used to track the current sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - It initializes `maxi` to 0, which will store the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray found so far.
   - It iterates through the list `l`:
     - If the current element `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi` and resets `c` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it ensures `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - It then calculates the final result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` and prints it.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray (`maxi`).
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is used to calculate the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The formula works because:
     - `2 ** k * maxi` accounts for the maximum sum being added `k` times.
     - `- maxi` ensures that the initial maximum sum is not counted twice.
     - `sum(l)` is the sum of the original array.
   - The result is taken modulo `1000000007` to handle large numbers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Empty Subarray:** The algorithm correctly handles the case where the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is 0 (an empty subarray).
   - **Negative Elements:** The algorithm correctly handles arrays with negative elements by resetting `c` when a negative element is encountered and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the negative element.
   - **Large Values:** The algorithm uses modulo `1000000007` to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The function reads the input correctly and processes each test case as described.
   - The output is printed for each test case, and the format matches the problem description.
