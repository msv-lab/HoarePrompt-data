### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` using a for loop.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if it is equal to `tmp`.
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- The logic of the program is to find the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are the same and can be removed to break the beautiful property.
- However, the program has a flaw in its logic. It only considers segments of consecutive elements that are the same and does not account for the possibility of breaking the beautiful property by removing elements that are not in such segments.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `3 2 2 2`, the program will output `-1` because all elements are the same, and removing any element will still leave the array beautiful.
- For the input `5 1 2 1 2 1`, the program will output `1` because removing the last element will break the beautiful property.
- For the input `1 1`, the program will output `-1` because the array is already non-beautiful.
- For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program will output `3` because removing the first three elements will break the beautiful property.

### Flaw:
- The program does not correctly handle cases where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. For example, in the array `1 2 1 2 1`, removing the middle `2` (index 2) will make the array non-beautiful, but the program does not consider this.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to break the beautiful property of the array.

### Correctness: **False**
