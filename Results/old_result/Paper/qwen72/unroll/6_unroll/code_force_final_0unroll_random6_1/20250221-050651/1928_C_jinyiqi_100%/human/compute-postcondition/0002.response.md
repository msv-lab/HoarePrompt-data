To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects and variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` contains at least one value. This means that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `int(x ** 0.5)` being at least 1. Since `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `int(x ** 0.5)` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop will execute.

However, the initial state of `i` is not explicitly given, and for the loop to start, `i` should be set to 1, which is the starting point of the range.

The initial state of `output1` and `output2` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
