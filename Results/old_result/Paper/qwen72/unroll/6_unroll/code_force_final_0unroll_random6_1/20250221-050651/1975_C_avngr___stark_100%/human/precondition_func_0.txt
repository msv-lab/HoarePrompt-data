The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of positive integers. However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` to match the problem description. The preconditions for these parameters are: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
