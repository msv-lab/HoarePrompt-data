The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p` as parameters. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def min_invitations(n, p):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= p[i] <= n, p[i] != i, and all elements in p are distinct.**
