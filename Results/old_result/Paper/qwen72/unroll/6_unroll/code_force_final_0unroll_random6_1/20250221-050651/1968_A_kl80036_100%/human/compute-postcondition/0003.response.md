Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and prints the value of `x - 1`. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
