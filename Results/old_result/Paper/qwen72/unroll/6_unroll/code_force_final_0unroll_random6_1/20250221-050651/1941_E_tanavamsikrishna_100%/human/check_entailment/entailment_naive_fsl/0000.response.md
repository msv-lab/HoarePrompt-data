Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it handles the installation of supports for the bridge. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly enforce the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The function only considers the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d`, but it does not ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the distance between supports exceeds `d`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 1
0 1 2 3 0
```
The correct output should be `6` (since supports must be placed in every cell due to `d = 1`), but the program will output a different value because it does not enforce the condition that the distance between supports must be no more than `d`.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should ensure that supports are placed at every `d` distance or less, and the cost should be calculated accordingly.
