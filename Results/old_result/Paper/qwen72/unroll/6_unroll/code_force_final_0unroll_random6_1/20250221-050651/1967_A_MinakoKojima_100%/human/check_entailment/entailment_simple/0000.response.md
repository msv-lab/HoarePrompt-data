### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of integers representing the number of cards of each type.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to handle the smallest counts first, which is important for maximizing the number of permutations.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `a[0]`, which is the smallest count of any card type.
   - `res` is initialized to `n - 1`, representing the number of card types that need to be adjusted to form a permutation.

4. **Adjusting Card Counts:**
   - The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` to adjust the counts of the card types.
   - For each card type, it calculates the difference `dif` between the current count and the next count.
   - If `dif` is zero, it means the current and next counts are the same, so `res` is decremented.
   - If `dif` is not zero, it checks if `k` is sufficient to make the counts equal. If so, it adjusts `ans` and `k` accordingly and decrements `res`.
   - If `k` is not sufficient, it adjusts `ans` by the maximum possible amount and updates `res` with the remainder of `k`.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If `k` is still not zero after the loop, it adds the remaining coins to `ans` in a way that maximizes the number of permutations.
   - The final score is calculated by adding the number of permutations formed by the adjusted counts and the remaining `res`.

6. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are stored in `ans_list` and printed at the end.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The sorting step ensures that the smallest counts are adjusted first, which is necessary for maximizing the number of permutations.
- The logic for adjusting card counts and calculating the final score is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements.
- The program correctly handles edge cases where `k` is zero or where `k` is not sufficient to make all counts equal.

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.
