Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the condition used to determine the winner. The condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:` is incorrect because the bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the equality operator `==`. This means the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`, which is not the intended logic.

The correct condition should be `if (a + b) % 2 == 0:` to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This corrected version will properly determine the winner based on the problem description.
