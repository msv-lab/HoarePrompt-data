Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` using a `defaultdict`. It then iterates through the possible integers from 0 to `N-1` and prints the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once. However, this approach does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

To understand why, let's break down the optimal strategy for both players:
1. **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
2. **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

### Optimal Strategy:
- **Alice**: Alice should always pick the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `a` because this ensures that the integer will be included in `c` and will contribute to the MEX.
- **Bob**: Bob should always pick the smallest integer that appears an even number of times in `a` because this ensures that the integer will not be included in `c` and will not contribute to the MEX.

### Analysis of the Provided Program:
- The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and checks if the count of `i` is 1 or 0.
- If the count of `i` is 1, it increments a counter `t`.
- If `t` reaches 2 or the count of `i` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

This approach is incorrect because:
- It does not consider the optimal strategy where Alice and Bob take turns.
- It does not handle the case where integers appear more than once but in even or odd counts.

### Correct Approach:
- Count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
- Iterate through the integers from 0 to `N-1` and determine the optimal moves for Alice and Bob.
- The final MEX will be the smallest integer that either does not appear in `a` or appears an even number of times (since Bob can always ensure that such integers do not contribute to the MEX).

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        mex = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 0 or cnt[i] % 2 == 0:
                mex = i
                break
        print(mex)

```

### Explanation:
- **cnt[i] == 0**: If the integer `i` does not appear in `a`, it is the MEX.
- **cnt[i] % 2 == 0**: If the integer `i` appears an even number of times, Bob can always ensure that `i` does not appear in `c` by picking it whenever Alice picks it.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
