Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices so that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins. The program works as follows:

1. **Initial Check (`n == k`)**: 
   - If `n` equals `k`, it means Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with each jewel priced at 1 coin. This is a straightforward case and the solution is correct.
   - The program prints 'YES', followed by 1 (indicating one stall), and then 1 (indicating the price per jewel for that stall).

2. **Second Check (`n + 2 > k * 2`)**:
   - This condition checks if Alice can buy `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. The first stall is priced such that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels, and the second stall is priced at 1 coin per jewel, allowing Alice to buy the last jewel.
   - The condition `n + 2 > k * 2` ensures that Alice has enough coins to buy `k - 1` jewels at the first stall and at least 1 coin left for the last jewel at the second stall.
   - If this condition is met, the program prints 'YES', followed by 2 (indicating two stalls), and then the prices for these stalls: `n - k + 1` for the first stall and 1 for the second stall.

3. **Final Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.
   - The program prints 'NO'.

Let's analyze the conditions:

- **Case 1 (`n == k`)**:
  - This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall with each jewel priced at 1 coin.
  - Example: `n = 7`, `k = 7` → Alice buys 7 jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin each.

- **Case 2 (`n + 2 > k * 2`)**:
  - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2 * k - 2`.
  - This ensures that Alice can buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall.
  - Example: `n = 7`, `k = 3` → Alice buys 2 jewels from the first stall priced at 5 coins each (10 - 7 = 3 coins left), and 1 jewel from the second stall priced at 1 coin (3 - 1 = 2 coins left).

- **Case 3 (`n + 2 <= k * 2`)**:
  - This condition ensures that it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins.
  - Example: `n = 6`, `k = 4` → Alice cannot buy 4 jewels with 6 coins because even if she buys 3 jewels at 1 coin each, she will have 3 coins left, which is not enough to buy the 4th jewel.

The program correctly handles all the cases and provides the appropriate output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
