Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the elements in the left and right halves of the array are not sorted in a way that allows the program to correctly identify pairs of elements that can be used to form the subsets `l` and `r` with the required properties. Specifically, the program assumes that the elements in `lft` and `rgt` are sorted and that pairs of identical elements are adjacent, which may not always be the case after sorting. This can lead to incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
1 3 2 4 1 3 2 4
```
The program will output:
```
2 2 3 1
2 2 3 1
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```
The program fails to correctly identify and print the required subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the conditions for this input.
