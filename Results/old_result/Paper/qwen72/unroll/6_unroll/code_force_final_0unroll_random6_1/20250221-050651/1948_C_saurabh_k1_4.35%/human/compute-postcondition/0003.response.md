Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`, consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function then checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not retain any values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` after each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. **
