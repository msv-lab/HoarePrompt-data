Output State: **The function will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have generated and printed a permutation of length n, where the permutation alternates between the largest and smallest remaining numbers, starting with the largest. The variables `i` and `ind` will have their final values after the last iteration of the loop, but these values are not significant as they are local to the loop. The total number of test cases `t` will remain unchanged, and the sum of all `n` values across test cases will also remain unchanged.**
