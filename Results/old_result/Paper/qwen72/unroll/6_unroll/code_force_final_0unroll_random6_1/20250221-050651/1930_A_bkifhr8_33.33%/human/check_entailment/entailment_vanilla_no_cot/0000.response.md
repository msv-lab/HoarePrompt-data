Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**:
   - The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements from the list. However, `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which means the program is not correctly removing the elements it is supposed to. Instead, it should remove the first two elements of the list in each iteration.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not appropriate. The loop should continue until all elements are processed, which means the condition should be `while len(lst) > 0:`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The program does not sort the list before processing it. To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest elements together. Sorting the list ensures that you always pick the smallest available elements.

4. **Inefficient Element Removal**:
   - Removing elements from a list using `remove` is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results. Instead, you should use slicing to remove the first two elements after each operation.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n):
            ans += lst[2 * i]
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   
2. **Sorting the List**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `lst`. It then sorts the list to ensure that the smallest elements are paired together.

3. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and adds the smallest element of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the smallest element of each pair is always the first element of the pair.

4. **Outputting the Results**:
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.
