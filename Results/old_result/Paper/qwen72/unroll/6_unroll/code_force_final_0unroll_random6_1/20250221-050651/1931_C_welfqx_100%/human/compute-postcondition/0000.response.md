Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the size of the array, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, representing the array elements. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
