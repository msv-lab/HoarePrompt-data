Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem of making a string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. It only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and subtracts the count of "mapie" (which is not a valid substring to consider in this context). This approach does not ensure that the string is made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters.

For example, consider the input string "mappie":
- The program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- It will also count 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- The output will be 1 + 1 - 0 = 2, which is incorrect.

The correct output should be 1, as removing the 'a' from "mappie" makes the string "mpie", which is still ugly. However, removing the 'p' from "mappie" makes the string "maie", which is beautiful. The program fails to find the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
