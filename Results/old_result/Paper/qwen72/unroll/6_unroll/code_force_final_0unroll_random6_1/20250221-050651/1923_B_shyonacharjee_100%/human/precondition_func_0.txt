t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: (n, k, a, x). n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the maximum number of bullets you can fire per second. a is a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9, representing the health of each monster. x is a list of n integers, each between -n and n, representing the initial positions of the monsters, with the constraint that x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
