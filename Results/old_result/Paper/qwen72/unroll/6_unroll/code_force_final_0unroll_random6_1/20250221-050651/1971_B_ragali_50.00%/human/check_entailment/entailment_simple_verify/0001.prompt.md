You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string s in the test cases is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.

    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')

            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` is unchanged as it controls the number of iterations. Each string `s` from the input has been processed, and for each `s` where the set `a` (containing unique characters of `s`) has more than one unique character, the output is 'YES' followed by a modified version of `s`. If `s` has only one unique character, the output is 'NO'. The set `a` is reset for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - This is done to check if the string contains more than one unique character.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If the set `a` has more than one unique character (`len(a) > 1`), it means the string can be rearranged to form a different string.
   - If the set `a` has only one unique character (`len(a) == 1`), it means the string cannot be rearranged to form a different string, so the program outputs "NO".

4. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - If the string can be rearranged, the program attempts to create a new string `newstr` by splitting the string `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
   - It then checks if `newstr` is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `newstr`.
   - If `newstr` is not different from `s`, it checks if the reverse of `s` (`isreverse`) is different from `s`. If it is, it prints `isreverse`.
   - If both `newstr` and `isreverse` are the same as `s`, it prints a modified version of `newstr` by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string has only one unique character correctly by outputting "NO".
   - For strings with more than one unique character, the program attempts to generate a different string by rearranging the characters. However, the logic for generating `newstr` and `isreverse` might not always produce a different string, especially for strings of length 2.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the string has a length of 2 and both characters are different. For example, if `s = "ab"`, the program will output "NO" because `newstr` and `isreverse` will both be "ab".
   - The program does not need to check `isreverse` if `newstr` is already different from `s`. This is an unnecessary step.
   - The program does not handle the case where the string has a length of 1. For example, if `s = "d"`, the program will output "NO" because the set `a` will have only one unique character.

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct for all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle strings of length 2 where both characters are different and strings of length 1.

### Correctness: **False**
