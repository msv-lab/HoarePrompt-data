Output State: **The list `left` will still contain the cumulative sum of the elements in the list `a` up to each index `i` for each `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`. The list `ans` will be updated such that for each index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` will be set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` and `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` will remain -1.**
