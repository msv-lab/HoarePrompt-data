### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input, where the first line is the length of the array `n`, and the second line is the array itself.
   - The array `lst` is then processed to find the optimal operations to maximize the sum.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to find the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array after applying the MEX operation.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and computes the potential sum if the MEX operation is applied to each subarray.
   - The indices `r` and `l` that give the maximum sum are returned.
   - The function correctly handles the state where `lst` is a list of integers within the specified constraints.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is intended to recursively add operations to the `ops` list.
   - However, it is not used in the main logic of the program, and its purpose is unclear. It seems to be a helper function that might be intended to handle some recursive operations, but it is not called in the main loop.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function applies the MEX operation to the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and updates the `ops` list with the operations performed.
   - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends the operation again.
   - The function then sets all elements in the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the length of the subarray `n = l - r + 1`.
   - The function correctly updates the `lst` and `ops` lists.

5. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal subarray to apply the MEX operation.
   - It then calls `func_3` to apply the operation and update the `ops` list.
   - The loop continues until `r` equals `l`, which means no further operations can increase the sum.

6. **Final Operations:**
   - After the main loop, the program attempts to replace all zeros in the array with ones.
   - This is done using a `try`-`except` block to catch the `ValueError` when `lst.index(0)` fails because there are no more zeros in the array.
   - This step ensures that all zeros are replaced with ones, which is a valid operation to maximize the sum.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum of the array and the number of operations performed.
   - It then prints each operation in the `ops` list.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly identifies the subarray that maximizes the sum after applying the MEX operation.
- The MEX operation is applied correctly, and the `ops` list is updated accordingly.
- The final step of replacing zeros with ones is also correct and ensures that the sum is maximized.
- The program adheres to the constraints of the problem, including the maximum number of operations.

However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Function `func_2` is not used:**
  - The function `func_2` is defined but not used in the main logic. This suggests that it might be a leftover from a previous version of the code or a part of a different approach.
  - The presence of this function does not affect the correctness of the program, but it is unnecessary and can be removed for clarity.

- **Potential Redundancy in `func_3`:**
  - The function `func_3` appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which might be redundant. The MEX operation should only be applied once to a subarray, and the subsequent appends might be unnecessary.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the array is already optimal (e.g., the second example) by not performing any operations.
  - The program also handles the case where the array contains zeros and replaces them with ones, which is a valid operation.

### Conclusion:

Despite the presence of an unused function and potential redundancy in `func_3`, the program correctly maximizes the sum of the array and outputs the operations. Therefore, the program is correct in terms of achieving the desired outcome.

Correctness: **True**
