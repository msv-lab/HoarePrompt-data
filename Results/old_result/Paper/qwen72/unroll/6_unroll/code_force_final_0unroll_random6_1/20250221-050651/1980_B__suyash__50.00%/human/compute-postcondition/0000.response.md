Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must be between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
