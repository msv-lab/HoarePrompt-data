### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid, ensuring that each bridge has supports at the first and last columns and that the distance between any two adjacent supports does not exceed `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a single bridge on a given row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d` cells by adding 2 to each cell (1 for the support and 1 for the cost).
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost for the next `d` cells.
   - For each cell beyond the first `d` cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the distance `d` and adds the current cell's cost to it.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the total cost for the row.

   **Analysis**:
   - The initialization of the first `d` cells by adding 2 to each cell is incorrect. The cost should be `a_{i, j} + 1` for each cell, not `a_{i, j} + 2`.
   - The use of a min-heap to find the minimum cost within the distance `d` is appropriate and efficient.
   - The function correctly ensures that the first and last columns have supports.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of river depths.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
   - It prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

   **Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It correctly calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive bridges and finds the minimum total cost.
   - The function handles the edge cases where the grid is small and the number of bridges is large.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is printed for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns always have supports, as required by the problem.
   - It handles the case where the grid is small and the number of bridges is large.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is mostly correct but has a critical error in the initialization of the first `d` cells in `func_1`. The cost should be `a_{i, j} + 1` instead of `a_{i, j} + 2`. This error will lead to incorrect cost calculations for each row, and consequently, the total cost for `k` consecutive bridges will also be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

### Final:
