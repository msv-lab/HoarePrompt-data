Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: the number of test cases t, a list of integers n for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 x n grid for each test case. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is a list of integers such that for each n_i, 2 <= n_i <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of all n_i does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Each binary string is of length n_i and consists of characters '0' or '1'.**

Note: The function definition provided in the example is incorrect as it does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the list of n values, and the list of binary strings. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list, grid_list):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, `n_list` is a list of integers representing the width of the grid for each test case, and `grid_list` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two binary strings representing the rows of the grid.
