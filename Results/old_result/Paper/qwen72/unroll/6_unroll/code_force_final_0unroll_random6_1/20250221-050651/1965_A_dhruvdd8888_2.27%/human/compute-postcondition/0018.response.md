Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the user input, then reads a space-separated list of integers, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, and sorts the resulting unique integers. It then determines the winner between 'Alice' and 'Bob' based on the following criteria: if the length of the sorted unique integers is 1, it prints 'Alice'; if the length is 2, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it counts the number of consecutive pairs of integers starting from the first element (excluding 0) that have a difference of 1. If this count is odd, it prints 'Bob'; if even, it prints 'Alice'. In all cases, the function returns `None`. **
