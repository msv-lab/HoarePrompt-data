The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at the even indices of the list `a`.

- `a[::2]` selects elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
- `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
- The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

After executing the code:
- The elements at even indices of `a` are reversed.
- The elements at odd indices of `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) with elements at even indices reversed.**
