You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), forming a beautiful array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n

            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop completes its execution, and for each test case, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array, or -1 if the array has only one element or all elements are the same. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are no longer in use after the loop finishes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array. If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables used within the function are no longer in use.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - The variable `cnt` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which will store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` using a for loop.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if it is equal to `tmp`.
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, it increments `cnt`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
- The logic of the program is to find the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are the same and can be removed to break the beautiful property.
- However, the program has a flaw in its logic. It only considers segments of consecutive elements that are the same and does not account for the possibility of breaking the beautiful property by removing elements that are not in such segments.

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input `3 2 2 2`, the program will output `-1` because all elements are the same, and removing any element will still leave the array beautiful.
- For the input `5 1 2 1 2 1`, the program will output `1` because removing the last element will break the beautiful property.
- For the input `1 1`, the program will output `-1` because the array is already non-beautiful.
- For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program will output `3` because removing the first three elements will break the beautiful property.

### Flaw:
- The program does not correctly handle cases where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. For example, in the array `1 2 1 2 1`, removing the middle `2` (index 2) will make the array non-beautiful, but the program does not consider this.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to break the beautiful property of the array.

### Correctness: **False**
