### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\).

3. **Array Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the array \(a\) in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The sorted array ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are minimized for each pair of consecutive elements, but the sum of these differences is maximized.

4. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - This is done using a loop that iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) and adds the difference \(b[x] - b[x-1]\) to the `beauty` variable.

5. **Special Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, the beauty is 0, and the program prints 0.
   - However, this check is not necessary because the beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate the beauty without this check.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Function**:
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary. The beauty of a sorted array is always the same, and the program can directly calculate it without checking if the array is already sorted.
  - This function can be removed to simplify the code.

- **Edge Case**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all elements being 69).

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but can be simplified by removing the unnecessary `func_1` function. The logic for sorting and calculating the beauty is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True** (but can be improved by removing the unnecessary function).
