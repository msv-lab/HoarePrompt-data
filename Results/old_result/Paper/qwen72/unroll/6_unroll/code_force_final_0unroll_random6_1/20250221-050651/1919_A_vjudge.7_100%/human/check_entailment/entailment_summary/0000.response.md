Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins each has. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins both players have combined. The game rules and the optimal play strategy imply that the player who starts with the wallet that will eventually have an odd number of total coins (considering both wallets together) will always have the last move and thus win the game. This is because the game continues until one player cannot make a move, which happens when both wallets are empty. If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) will always have the last move, and if the total number of coins is even, the second player (Bob) will have the last move.

The program provided checks the sum of `a` and `b` (the number of coins Alice and Bob have, respectively) and determines the winner based on whether this sum is even or odd. The logic used in the program is:
- If `(a + b) & 1 == 0`, the sum is even, and Bob wins.
- If `(a + b) & 1 != 0`, the sum is odd, and Alice wins.

This logic is correct because:
- The bitwise AND operation `& 1` checks if the least significant bit of the sum is 1 (indicating an odd number) or 0 (indicating an even number).
- If the sum is even, Bob will always have the last move, and if the sum is odd, Alice will always have the last move.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, and the logic for determining the winner is accurate based on the game's rules and optimal play.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
