Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is equal to the total number of elements in `data`.
   - `t` is equal to `int(data[0])`.
   - `results` is a list of strings where each string represents the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length for each test case.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `results` list contains strings, each representing the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length for a test case.
   - The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate all the strings in the `results` list, separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - Therefore, the output will be a string where each element of the `results` list is printed on a new line.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of the `results` list are not provided, we can only describe the structure of the output.
   - Each element of the `results` list will be printed on a new line.

Output: **[result1]
[result2]
...
[resultN] (where each [resultX] is a string representing the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length for each test case)**
