Output State: **For each test case, the variable `c` will contain the number of elements in the array `l` that are greater than the two smallest distinct elements found in `l`. The values of `a` and `b` will be the two smallest distinct elements in `l`, if they exist. If there are fewer than two distinct elements, `a` will be the smallest element and `b` will remain `inf`. The loop will print the value of `c` for each test case.**
