Reasoning:  
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it processes the list of integers for each test case. Specifically, the program attempts to remove elements from the list using indices that are not correctly calculated. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect because they do not correctly remove the elements that have been used to calculate the minimum value. Instead, they remove elements at positions that are not necessarily the ones that were just used.

Additionally, the program does not sort the list of integers, which is crucial for ensuring that the minimum value is always selected optimally. To achieve the maximum score, you should always pair the smallest available numbers together. Sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (which will be the minimum values of each pair) is the correct approach.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

Explanation:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers, converts the list to integers, and sorts it.
3. **Calculating the Score**: It calculates the maximum score by summing the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the minimum values of each pair.
4. **Appending and Printing the Result**: It appends the calculated score to the list `ans_f` and prints each score after processing all test cases.

Given the logical error in the original program, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
