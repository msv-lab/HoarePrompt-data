Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `n` is 0 and `m` is odd, it prints 1. If `n` is 0 and `m` is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the difference between `k` and the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the values of `x` and `y` (which are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9) and does not return any value. **
