Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(row, d: int):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2

        heappush(min_heap, e)
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
    return row[-1]
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of integers where the first and last elements are 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It modifies the list `row` by setting `row[0]` to 1 and incrementing each element in the range 1 to d-1 by 2. For each element in the range `d` to `len(row) - 1`, it updates the element based on the minimum value from a sliding window of size `d` in the list, adding 1 to the sum of the element and the minimum value. The function returns the value of `row[-1]`, which is the last element of the modified list.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    (n, m, k, d) = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
    print(min(total_costs))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads input values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` (integers) and a list `rows` (a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers with the first and last integers being 0). It computes the minimum sum of `k` consecutive elements from a list of costs, where each cost is the result of applying `func_1` to each row in `rows` with the parameter `d`. The function prints this minimum sum and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs` are defined, with `total_costs` containing the sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
