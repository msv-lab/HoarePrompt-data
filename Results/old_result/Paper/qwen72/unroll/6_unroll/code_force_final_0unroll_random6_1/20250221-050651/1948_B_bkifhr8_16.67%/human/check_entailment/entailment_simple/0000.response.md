### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10.
   - It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the list in the correct positions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After the operation simulation, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function compares the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating the list is sorted.

4. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The main issue with the program is that it only performs the operation once for each pair of elements where the first element is greater than the second and is greater than 10.
   - This single pass is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted after all possible operations. The operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
     - After the first pass, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.
     - The program correctly outputs `YES`.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `[12, 28, 5]`
     - After the first pass, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`, which is not sorted.
     - The program incorrectly outputs `NO` because it does not consider further operations (e.g., splitting 28 into 2 and 8).
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `[0, 0]`
     - The array is already sorted.
     - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not perform the operation multiple times as needed to ensure the array can be sorted. It only performs the operation once for each pair of elements, which is insufficient for some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
