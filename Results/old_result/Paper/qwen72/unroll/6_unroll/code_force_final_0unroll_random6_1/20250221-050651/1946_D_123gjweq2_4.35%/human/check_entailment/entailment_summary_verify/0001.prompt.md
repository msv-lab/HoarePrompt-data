You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` accepts a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr` and an integer `bit` (0 <= bit < 30). It returns the number of elements in `cur_arr` if `bit` is -1. Otherwise, it returns -1 if the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR of all elements in `cur_arr` is 1. If the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of a new list `new_arr`, which contains the cumulative XOR values up to the point where the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of `31` as the initial bit is correct because the maximum value of `x` is less than `2^30`, so the highest bit to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed). Starting from the 31st bit (1-indexed) ensures that all bits are considered.

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit == -1`, it means we have considered all bits, and the length of `cur_arr` is the number of valid segments.
   - **Initialization**: `new_arr` is used to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit.
   - **Loop**: For each element in `cur_arr`, we compute the running XOR and check if the current bit is set.
     - If the current bit is not set, we append the current XOR to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
   - **Final Check**: After the loop, if `xor` still has the current bit set, it means we cannot form a valid segment, so `thing1` is set to `-1`.
   - **Recursive Call**:
     - If the current bit of `x` is set, we need to consider both the case where the current bit is set and where it is not set.
     - We return the maximum of the two recursive calls: one with the current bit set and one with the current bit not set.
     - If the current bit of `x` is not set, we only consider the case where the current bit is not set in the segments.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - It ensures that the segments are formed such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - The use of `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments that do not set the current bit is a valid approach.
   - The recursive calls and the conditions for setting `thing1` are correctly implemented to ensure the maximum number of valid segments is found.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It uses a recursive approach to consider all possible segments and ensures that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`. The logic and conditions are implemented correctly to find the maximum number of valid segments.
