### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program provided always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it. Let's analyze why this approach is correct:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest positive integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.
   - When \( y = x - 1 \), \( \gcd(x, x-1) \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers, and the only common divisor of two consecutive integers is 1.

2. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For \( y = x - 1 \), \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) = x \).
   - The value \( x \) is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) and \( \gcd(x, y) \) is 1.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading \( x \) and printing \( x - 1 \).
   - The output \( y = x - 1 \) is always a valid integer within the range \( 1 \le y < x \).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it always finds a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
