The function `func_1` reads input for multiple test cases and determines whether it is possible to survive an encounter with a set of monsters based on the given constraints. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n`, the maximum number of bullets that can be fired per second `k`, the health of each monster `a`, and the initial positions of the monsters `x`. It then checks if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters can be fired within the time it takes for the monsters to reach the player, based on their positions and the firing rate. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to survive, and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables used within the function do not retain any specific values.
