Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided has a logical error in the way it updates the sliding window and checks the number of matching elements. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum of matching elements (`sm`) is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cb` is a `Counter` of the sorted elements of `b`.
   - `ca` is a `Counter` of the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - `sm` is the sum of the values of the intersection of `ca` and `cb`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the initial segment of `a` (first `m` elements) is good by comparing `sm` to `k`.

3. **Sliding Window Update:**
   - The program then iterates over the rest of the elements in `a` to update the sliding window.
   - The logic for updating `sm` is incorrect:
     - `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]: sm += 1` and `if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]: sm -= 1` are not the correct conditions to update the sum of matching elements.
     - The correct approach should be to check if the new element being added to the window (`a[r]`) and the element being removed from the window (`a[r - m]`) affect the number of matching elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add the new element to the window
        new_element = a[r]
        if cb[new_element] > 0:
            sm += ca[new_element] < cb[new_element]
        ca[new_element] += 1
        
        # Remove the old element from the window
        old_element = a[r - m]
        if cb[old_element] > 0:
            sm -= ca[old_element] - 1 <= cb[old_element]
        ca[old_element] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

**Key Changes:**
- The conditions for updating `sm` have been corrected to properly account for the addition and removal of elements in the sliding window.
- The program now correctly checks if the new element being added to the window and the old element being removed from the window affect the number of matching elements.

This corrected version should now produce the correct output for the given problem.
