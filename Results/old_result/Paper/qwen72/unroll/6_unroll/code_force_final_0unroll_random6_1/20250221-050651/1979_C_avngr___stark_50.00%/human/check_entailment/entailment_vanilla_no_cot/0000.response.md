Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Product Calculation**: The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all `k_i` values. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which is not required for the problem.

2. **HCF Calculation**: The HCF (Highest Common Factor) of the `c` values is calculated, but this is not the correct approach to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Sum Comparison**: The program checks if the sum of the `c` values is less than `m / hcf`. This is incorrect because the sum of the bets should be strictly less than the return for each winning outcome, which is `c[i] * k[i]`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k_i` values and then distribute the bets accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_bets(k):
    l = reduce(lcm, k)
    x = [l // ki for ki in k]
    if sum(x) < l:
        return x
    else:
        return -1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = find_bets(k)
    if result == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of all `k_i` values is calculated using the `reduce` function and a helper function `lcm`.

2. **Bet Calculation**: Each bet `x_i` is set to `l // k_i`, where `l` is the LCM of the `k_i` values. This ensures that the return for each winning outcome is a multiple of `l`.

3. **Sum Comparison**: The program checks if the sum of the bets is less than `l`. If it is, the bets are valid and are printed. Otherwise, `-1` is printed.

This approach ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, which is the requirement of the problem.
