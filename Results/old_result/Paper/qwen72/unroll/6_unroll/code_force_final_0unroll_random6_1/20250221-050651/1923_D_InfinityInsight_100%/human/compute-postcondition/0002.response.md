Output State: **a is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a). left is a list containing a single element 0. last is a list containing a single element -1. ans is a list of length n with all elements set to -1.**

The initial state of the variables `a`, `n`, `left`, and `last` remains unchanged. The variable `ans` is now a list of length `n`, where each element in the list is set to -1.
