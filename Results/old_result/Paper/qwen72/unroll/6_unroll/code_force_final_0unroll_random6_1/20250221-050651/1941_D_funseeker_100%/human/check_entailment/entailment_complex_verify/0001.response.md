### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the standard input, which is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python for competitive programming.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers.
   - The annotated code confirms that these functions are used correctly and do not affect the state of the program inappropriately.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`):**
   - The function `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x` to keep track of the possible positions of the ball.
   - The annotated code confirms that `ans` is correctly initialized with the initial player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the new possible positions of the ball.
   - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
   - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to be the set of all possible positions stored in `temp`.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly processes each throw and updates the set of possible positions.

4. **Handling Edge Case for Player 0:**
   - The program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` would be an invalid player number.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly handles this edge case.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.
   - The annotated code confirms that the program correctly prints the number of unique elements in `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The logic correctly handles the transitions for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.
  - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
  - The handling of the edge case where `0` is converted to `n` is correct.
  - The annotated code supports the correctness of these logical steps.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - It also correctly handles the case where the direction is known (`0` or `1`).
  - The annotated code confirms that these edge cases are handled appropriately.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The use of sets and the `%` operator ensures that the program efficiently handles the transitions and avoids duplicate positions.
  - The `lru_cache` is not used in this program, but it is not necessary for the given problem constraints.
  - The annotated code confirms that the program's efficiency is appropriate for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The annotated code provides additional validation that the program's behavior matches the intended logic.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
