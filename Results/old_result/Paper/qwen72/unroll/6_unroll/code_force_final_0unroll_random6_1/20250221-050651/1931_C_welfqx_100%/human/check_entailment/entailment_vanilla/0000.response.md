### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `num`.

2. **Initial Check for Uniform Array:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are already equal by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one.
   - If the array is already uniform (all elements are the same) or if the array has only one element, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because no operation is needed to make all elements equal.

3. **Finding the Longest Prefix and Suffix:**
   - The program creates a reversed copy of the array `onum` to facilitate checking the longest suffix of uniform elements.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the longest prefix of uniform elements (`cn`).
   - Similarly, it iterates through the reversed array to find the longest suffix of uniform elements (`ck`).

4. **Combining Prefix and Suffix:**
   - If the first element of the array (`symb1`) is equal to the last element of the array (`symb2`), it adds the lengths of the prefix and suffix together (`cn += ck`).
   - This step is necessary because if the first and last elements are the same, the longest uniform segment can potentially span both the prefix and the suffix.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - The program calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal by subtracting the maximum of `cn` and `ck` from `n`.
   - This is based on the idea that the minimum cost is achieved by making the longest uniform segment as large as possible, thus minimizing the number of elements that need to be changed.

### Correctness:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It handles the edge cases (uniform array and single-element array) and efficiently finds the longest prefix and suffix of uniform elements to minimize the cost.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic for combining the prefix and suffix. The program adds the lengths of the prefix and suffix if the first and last elements are the same, but this might not always be the correct approach. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1]`, the longest prefix is `[1]` and the longest suffix is `[1, 1, 1]`. Adding these together would give `4`, but the correct answer should be `3` because the middle segment `[2, 3, 1]` can be changed to `1` in one operation.

To fix this, the program should consider the overlap between the prefix and suffix and ensure that the combined length does not exceed the total length of the array.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the overlap between the prefix and suffix correctly, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.
