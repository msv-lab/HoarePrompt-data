The only object in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive), where 2 <= n <= 10^5. This means `remaining_vertices` is not empty, as it contains at least 2 elements (and can contain up to 10^5 elements).

Since `remaining_vertices` is already non-empty, the loop can proceed without any adjustments.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and represents the number of vertices in the graph; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
