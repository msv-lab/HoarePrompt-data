Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
101011

Expected Output:
5

Actual Output:
6
```

The expected output is 5, as the optimal strategy involves the following operations:
1. Choose substring [2, 3]: 101011 → 110011 (cost = 2)
2. Choose substring [3, 4]: 110011 → 111001 (cost = 2)
3. Choose substring [4, 6]: 111001 → 111010 → 111100 (cost = 3)

The total cost is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

However, the program outputs 6, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
