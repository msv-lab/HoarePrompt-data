You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`, consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function then checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not retain any values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` after each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a 2xN grid with arrows in each cell pointing either left (`<`) or right (`>`).
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, N).
   - The robot moves every second: first, it makes a move (left, right, up, or down), and then it follows the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The robot can only move to the right or down because it starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, N).
   - The robot must eventually move to the second row to reach (2, N).
   - The robot can only move to the second row if there is a cell in the first row that points down (`>`).

3. **Critical Condition:**
   - The robot must be able to move to the second row and then move to the rightmost cell (2, N).
   - The key condition is whether the robot can move to the second row and then move to the rightmost cell (2, N) without getting stuck.

4. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.
   - The program checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[n - 2]`) points to the left (`<`).
   - If `b[n - 2]` points to the left, the program prints "No".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Yes".

5. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The program's logic is based on the idea that if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left, the robot cannot move to the rightmost cell (2, N) because it will be stuck in the second-to-last cell.
   - However, this logic is incomplete. The robot can still reach (2, N) if it can move to the second row and then navigate to the rightmost cell using other arrows.

6. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     4
     >><<
     >>><
     ```
     - The robot starts at (1, 1) and can move to (1, 2) (following the arrow `>`, it moves to (1, 3)).
     - From (1, 3), it can move down to (2, 3) (following the arrow `>`, it moves to (2, 4)).
     - The robot reaches (2, 4), which is the rightmost cell.
   - The program would incorrectly print "No" because `b[n - 2]` (which is `b[2]`) points to the left (`<`).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible paths the robot can take to reach the rightmost cell in the second row. It only checks a single condition, which is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution.
