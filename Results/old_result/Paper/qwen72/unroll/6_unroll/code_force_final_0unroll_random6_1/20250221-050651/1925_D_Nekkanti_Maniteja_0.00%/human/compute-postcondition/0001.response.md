Output State: **The function will execute the loop for the specified number of test cases, and for each test case, it will calculate the value of `s` based on the inputs and print `s % M`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `s` will be updated for each test case, but the overall state of the function will reset for each new test case.**

To break it down further:
- `n`, `m`, and `k` will be set by the input for each test case.
- `M` will always be `10**9 + 7`.
- `c` will be calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- `a` will be the sum of the friendship values `f` for all friend pairs.
- `s` will be the final calculated value after the inner loop, and it will be printed as `s % M`.

The loop will reset these variables for each new test case, so the output state for each test case will be the printed value of `s % M`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `s` will be re-initialized for each test case.
