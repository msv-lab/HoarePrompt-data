To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following objects:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from 2 to `n`.
- `n`: This is the upper bound of the range for the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `dp` is a list with values [1, 1].

For the loop to execute, the range `range(2, n + 1)` must contain at least one value. This means that `n` must be at least 2, because if `n` is 1, the range `range(2, 1 + 1)` would be `range(2, 2)`, which is an empty range and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least 2. The variable `i` will start at 2, and `dp` will remain as it is.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list with values [1, 1]**
