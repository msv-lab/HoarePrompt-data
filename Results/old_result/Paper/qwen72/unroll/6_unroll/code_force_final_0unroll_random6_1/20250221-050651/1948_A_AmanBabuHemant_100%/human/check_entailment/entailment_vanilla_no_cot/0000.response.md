Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters always come in pairs (e.g., "AA" or "BB").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This ensures that there are exactly `n` special characters in the string. Each "AAB" pattern contributes 2 special characters (the first 'A' and the second 'A').

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO'. This is a valid check because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is a solution of length at most 200.

The program meets all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description, and it correctly handles all edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
