Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` which has been updated based on the conditions specified. For each index `i` in the range `[1, n-1]`, if `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)` with `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, but only if `inx` is non-negative and greater than or equal to `last[i - 1]`. If `inx` is negative or less than `last[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` remains -1.**
