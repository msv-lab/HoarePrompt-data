### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the second type of operation in the `func_1` function. Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The first type of operation (b=1) appends an integer `x` to the array.
   - The second type of operation (b=2) appends `x` copies of the current array to the end of the array.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty result list `result`.
     - It iterates through the operations:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it appends one copy of the current array to itself, regardless of the value `x`. This is the critical issue.
     - After processing all operations, it iterates through the queries and appends the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
     - Finally, it returns the result list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, then reads the operations and queries.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Issue with `func_1`**:
   - The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is incorrect because it only appends one copy of the current array. The correct implementation should append `x` copies of the current array.
   - The correct implementation for the second type of operation should be:
     ```python
     if op_type == 2:
         current_array = array.copy()
         for _ in range(x - 1):
             array.extend(current_array)
     ```

4. **Example of Incorrect Behavior**:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     1
     5 10
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     1 3
     2 2
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1
     ```
   - **Actual Output**:
     ```
     1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3
     ```
   - **Explanation**:
     - After the first operation, `array = [1]`.
     - After the second operation, `array = [1, 2]`.
     - After the third operation (b=2, x=3), the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` but the program only appends one copy, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - After the fourth operation, `array = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - After the fifth operation (b=2, x=2), the array should become `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` but the program only appends one copy, resulting in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - The queries are then processed based on the incorrect array, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the second type of operation (b=2) correctly, as it only appends one copy of the array instead of `x` copies. This leads to incorrect results for the queries.
