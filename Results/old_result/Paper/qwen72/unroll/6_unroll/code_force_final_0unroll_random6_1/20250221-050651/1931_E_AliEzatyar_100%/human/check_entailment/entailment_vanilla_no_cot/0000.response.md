Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Misinterpretation of the Game Rules**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the game is about counting the total number of digits and subtracting the number of trailing zeros. However, the game is about reversing digits and then concatenating numbers, which can significantly change the outcome.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number. This is not relevant to the game's rules, which involve reversing digits and then concatenating numbers.

3. **Incorrect Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the total number of digits minus the sum of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1` to determine the winner. This is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be based on the final number formed after all moves, not just the total number of digits.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, you need to simulate the game or use a more strategic approach to understand the optimal moves for both players. Here's a high-level outline of the correct approach:

1. **Anna's Move**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of one number in the list. This can change the number significantly, but the key is to understand how this affects the final concatenated number.

2. **Sasha's Move**:
   - Sasha concatenates two numbers in the list. The optimal strategy for Sasha is to concatenate the largest possible numbers to maximize the final number.

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list. Sasha wins if this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\). Otherwise, Anna wins.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
Here is a more correct approach to solving the problem:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_sasha_win(array, m):
    while len(array) > 1:
        # Anna's turn: reverse one number
        array[0] = reverse_number(array[0])
        
        # Sasha's turn: concatenate two numbers
        array.sort(reverse=True)
        new_number = int(str(array[0]) + str(array[1]))
        array = [new_number] + array[2:]
    
    # Check if the final number is >= 10^m
    return array[0] >= 10**m

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if can_sasha_win(array, m):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **`reverse_number` Function**: This function reverses the digits of a number.
- **`can_sasha_win` Function**: This function simulates the game. It alternates between Anna's and Sasha's moves until only one number remains, then checks if this number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
- **Main Loop**: For each test case, it reads the input, simulates the game, and determines the winner.

This approach correctly follows the game rules and should produce the correct output for the given problem.
