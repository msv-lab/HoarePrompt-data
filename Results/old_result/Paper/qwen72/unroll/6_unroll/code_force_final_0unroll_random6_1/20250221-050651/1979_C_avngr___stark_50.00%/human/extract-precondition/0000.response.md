It seems there is a mismatch in the function definition provided for the problem description. The function `func_1(numbers)` does not align with the problem of distributing coins in a game with multiple outcomes and multipliers. The correct function definition for the problem should be:

```python
def distribute_coins(n, k):
```

Given this, here is the precondition for the problem:

Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of outcomes, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. k is a list of n integers representing the multipliers for each outcome, where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
