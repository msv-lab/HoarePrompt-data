Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - The current value of `den` after the update is less than or equal to 0.
   - `vals` remains unchanged.
   - `N` remains unchanged.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` (before the update) divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `den` is initially some value, and it is updated by subtracting the sum of `vprod` from it.
   - `vprod` is a list where each element is calculated as `den / vals[i]` for each element in `vals`.
   - After the update, `den` is less than or equal to 0.

3. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1)
   ```

4. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of `den`, `vals`, `N`, and `vprod` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print `-1` regardless of the values of `den`, `vals`, `N`, or `vprod`.

Output: **-1**
