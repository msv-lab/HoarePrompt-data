Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where in each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence of `l` that is non-negative, and then computes a value using this maximum sum and `k`. The final result for each test case is printed, which is the value `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`, where `maxi` is the maximum sum of the non-negative contiguous subsequence. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not modified and are re-read for each test case. **
