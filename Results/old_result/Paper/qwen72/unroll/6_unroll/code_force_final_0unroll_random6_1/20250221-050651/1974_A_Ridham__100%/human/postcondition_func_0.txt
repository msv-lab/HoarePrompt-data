The function `func` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. It calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` units of space for one type of element and `y` units of space for another type of element, where each screen can hold up to 15 units of space for the second type of element. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The final state of the program is that `n` lines have been printed, each containing the number of screens required for the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` are not modified by the function.
