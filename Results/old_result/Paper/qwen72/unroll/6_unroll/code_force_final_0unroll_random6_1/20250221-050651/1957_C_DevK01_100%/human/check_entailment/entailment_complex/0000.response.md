### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the value of `n` based on whether the move is a diagonal move (`a == b`) or not (`a != b`).

2. **Update of `n` Based on Moves:**
   - If the move is not on the diagonal (`a != b`), both the row and column are blocked, so `n` is decremented by 2.
   - If the move is on the diagonal (`a == b`), only one row (or column) is blocked, so `n` is decremented by 1.
   - This logic is correct as it accurately reflects the number of available positions for future moves after the initial `k` moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` with the values `[1, 1]`, which are the base cases for the sequence.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
   - The formula is correct for calculating the number of ways to place rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks attack each other, considering the constraints of the problem.
   - The `dp.pop(0)` ensures that the list `dp` only keeps the last two computed values, optimizing memory usage.

4. **Output and Final Configuration:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.
   - The final configuration count is correctly computed and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate and the memory optimization is well-implemented.
