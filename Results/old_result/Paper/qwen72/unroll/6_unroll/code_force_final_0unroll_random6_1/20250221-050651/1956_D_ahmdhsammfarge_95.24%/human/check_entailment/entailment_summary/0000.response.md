### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a sublist, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the sublist to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **`func_1(lst)`:**
     - This function aims to find the indices `r` and `l` of a sublist such that the sum of the elements outside this sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized.
     - The function iterates over all possible sublists and calculates the potential new sum if the elements in the sublist are set to the MEX value.
     - The function returns the indices of the sublist that maximizes this sum.

   - **`func_2(r, l, ops)`:**
     - This function recursively appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list multiple times.
     - The number of times the operation is appended is `2^(l - r)`.
     - This function is used to generate a series of operations to ensure that the MEX value is applied to the sublist multiple times.

   - **`func_3(r, l, lst, ops)`:**
     - This function applies the operation to the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` by setting all elements in this sublist to the MEX value.
     - The MEX value is determined by the length of the sublist, `n = l - r + 1`.
     - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list at least twice, and a third time if the minimum value in the sublist is 0.
     - The function then sets all elements in the sublist to `n` and returns the modified list.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic starts by reading the input and initializing the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal sublist to modify.
   - If the indices `r` and `l` are different, it calls `func_3` to apply the operation and update the list and operations.
   - The loop continues until no more optimal sublists are found (`r == l`).
   - After the loop, it tries to replace any remaining 0s in the list with 1s, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum of the elements and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Sublist Selection and MEX Calculation:**
  - `func_1` correctly identifies the optimal sublist to maximize the sum of the array.
  - The MEX value is correctly determined by the length of the sublist in `func_3`.

- **Operation Application:**
  - `func_3` correctly applies the operation to the sublist and updates the list and operations.
  - The function ensures that the MEX value is applied multiple times to ensure the maximum sum is achieved.

- **Handling Remaining 0s:**
  - The main logic correctly handles any remaining 0s in the list by replacing them with 1s, which is a valid operation to maximize the sum.

- **Operation Count:**
  - The number of operations is limited to 500,000, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by applying the specified operations. The functions work together to achieve the goal, and the main logic ensures that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum while adhering to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
