You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5` and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `n` will be 0, and the variable `s` will be the list representation of the last binary string input. The variables `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be updated based on the last binary string input, where `zeroes` is the count of '0's in the last string, `cnt` is a list with two elements representing the counts of '0's and '1's in the last string, and `ans` is the computed answer for the last string. The number of test cases `t` and the sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, counts the number of '0's and '1's in the string, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. The function prints the computed value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `s` will contain the list representation of the last binary string input, and `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will reflect the state and results of the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
101011

Expected Output:
5

Actual Output:
6
```

The expected output is 5, as the optimal strategy involves the following operations:
1. Choose substring [2, 3]: 101011 → 110011 (cost = 2)
2. Choose substring [3, 4]: 110011 → 111001 (cost = 2)
3. Choose substring [4, 6]: 111001 → 111010 → 111100 (cost = 3)

The total cost is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.

However, the program outputs 6, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
