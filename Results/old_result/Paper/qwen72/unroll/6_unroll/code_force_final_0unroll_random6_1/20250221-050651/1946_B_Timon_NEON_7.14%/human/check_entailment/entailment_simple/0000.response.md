### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the number of operations `k`, and then reads the array `a`.

2. **Maximum Segment Sum Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `a`.
   - However, the implementation of `func_2` has several issues:
     - It initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` incorrectly. `max_segment` is initialized as `[0, 0]`, but it should be initialized to store the maximum sum and the start and end indices of the segment.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where `new_segment` is empty and the current element is negative.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are not valid segments (e.g., `new_segment` is an empty list).
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the array are negative, leading to an incorrect result.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula assumes that the maximum segment sum is always positive, which is not always the case.
   - The program also handles the case where `max_segment[0]` is `-1` by setting it to `0`, but this is not the correct way to handle an empty or negative segment.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly applies the modulo operation to the final answer.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` is defined but not used in the program. It is incomplete and does not contribute to the solution.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the implementation of `func_2` and the incorrect handling of negative segments, the program is **not correct** for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
