Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought `k` is less than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day `m`. In such a scenario, the program incorrectly calculates the cost by considering `m` tickets, which is more than `k`.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
5 10 3
1 2 3 4 5
```
Here, `n = 5`, `m = 10`, and `k = 3`. The prices per ticket are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The optimal way to buy 3 tickets is to buy all 3 tickets on the first day, which would cost 3 * 1 = 3. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost as if it were buying `m` tickets, which is 10, leading to an incorrect result.

The logic in the program should be adjusted to handle cases where `k` is less than `m` more carefully. Specifically, it should not assume that `m` tickets are always bought, but rather consider the actual number of tickets needed.
