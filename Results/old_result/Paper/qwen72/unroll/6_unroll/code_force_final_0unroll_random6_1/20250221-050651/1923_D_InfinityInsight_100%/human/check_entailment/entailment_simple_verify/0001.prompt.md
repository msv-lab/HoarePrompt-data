You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` slimes in a line, each with a size `a_i`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report `-1` if it is impossible.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function is used to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `left` that is greater than or equal to a given value `x`.
     - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point of `x` in the sorted array `a`.
     - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index + 1.
     - Otherwise, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted.
     - This function is used to determine the earliest point where a slime can be eaten by a larger slime.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function processes the array of slime sizes `a` and returns an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the minimum number of seconds it takes for the `i`-th slime to be eaten.
     - **Initialization**:
       - `left` is a prefix sum array that keeps track of the cumulative sum of slime sizes.
       - `last` is an array that keeps track of the last index of a slime with a different size than the current one.
       - `ans` is initialized to `-1` for all slimes, indicating that initially, we assume no slime can be eaten.
     - **Main Loop**:
       - For each slime `i`:
         - If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, the `i`-th slime can be eaten by the `i-1`-th slime in 1 second, so `ans[i] = 1`.
         - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as the cumulative sum of sizes up to the `i`-th slime minus the size of the `i`-th slime minus 1.
         - It uses `func_1` to find the earliest index `inx` where the cumulative sum is at least `x`.
         - It also checks `last[i - 1]` to ensure that the slime at `i` can be eaten by a slime that is not of the same size.
         - If `inx` is valid, it updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where a slime can be eaten by a larger neighbor in 1 second.
   - The use of the prefix sum array `left` and the `last` array helps in efficiently finding the earliest point where a slime can be eaten.
   - The logic for updating `ans[i]` based on the cumulative sum and the `last` array is sound and ensures that the minimum number of seconds is calculated correctly.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime, returning `-1` for such slimes.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
