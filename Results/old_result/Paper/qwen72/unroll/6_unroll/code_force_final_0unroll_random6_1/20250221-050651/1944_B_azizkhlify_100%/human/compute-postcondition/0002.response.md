The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with the following inputs: `t`, an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k`, integers for each test case where 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4 and 1 <= k <= floor(n/2); and `a`, a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= n and each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice in `a`.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs. The exact nature of the return value is not specified, but it is expected to be derived from the inputs `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of 2n integers. It returns a result for each test case, where the result is based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the structure of the list `a`.**
