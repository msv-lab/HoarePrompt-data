Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the remainder of a given integer `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to ensure that the final answer is within the required modulo constraints.
   - The function is straightforward and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in the array `arr`.
   - However, the function has a few issues:
     - It initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` incorrectly. `max_segment` should be initialized to `[-1, 0]` to represent an invalid segment, and `new_segment` should be initialized to an empty list or a list with a single element.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `segments_variants` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has all negative numbers.
     - The function appends `new_segment` and `max_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are invalid (i.e., `new_segment` is an empty list or `max_segment` is `[-1, 0]`).
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty or all elements are negative.
     - The function does not return the start and end indices of the segment, only the sum, which is not consistent with the comment.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and then use this sum to compute the final answer.
   - The formula used in the main logic is `answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`. This formula is intended to account for the sum of the original array and the sum of the subarray added `2^k` times.
   - However, the formula is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where the maximum segment sum is zero or negative. It also does not correctly account for the modulo operation.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is not used in the main logic and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful computation.

Given the issues in `func_2` and the main logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
