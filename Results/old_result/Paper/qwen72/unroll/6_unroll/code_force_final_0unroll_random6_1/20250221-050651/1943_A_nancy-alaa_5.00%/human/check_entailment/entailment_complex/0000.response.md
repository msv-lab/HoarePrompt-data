### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where Alice and Bob play optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob will both try to influence the MEX by their choices.
   - Alice will try to pick elements that prevent Bob from minimizing the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick elements that prevent Alice from maximizing the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.

4. **Key Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the range `[0, n)` to find the first integer `i` that either:
     - Does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
     - Appears exactly once and `first` is `True` (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1 and first`).
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether a unique integer has been found in the array.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking if an integer `i` is missing from the array.
   - The `first` variable ensures that if a unique integer is found, the next unique integer is considered, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The program handles the input constraints and multiple test cases correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present in the array.
   - It also handles cases where there are multiple occurrences of integers and where the array has unique integers.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, considering the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
