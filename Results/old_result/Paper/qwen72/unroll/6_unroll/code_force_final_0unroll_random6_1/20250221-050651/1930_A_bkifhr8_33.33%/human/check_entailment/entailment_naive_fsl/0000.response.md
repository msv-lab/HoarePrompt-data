Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the logic for selecting and removing the minimum values from the list. Specifically, the program always selects the first two elements of the list and removes them, which is not optimal for maximizing the score. Additionally, the way elements are removed from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` is incorrect and will not work as intended.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
1 3 2 4
```
The correct output should be `3` (by selecting pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4)), but the program will output `2` because it always selects the first two elements and removes them, leading to suboptimal results.

A correct approach would involve sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements, as the minimum value of each pair will always be one of the smallest `n` elements in the sorted list.
