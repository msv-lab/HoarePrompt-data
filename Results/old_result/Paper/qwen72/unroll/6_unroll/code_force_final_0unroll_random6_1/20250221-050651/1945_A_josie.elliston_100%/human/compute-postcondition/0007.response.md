Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, both within the range 0 to 10^9. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3. **
