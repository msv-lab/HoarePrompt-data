Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are greater than or equal to the square root of `x`, followed by all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order. The input `x` remains unchanged. **
