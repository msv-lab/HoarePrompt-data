Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly implement the problem description. Here are the specific issues and their implications:

1. **MEX Calculation in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to maximize the sum of the array by computing the MEX value for the chosen range. However, it incorrectly calculates the sum `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This is not the MEX value, but rather a heuristic that sums the elements outside the range and adds the square of the range length. This does not align with the problem's requirement to compute the MEX value and update the elements in the range to this MEX value.

2. **Operations in `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` is supposed to update the elements in the range `[r, l]` to the MEX value and record the operations. However, it updates the elements to `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), which is the length of the range, not the MEX value. This is incorrect because the MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the range, not the length of the range.

3. **Redundant Operations:**
   - The function `func_3` appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to more operations than allowed. The problem specifies that no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations should be used, and redundant operations can easily exceed this limit.

4. **Handling of Zeros:**
   - The function `func_3` checks if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0 and appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` a third time if it is. This is not a correct approach to handling zeros in the sublist. The MEX value should be computed and used to update the elements, regardless of whether the minimum value is 0.

5. **Final Loop to Replace Zeros:**
   - The final loop in the main program attempts to replace zeros in the list with 1. This is a last-ditch effort to correct the array, but it is not a systematic or correct way to achieve the maximum sum. The MEX value should be computed and used to update the elements in the range, not just replacing zeros with 1.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly compute the MEX value and update the array elements as required by the problem description. The provided example input and expected output further confirm this:

**Input:**
```
3
0 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6 1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not correctly compute the MEX value for the range `[1, 3]` and will not update the array elements to the MEX value. Instead, it will perform incorrect operations and may not achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
