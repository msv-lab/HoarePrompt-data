You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits (integers) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The values of t and q remain unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the values of a, b, and c are updated based on user input, and the loop prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' depending on the conditions. After all iterations, the final values of a, b, and c are the last input values provided by the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
   
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This is the correct condition for a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem.

5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which is consistent with the problem's output format.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), it will print "NONE" because neither a stair nor a peak can be formed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
