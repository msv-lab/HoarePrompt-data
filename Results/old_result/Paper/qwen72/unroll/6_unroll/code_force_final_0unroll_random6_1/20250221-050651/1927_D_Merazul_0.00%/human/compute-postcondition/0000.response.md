The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function does not directly change any of the variables in the initial state, but it prepares a way to read and convert input values into integers.

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query is a pair of integers (l, r) where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `R` is a function that reads a space-separated list of integers from input.**
