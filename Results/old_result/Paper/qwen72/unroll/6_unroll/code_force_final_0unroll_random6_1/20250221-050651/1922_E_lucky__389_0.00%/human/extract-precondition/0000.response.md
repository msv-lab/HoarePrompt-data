Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) representing the number of increasing subsequences required. The function should return a list of t elements, where each element is either -1 if no such array exists, or a list of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences. All elements of the array should be in the range [-10^9; 10^9].**
