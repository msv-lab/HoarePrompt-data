### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop. This is done to ignore free cells that are to the left of all chips.
   - Similarly, it removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop. This is done to ignore free cells that are to the right of all chips.
   - These steps are necessary because the goal is to form a single block of chips without any free cells between them, and leading or trailing zeros do not affect the operations needed to achieve this.

3. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros, the program iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of free cells (i.e., cells with `0`).
   - The number of free cells counted is the number of operations required to move all chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. This is because each free cell in the middle of the list represents a gap that needs to be filled by moving a chip.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of operations required.

### Analysis of the Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `8`, `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 1
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `6`, `0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `6`, `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 0
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `5`, `1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 2
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `9`, `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
   - Free cells in the middle: 3
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
- The function `func` does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem description that requires printing the results.
- The function correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when there are no free cells between the chips or when the chips are already in a single block.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem by removing leading and trailing zeros and then counting the free cells in the middle. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations required to form a single block of chips is calculated accurately.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
