Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then compares these distances to determine the area of the square. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the points are correctly identified as the corners of the square.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
0 0
0 2
2 0
2 2
```
The correct area of the square is 4, but the program will output 8. This is because the program calculates the squared distance between (0, 0) and (2, 2) (which is 8) and between (0, 2) and (2, 0) (which is also 8), and then prints the smaller of these two values, which is still 8.

The correct approach would be to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two points that are not on the same diagonal. This can be done by checking the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates separately and then using the larger of these differences to calculate the area.
