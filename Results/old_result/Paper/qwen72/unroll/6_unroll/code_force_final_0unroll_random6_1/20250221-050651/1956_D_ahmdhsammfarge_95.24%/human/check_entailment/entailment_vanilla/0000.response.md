### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function is designed to find the optimal subarray to replace with its MEX value to maximize the sum.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX value.
   - The MEX value of a subarray is implicitly calculated as \((j - i + 1)^2\) because the MEX value of a subarray of length \(k\) is \(k\) if the subarray contains all integers from 0 to \(k-1\).
   - The function returns the indices of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is designed to generate a sequence of operations to replace the subarray from index `r` to `l` with its MEX value.
   - It recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to ensure that the subarray is replaced correctly.
   - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops` and then recursively calls itself to handle the subarray from `r` to `l - 1`.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function is designed to perform the actual replacement of the subarray from index `r` to `l` with its MEX value and generate the corresponding operations.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the list `ops`.
   - If the minimum value in the subarray is 0, it appends the operation again to ensure the subarray is correctly replaced.
   - It then appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to handle the case where the subarray is a single element.
   - It calls `func_2` to generate the remaining operations.
   - Finally, it updates the subarray in `lst` with the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` together aim to maximize the sum of the array by replacing subarrays with their MEX values.
   - However, the approach in `func_1` is not correct. It assumes that the MEX value of a subarray of length \(k\) is always \(k\), which is not true. The MEX value depends on the actual elements in the subarray.
   - The recursive approach in `func_2` and `func_3` is also not optimal. It generates too many operations, which can exceed the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX value calculation in `func_1` is incorrect, and the recursive operations in `func_2` and `func_3` are not efficient enough to ensure the solution is within the allowed operation limit.

**Correctness: False**
