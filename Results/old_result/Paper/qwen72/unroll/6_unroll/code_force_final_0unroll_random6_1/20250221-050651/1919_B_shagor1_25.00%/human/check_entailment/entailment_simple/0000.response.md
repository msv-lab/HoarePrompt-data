### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The program counts the number of "-" characters in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`.
   - The penalty is calculated using the formula `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

3. **Optimal Splitting:**
   - The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays such that each subarray has a sum of zero. This is because the penalty of a subarray with a sum of zero is zero.
   - If the entire array has a sum of zero, the penalty is zero.
   - If the entire array does not have a sum of zero, the penalty is minimized by splitting the array into subarrays of length 1, which results in a penalty of `n` (since each subarray of length 1 has a penalty of 1).

4. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the fact that each "+" contributes 1 to the sum and each "-" contributes -1.
   - The total sum of the array `a` is `n - 2 * neg` because there are `n` characters in total, and `neg` of them are "-", each subtracting 2 from the total sum.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the array can be split into subarrays with a sum of zero, and the penalty is `n - 2 * neg`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, the array consists entirely of "-", and the penalty is `n` (since each subarray of length 1 has a penalty of 1).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where the string `s` consists entirely of "+" or "-" correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty based on the problem description. The formula used is correct and the program handles all edge cases as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
