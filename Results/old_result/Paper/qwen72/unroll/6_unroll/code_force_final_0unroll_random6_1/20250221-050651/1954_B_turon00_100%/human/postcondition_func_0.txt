The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array. If the array has only one element or all elements are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum count. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables used within the function are no longer in use.
