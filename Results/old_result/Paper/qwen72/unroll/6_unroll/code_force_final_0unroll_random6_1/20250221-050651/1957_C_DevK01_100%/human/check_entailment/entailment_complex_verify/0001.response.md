### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the number of remaining valid positions on the board.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program correctly checks if `a` is not equal to `b` for each move `(a, b)`.
   - If `a != b`, it means the computer will place a rook at `(b, a)`, which is a different position. Therefore, both positions `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 2.
   - If `a == b`, the computer skips its turn, and only one position `(a, a)` is occupied, reducing the number of available positions by 1.
   - This logic is correctly implemented and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations for the remaining `n` positions.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`, representing the base cases where there are 1 way to place 0 rooks and 1 way to place 1 rook.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, the DP array is updated using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is correct for counting the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on a board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place `i-1` rooks and leave one row and one column free.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place the `i`-th rook in one of the `i-1` free rows and columns, and then place the remaining `i-2` rooks in the remaining `i-2` rows and columns.
   - The rolling array technique used (`dp.pop(0)`) is efficient and ensures that only the last two computed values are stored, which is sufficient for the DP formula.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). This is correct as the program updates `n` based on the moves and ensures it remains within the valid range.
  - The function `func_1(n)` is called with the updated `n`.

- **Function `func_1(n)`:**
  - The DP array `dp` is initialized correctly.
  - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array using the correct formula.
  - The rolling array technique (`dp.pop(0)`) is used to maintain only the last two values, which is efficient and correct.
  - The function returns the value of `dp[n]`, which is the last computed value in the DP array.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. The input handling, move processing, dynamic programming, and output are all implemented correctly and align with the problem requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: True**
