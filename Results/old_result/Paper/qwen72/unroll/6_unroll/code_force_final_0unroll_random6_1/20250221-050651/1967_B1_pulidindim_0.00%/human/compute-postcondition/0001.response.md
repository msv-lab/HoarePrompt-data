The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 0. The conditions for `n` and `m` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but they are important for the function's correctness and constraints.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
