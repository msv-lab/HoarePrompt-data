Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. For example, if the input is:

```
2
3
5 5 5
```

The program will output:

```
-1
```

However, a valid solution exists for this case. One possible solution is to bet 1 coin on each outcome, which would result in:

```
1 1 1
```

This is because the total amount of coins bet is 3, and if any outcome wins, you will receive back \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \) coins, which is strictly greater than 3. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
