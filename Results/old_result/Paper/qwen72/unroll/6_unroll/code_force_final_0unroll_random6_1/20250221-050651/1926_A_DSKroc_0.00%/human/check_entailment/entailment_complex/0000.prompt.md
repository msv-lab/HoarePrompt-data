Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting only of the characters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct. The function should output the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to stdout.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive. The function `func` has read `t` distinct strings of length 5 from stdin, and for each string, it has counted the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. The loop has completed all iterations, and the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string has been output to stdout. The variables `ac` and `bc` are reset to 0 at the start of each iteration, so their final values are 0. For the last string processed, if the number of 'A' characters (`ac`) is greater than the number of 'B' characters (`bc`), then 'A' is the most frequent character and has been output to stdout. Otherwise, 'B' is the most frequent character or both 'A' and 'B' are equally frequent, and 'B' has been output to stdout.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 32. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads a string of length 5 containing only the characters 'A' and 'B'. The function then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and outputs the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string to standard output. If the number of 'A' and 'B' characters is equal in a string, the function outputs 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function has no further effect on the program state.
