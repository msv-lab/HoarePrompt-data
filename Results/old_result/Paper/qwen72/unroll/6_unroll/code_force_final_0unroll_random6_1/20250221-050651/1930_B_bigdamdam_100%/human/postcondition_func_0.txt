The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of a permutation. For each test case, it generates and prints a permutation of length `n` where the permutation alternates between the largest and smallest remaining numbers, starting with the largest. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the required permutations for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` and the sum of all `n` values across test cases remain unchanged.
