You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the game rules and the winning conditions. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, which are not the correct criteria for determining the winner.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list and the number of trailing zeros in each number. However, the game rules do not require this. The game is about reversing digits and concatenating numbers, not about counting digits or trailing zeros.

2. **Incorrect Winning Condition**:
   - The program uses the condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` to determine the winner. This condition is based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros, which is not aligned with the game rules. The correct condition should be based on the final number in the list after all moves are made and whether it is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

3. **Handling of Reversals and Concatenations**:
   - The program does not simulate the actual game moves (reversing digits and concatenating numbers). Instead, it relies on a simplified and incorrect logic.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following test case:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description:
- Anna can reverse either 14 or 2.
- If Anna reverses 14, it becomes 41.
- If Anna reverses 2, it remains 2.
- Sasha then concatenates the two numbers. If Anna reversed 14, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). If Anna reversed 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is also greater than \(10^2 = 100\).

The correct output should be "Sasha" because Sasha can always win by concatenating the numbers in such a way that the final number is greater than \(10^2\).

However, the provided program calculates:
- Total digits: 3 (1 + 2)
- Trailing zeros: 0 (since neither 14 nor 2 has trailing zeros)
- `subtract_zero` is 0
- `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) = 3` which is not greater than or equal to \(m + 1 = 3\)

Thus, the program incorrectly outputs "Anna" for this case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly simulate the game as described and fails to determine the winner based on the correct criteria. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
