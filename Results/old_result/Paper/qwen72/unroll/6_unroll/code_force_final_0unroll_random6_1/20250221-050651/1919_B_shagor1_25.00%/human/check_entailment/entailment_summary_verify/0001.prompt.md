You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-". s
represents an array a of length n defined by a_i=1 if s_i= "+" and a_i=-1 if
s_i= "-".

You will do the following process to calculate your penalty:

  1. Split a into non-empty arrays b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k such that b_1+b_2+\ldots+b_k=a^\dagger , where + denotes array concatenation. 
  2. The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array c of length m , its penalty is calculated as p(c)=|c_1+c_2+\ldots+c_m| \cdot m . 
  3. The total penalty that you will receive is p(b_1)+p(b_2)+\ldots+p(b_k) . 

If you perform the above process optimally, find the minimum possible penalty
you will receive.

^\dagger Some valid ways to split a=[3,1,4,1,5] into (b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_k) are
([3],[1],[4],[1],[5]) , ([3,1],[4,1,5]) and ([3,1,4,1,5]) while some invalid
ways to split a are ([3,1],[1,5]) , ([3],[\,],[1,4],[1,5]) and ([3,4],[5,1,1])
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the length of string s .

The second line of each test case contains string s (s_i \in \\{ \mathtt{+},
\mathtt{-} \\} , |s| = n ).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of n over all test cases.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer representing the minimum possible
penalty you will receive.

Note

In the first test case, we have a=[1] . We can split array a into ([1]) .
Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is p([1]) = 1 .

In the second test case, we have a=[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1] . We can split array a
into ([-1],[-1],[-1],[-1],[-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays
is p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) + p([-1]) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 .

In the third test case, we have a=[1,-1,1,-1,1,-1] . We can split array a into
([1,-1,1,-1],[1,-1]) . Then, the sum of penalties of the subarrays is
p([1,-1,1,-1]) + p([1,-1]) = 0 + 0 = 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    func_1()
    t -= 1

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It counts the number of "-" characters in `s` and prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed result and the unchanged values of `n` and `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in `s` corresponds to an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - We need to split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that each `+` contributes `1` to the sum and each `-` contributes `-1`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, it means there are some `+` characters in the string.
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to pair each `+` with a `-` as much as possible, which results in subarrays with a sum of `0` and a penalty of `0`.
   - The remaining characters (if any) will form subarrays with a penalty of `1` for each character.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` accounts for the number of `+` and `-` pairs, and the remaining characters.

4. **Special Case**:
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters.
   - In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to have each `-` in its own subarray, resulting in a penalty of `1` for each subarray.
   - Therefore, the total penalty is `n`.

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For the first test case: `s = "+"`, `n = 1`, `neg = 0`. The formula gives `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case: `s = "-----"`, `n = 5`, `neg = 5`. The formula gives `5` because `n == neg`.
   - For the third test case: `s = "+-+-+-"`, `n = 6`, `neg = 3`. The formula gives `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case: `s = "--+++++++-"`, `n = 10`, `neg = 2`. The formula gives `10 - 2 * 2 = 6`, but the correct answer should be `4` because we can split it into `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]` and `[1]`, resulting in a penalty of `4`.
   - For the fifth test case: `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, `n = 20`, `neg = 8`. The formula gives `20 - 2 * 8 = 4`, which is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution is incorrect for the fourth test case because it does not account for the optimal way to pair `+` and `-` characters to minimize the penalty.
