#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99, inclusive.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is equal to the sorted list `sorted_lst`. If `lst` was already sorted in ascending order, the program returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns a boolean value. It returns `True` if the list `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.
