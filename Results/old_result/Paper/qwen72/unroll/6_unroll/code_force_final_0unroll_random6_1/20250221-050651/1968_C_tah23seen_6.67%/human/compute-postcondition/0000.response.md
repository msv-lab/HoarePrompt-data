Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500 and len(arr) == n - 1, `ans` is a list of n zeros.** 

The list `ans` is initialized to contain `n` zeros, while the initial conditions for `arr` and `n` remain unchanged.
