The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`. `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. After executing the function body, the elements in `lst` from index `r` to index `l` are all set to `n`, where `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`, and the rest of the list remains unchanged. The function returns the modified list `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It sets the elements in `lst` from index `r` to index `l` to the value `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), and returns the modified list `lst`.**
