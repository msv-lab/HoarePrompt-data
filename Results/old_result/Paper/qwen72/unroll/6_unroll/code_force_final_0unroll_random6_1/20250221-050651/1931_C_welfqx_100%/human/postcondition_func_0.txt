The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `a` to make it a palindrome. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the initial values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the function has printed the required output for each test case.
