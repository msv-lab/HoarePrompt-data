Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`, followed by the list `lst` of `2n` integers. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Splitting the List**: The list `lst` is split into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, which are the first `n` and the last `n` elements of `lst`, respectively. This is in line with the problem description.

3. **Sorting the Lists**: Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. Sorting is necessary to easily find pairs of duplicate elements.

4. **Finding Duplicates and Singles**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted `lft` list to find pairs of duplicate elements and appends them to `ldb`. If a single element is found (i.e., an element that does not have a pair in the current iteration), it is appended to `sng`.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted `rgt` list to find pairs of duplicate elements and appends them to `rdb`.

5. **Printing the Results**:
   - The function prints up to `k` elements from `ldb` and `sng` for the `l` array. If there are enough pairs in `ldb`, it prints them. If not, it prints the remaining single elements from `sng`.
   - Similarly, the function prints up to `k` elements from `rdb` and `sng` for the `r` array.

6. **Ensuring XOR Equality**:
   - The function aims to print pairs of duplicate elements first, which ensures that the XOR of these pairs is `0` (since `x \oplus x = 0`).
   - If pairs are not sufficient, it prints single elements from `sng`. However, the function does not explicitly ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`.

7. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function does not handle the case where the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` might not be equal if there are not enough pairs and the single elements are not chosen correctly.
   - The function does not check if the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal before printing them, which is a requirement of the problem.

Given these points, the function does not guarantee that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` will be equal, which is a critical requirement of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
