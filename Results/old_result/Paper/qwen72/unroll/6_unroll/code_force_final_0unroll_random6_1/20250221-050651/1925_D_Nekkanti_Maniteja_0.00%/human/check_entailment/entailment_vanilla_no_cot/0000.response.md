Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem:

1. **Calculation of the Probability**: The probability of selecting a pair of friends is calculated as `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`. However, this is incorrect because it should be `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` since the total number of possible pairs is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The program should calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion, considering the increase in friendship values for subsequent excursions.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The program should handle modular arithmetic correctly, especially when dealing with the sum and the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values
        for i in range(k):
            s = (s + c * (a + i * m)) % M
        
        print(s)

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Total Pairs Calculation**: `total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the total number of possible pairs of children.
2. **Probability Calculation**: `c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)` correctly calculates the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The loop `for i in range(k)` correctly updates the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion, considering the increase in friendship values for subsequent excursions.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
