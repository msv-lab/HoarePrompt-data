You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, the output is a list of integers `ans` of length `n`, where the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2, and any remaining positions in the list are filled with zeros. The loop has finished executing, and all variables within the loop body have been reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The elements in `ans` are powers of 2, and any remaining positions in the list are filled with zeros. The function prints the list `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that all test cases have been processed and their respective lists have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Bitwise Analysis**: The program uses a loop to analyze the binary representation of `k` to identify the positions of the bits that are set to 1. This is done using the bitwise AND operation (`k & 1`) and right shift operation (`k >> 1`). The positions of these bits are stored in the list `arr`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of integers.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.
   - The program then iterates over the positions of the bits set to 1 in `k` (stored in `arr`).
   - For each bit position, it adds `1 << i` to `ans` (which is a number with a single bit set at position `i`).
   - If the counter `c` reaches `n - 1`, it adds the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

4. **Padding with Zeros**: If the number of elements in `ans` is less than `n`, the program pads the list with zeros to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Condition 1**: The sum of the sequence should be equal to `k`.
  - The program ensures this by adding the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the last element of `ans` if the number of elements is `n - 1`.
  - This guarantees that the sum of the sequence will be exactly `k`.

- **Condition 2**: The number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence should be maximized.
  - By setting the bits at the positions identified in `arr`, the program ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s.
  - The use of `1 << i` ensures that each bit position is set exactly once, which maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Sequence**: If `n` is 1, the program correctly outputs `k` as the only element.
- **Multiple Elements**: For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and the number of 1s in the OR result is maximized by setting the bits at the positions identified in `arr`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.
