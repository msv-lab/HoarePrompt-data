Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and the elements of the array a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def min_penalty(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
