Precondition: **n is a positive integer such that 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not include the variable `k`, which is essential for the problem. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 \leq k \leq 10^9.**
