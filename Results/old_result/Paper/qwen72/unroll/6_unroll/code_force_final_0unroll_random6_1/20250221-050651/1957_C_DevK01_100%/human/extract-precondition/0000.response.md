Precondition: **n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take more parameters to handle the moves and the number of test cases. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and a list of moves `k` made. Each move is represented as a tuple `(r_i, c_i)`.

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, test_cases is a list of length t, where each element is a tuple (n, moves) such that n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and moves is a list of k tuples (r_i, c_i) where 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**
