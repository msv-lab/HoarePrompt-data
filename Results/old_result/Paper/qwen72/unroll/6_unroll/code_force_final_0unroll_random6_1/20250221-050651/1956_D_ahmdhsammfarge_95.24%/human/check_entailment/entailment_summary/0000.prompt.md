Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:

lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
ops = []
(r, l) = func_1(lst)
while r != l:
    lst = func_3(r, l, lst, ops)
    (r, l) = func_1(lst)
try:
    while True:
        i = lst.index(0) + 1
        lst[i - 1] = 1
        ops.append([i, i])
except ValueError:
    pass
print(sum(lst), len(ops))
for r in ops:
    print(*r)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(lst):
    r = l = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                (r, l) = [i, j]
                over_sum = sm
    return (r, l)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the start and end indices of a sublist in `lst` such that the sum of the elements outside this sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized. The function ensures that `r` and `l` are the indices that achieve this maximum sum, and `over_sum` holds the maximum value of this sum.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(r, l, ops: list):
    if r == l:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
        return
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    func_2(r, l - 1, ops)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two non-negative integers `r` and `l` where `r` is less than or equal to `l`, and a list `ops` that can contain sublists of two integers. It modifies the `ops` list by appending sublists of the form `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, depending on the difference between `r` and `l`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `ops` list will contain a series of sublists, each of which is `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and the number of such sublists will be `2^(l - r)`. The original values of `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list):
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    if min(lst[r:l + 1]) == 0:
        ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])
    func_2(r, l, ops)
    ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])
    n = l - r + 1
    lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `lst` by setting the elements from index `r` to index `l` to the value `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), and returns the modified list `lst`. Additionally, the function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list at least twice, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends this operation a third time. The rest of the list `lst` remains unchanged.
