The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, possibly in the form of a list or tuple, to handle the described inputs. The parameters are:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n`: an integer representing the length of the list `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `k`: an integer representing a value to be used in each test case, where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided parameters. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can only describe the general functionality based on the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list `a`), `k` (a value used in each test case), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
