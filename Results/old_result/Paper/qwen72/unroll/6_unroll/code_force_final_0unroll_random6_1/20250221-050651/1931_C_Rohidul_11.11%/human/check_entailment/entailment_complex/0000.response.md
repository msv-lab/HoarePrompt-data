### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively, representing the left and right pointers of the array.
   - `st` and `end` are initialized to 0, which will be used to count consecutive duplicates at the start and end of the array.

3. **Consecutive Duplicates at Start and End**:
   - The first while loop increments `l` and `st` while the elements at `l` and `l+1` are the same. This effectively moves the left pointer to the right until it finds a different element or reaches the end.
   - The second while loop decrements `r` and increments `end` while the elements at `r` and `r-1` are the same. This moves the right pointer to the left until it finds a different element or reaches the start.

4. **Determining the Minimum Cost**:
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the function calculates the cost as `r - l - 1`. This is because the subarray from `l+1` to `r-1` needs to be filled with the same value to make the entire array equal.
   - If there are no consecutive duplicates at the start and end (`st == 0 and end == 0` and `a[0] != a[-1]`), the function calculates the cost as `len(a) - 1`. This means the entire array needs to be filled with the same value.
   - Otherwise, the function calculates the cost as `r - l`. This is the length of the subarray that needs to be filled with the same value.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated value of `ans`. This ensures that the output is always non-negative.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the array is already equal (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), where the cost is 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array has only one element, where the cost is 0.
   - For arrays with different elements at the start and end, it correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. It handles all edge cases and correctly processes each test case as described in the problem statement.
