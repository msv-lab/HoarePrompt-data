Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints up to `k` elements from the first half of the list `a` and up to `k` elements from the second half of the list `a`. The elements printed are pairs of duplicates if available, or single elements if no more pairs can be printed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables used within the function are no longer relevant. **
