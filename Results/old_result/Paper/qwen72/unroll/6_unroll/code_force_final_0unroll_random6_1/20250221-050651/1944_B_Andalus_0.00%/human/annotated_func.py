#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains an integer n and an integer k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.

            if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
                ldb.append(lft[i])
            elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:

    #State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `T`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` will have been used to produce the specified output for each test case, but their final values will not be retained for the next test case. The loop will have printed pairs of elements from `ldb` and `rdb` and single elements from `sng` up to `k` elements for each half of the array, and the final state of these variables will be reset for the next iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases will still not exceed 5 · 10^4.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `2n` integers where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints up to `k` elements from the first half of the list `a` and up to `k` elements from the second half of the list `a`. The elements printed are pairs of duplicates if available, or single elements if no more pairs can be printed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables used within the function are no longer relevant.
