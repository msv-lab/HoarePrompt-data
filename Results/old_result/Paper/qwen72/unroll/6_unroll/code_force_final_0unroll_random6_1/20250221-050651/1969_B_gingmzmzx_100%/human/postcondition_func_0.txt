The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`, counts the number of '0's and '1's in the string, and computes a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. The function prints the computed value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `s` will contain the list representation of the last binary string input, and `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will reflect the state and results of the last test case.
