Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Here are the issues:

1. **Calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons:**
   - The program calculates `t` as the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that a 2x2 icon can only be placed in certain positions on the screen (i.e., it must start at a cell that is not in the last row or last column of the screen).
   - The program assumes that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and then divides by 5 to get the number of screens. This is incorrect because the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen is not a simple division by 5.

2. **Calculation of `t1` for remaining 1x1 icons:**
   - The program calculates `t1` as the number of cells left after placing the 2x2 icons. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that the remaining cells might not be contiguous and might not be able to fit all 1x1 icons.

3. **Calculation of `t2` for additional screens:**
   - The program calculates `t2` as the number of additional 1x1 icons that need to be placed and then adds the number of screens required for these icons. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that the remaining cells on the current screens might be enough to fit some of the 1x1 icons.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, considering the constraints on their placement.
2. Calculate the number of remaining cells on these screens.
3. Place the 1x1 icons in the remaining cells, and if there are not enough remaining cells, calculate the additional screens required.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + 14) // 15  # Each screen can have at most 3 2x2 icons (12 cells)
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons
        screens_for_1x1 = (a - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Each screen has 15 cells
        
        # Total number of screens required
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected program should correctly determine the minimum number of screens required for all test cases.
