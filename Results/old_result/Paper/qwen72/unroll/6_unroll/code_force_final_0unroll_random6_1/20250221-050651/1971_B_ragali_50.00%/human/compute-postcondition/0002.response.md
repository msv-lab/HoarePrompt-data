Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` is unchanged as it controls the number of iterations. Each string `s` from the input has been processed, and for each `s` where the set `a` (containing unique characters of `s`) has more than one unique character, the output is 'YES' followed by a modified version of `s`. If `s` has only one unique character, the output is 'NO'. The set `a` is reset for each iteration.**
