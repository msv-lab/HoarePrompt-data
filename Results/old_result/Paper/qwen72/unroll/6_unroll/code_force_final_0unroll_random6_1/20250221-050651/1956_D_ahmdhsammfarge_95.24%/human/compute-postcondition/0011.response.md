Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `lst` by setting the elements from index `r` to index `l` to the value `n` (where `n = l - r + 1`), and returns the modified list `lst`. Additionally, the function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list at least twice, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends this operation a third time. The rest of the list `lst` remains unchanged. **
