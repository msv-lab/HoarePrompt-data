The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The total number of test cases, `t`, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the results for each test case based on the provided inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. It returns the results for each test case based on the provided inputs, ensuring that the number of test cases `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
