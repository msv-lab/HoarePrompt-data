The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is a placeholder**
