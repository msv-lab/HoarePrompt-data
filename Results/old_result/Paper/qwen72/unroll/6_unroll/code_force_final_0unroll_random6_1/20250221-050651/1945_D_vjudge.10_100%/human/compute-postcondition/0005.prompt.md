You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a is a list of n integers where each a_i represents the cost to bribe the i-th person in the queue (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), b is a list of n integers where each b_i represents the cost to bribe each person between the i-th and the person Kirill is currently bribing (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer representing the number of people in the queue besides Kirill (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and m is an integer representing the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i < m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        
        x += min(a[i], b[i])
        
    #State: pergunta is the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to m, x is the total cost of the minimum bribes from the last person to the first person in the queue.
    print(pergunta)
    #This is printed: pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum cost to bribe people to reach a position up to m)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `pergunta`, a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `n`, and an integer `m`. It returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to bribe the people in the queue to reach a position no greater than `m`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
