Postcondition: **`ans` is a set containing all integers that can be reached by adding or subtracting multiples of `r` (from the last call of `func_1`) to the initial value `x`, modulo `n`, after `m` iterations. The size of `ans` can vary depending on the values of `r` and `c` from each call of `func_1`. The set `ans` contains the integer 0.**
