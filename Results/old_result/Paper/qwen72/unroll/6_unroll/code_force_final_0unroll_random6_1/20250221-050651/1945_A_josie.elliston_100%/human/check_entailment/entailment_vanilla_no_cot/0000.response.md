Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully address the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly handling the constraints for extroverts and universals. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - The condition `if extroverts % 3 != 0` checks if there are any leftover extroverts after forming complete groups of three. If there are, it checks if the sum of these leftover extroverts and universals is less than 3, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition. It should also ensure that the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals to form complete groups of three.

2. **Handling Introverts:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts to the result, as each introvert needs a separate tent.

3. **Output for Impossible Cases:**
   - The function `func_2` returns -1 if `func_1` returns `None`, which is correct for impossible cases. However, `func_1` does not always correctly identify impossible cases.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the number of extroverts can be fully accommodated with the help of universals, and then calculate the total number of tents required. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_tents(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    # Each introvert needs a separate tent
    tents_for_introverts = introverts
    
    # Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others
    if extroverts * 2 > universals:
        # If there are not enough universals to pair with extroverts, it's impossible
        return -1
    
    # Use universals to pair with extroverts
    universals -= extroverts * 2
    tents_for_extroverts = extroverts
    
    # Remaining universals can be grouped in any way
    tents_for_universals = ceil(universals / 3)
    
    # Total number of tents needed
    total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_extroverts + tents_for_universals
    return total_tents

# Reading input and processing test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
    print(min_tents(a, b, c))
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- Each introvert gets a separate tent.
- Each extrovert is paired with two others, and there are enough universals to do so.
- Remaining universals are grouped in the most efficient way possible.

This should correctly handle all the test cases provided in the problem description.
