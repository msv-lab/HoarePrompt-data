Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Note

In the first example, all subsegments are good.

In the second example, good subsegments start at positions 1 , 2 , and 3 .

In the third example, good subsegments start at positions 1 and 2 .

    #State: The loop iterates `nabors` times, and for each iteration, it processes new inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `bb`. After each iteration, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `bb` are updated with new values from the input. The variables `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `tot`, and `fnd` are recalculated for each iteration. The final output state is that `fnd` is printed for each iteration, representing the number of times the condition `tot >= k` is met during the processing of the lists `aa` and `bb`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, and `bb` are reset for the next iteration, and the loop continues until all `nabors` iterations are completed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `nabors` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` and two lists of integers `aa` and `bb` from the input. It then calculates the number of times a condition is met: the condition is that at least `k` elements from the first `m` elements of `aa` are also present in `bb`. This calculation is performed by sliding a window of size `m` over `aa` and updating the counts of common elements between `aa` and `bb`. The function prints the number of times this condition is met for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no return value.
