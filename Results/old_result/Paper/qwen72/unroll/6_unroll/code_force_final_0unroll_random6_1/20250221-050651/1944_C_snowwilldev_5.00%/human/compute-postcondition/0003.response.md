Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then prints the first index `i` where the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a` or where `i` does not appear at all, and breaks out of the loop. If no such index is found, the function does not print anything for that test case. The function does not return any value. **
