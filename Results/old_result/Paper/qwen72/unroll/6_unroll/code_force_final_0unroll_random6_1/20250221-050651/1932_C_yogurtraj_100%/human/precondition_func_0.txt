The function should be called with the appropriate input as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the input should be provided through standard input or file input, containing multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string s of n characters, where each character is either 'L' or 'R'. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
