The function `func` reads an integer `test` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `a` and `b` are unchanged for each test case, and the variable `t` is incremented from 0 to `test - 1`.
