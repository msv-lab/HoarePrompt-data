Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it will print an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it will print the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it will print `-1`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` will retain their final values after the loop completes.**
