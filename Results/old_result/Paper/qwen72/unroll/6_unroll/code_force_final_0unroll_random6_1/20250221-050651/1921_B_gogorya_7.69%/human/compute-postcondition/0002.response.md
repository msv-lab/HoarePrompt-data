Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the variable `res` is printed, which represents the adjusted Hamming distance between the strings `s1` and `s2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` for each test case are unchanged, but the final value of `res` for each test case is determined and printed.**
