You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program: 
def func():

        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the given problem. It should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the number of children, the number of friend pairs, the number of excursions, and the list of friend pairs with their initial friendship values. The correct function definition should be:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The function will execute the loop for the specified number of test cases, and for each test case, it will calculate the value of `s` based on the inputs and print `s % M`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `a`, and `s` will be updated for each test case, but the overall state of the function will reset for each new test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in the excursions. The issue lies in the way the expected value is being computed in the loop:

```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

This loop incorrectly assumes that the friendship value of each pair increases linearly with each excursion. However, the correct approach should account for the probability of a pair being chosen and the cumulative effect of the friendship value increases over the excursions.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Initial Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the initial expected value of the friendship value being chosen in one excursion is \(\frac{f_i}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The total initial expected value for all pairs is \(\sum \frac{f_i}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

2. **Expected Value Increase:**
   - For each excursion, the probability of a pair being chosen is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - If a pair is chosen, its friendship value increases by 1, and this increase should be considered for subsequent excursions.

3. **Cumulative Expected Value:**
   - The expected value for each pair after \(k\) excursions can be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a geometric series.
   - The total expected value after \(k\) excursions is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

### Example Case:
For the input:
```
2 1 10
1 2 1
```
The program should output:
```
55
```
However, the current program's logic will not correctly compute this because it does not account for the cumulative effect of the friendship value increases over the excursions.

### Corrected Code:
A corrected version of the code might look like this:

```python
def func():
    mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, mod)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % mod
        expected_value = (a * c * k) % mod
        for _ in range(k):
            expected_value = (expected_value + c * m) % mod
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This corrected code correctly calculates the expected value by considering the initial friendship values and the cumulative effect of the friendship value increases over the excursions.
