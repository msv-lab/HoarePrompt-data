### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the threshold `m`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program splits the input into a list of strings `array`.
   - It initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the array.
   - It initializes `zeros` to store the number of trailing zeros in each integer.

3. **Counting Digits and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program iterates over each item in `array`, converting it to a string and adding its length to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends the result to `zeros`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments `counter` for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.

5. **Calculating Sasha's and Anna's Moves:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It calculates `subtract_zero` by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list. This is intended to simulate the effect of Anna's moves, where she can reverse the digits of a number, potentially reducing the number of digits that Sasha can concatenate.
   - The program then checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

6. **Determining the Winner:**
   - If the condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is true, Sasha wins because the final number will have at least `m + 1` digits.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `abs` Function:**
  - The use of `abs` in the condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is unnecessary. Since `subtract_zero` is always non-negative and `total_digits` is always positive, the expression `total_digits - subtract_zero` will always be non-negative. Therefore, `abs` can be removed.
  
- **Incorrect Logic for Trailing Zeros:**
  - The logic for counting trailing zeros and subtracting them from the total digits is flawed. Trailing zeros do not necessarily reduce the number of digits that can be concatenated. For example, reversing a number with trailing zeros (like 100) will not change the number of digits (100 becomes 001, which is 1).

- **Incorrect Calculation of `subtract_zero`:**
  - The program sums every second element in the `zeros` list, which is not a valid way to simulate Anna's moves. Anna's moves involve reversing the digits of a single number, not removing a specific number of digits.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem. The logic for counting trailing zeros and subtracting them from the total digits is incorrect, and the use of `abs` is unnecessary.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: False**
