Functionality: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. The function should accept the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `a` and `b`. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters, which is a discrepancy.**
