To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand what the function `func_1` does. However, since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, I'll assume a common function that could be used in such a context, such as the greatest common divisor (GCD) function. The GCD function is a common operation that could be applied in a loop like this, especially given the constraints on the values.

Assuming `func_1` is the GCD function, the loop will iteratively compute the GCD of `den` and each element `x` in the list `vals`.

### Initial State:
- `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.
- `vals` is a list of N integers read from the input, where each integer is between 2 and 20, inclusive.
- `den` is equal to the first integer in `vals`.

### Code of the Loop:
```python
for x in vals:
    den = func_1(den, x)
```

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in the list `vals`.
- For each `x`, `den` is updated to the GCD of `den` and `x`.

### Output State:
- After the loop finishes, `den` will be the GCD of all the integers in the list `vals`.
- The list `vals` remains unchanged.
- The value of `N` remains unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
- The variable `den` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals`.
- The list `vals` and the integer `N` will remain the same as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`den` is the GCD of all integers in `vals`, `vals` remains unchanged, `N` remains unchanged.**
