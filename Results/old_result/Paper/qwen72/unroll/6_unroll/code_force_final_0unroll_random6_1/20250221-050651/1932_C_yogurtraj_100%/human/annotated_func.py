#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with the appropriate input as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the input should be provided through standard input or file input, containing multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string s of n characters, where each character is either 'L' or 'R'. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        t = input()
        
        l = t.count('L')
        
        k = 0
        
        q1 = 0
        
        q2 = 0
        
        if t[-1] == 'L':
            k = a[l - 1] % m
            q1 = l - 2
            q2 = l
        else:
            k = a[l] % m
            q1 = l - 1
            q2 = l + 1
        
        y = [0] * n
        
        y[-1] = k
        
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if t[i] == 'R':
                k = k * a[q2] % m
                q2 += 1
            else:
                k = k * a[q1] % m
                q1 -= 1
            y[i] = k
        
        print(*y)
        
    #State: The loop will process each test case and print the resulting list `y` for each test case. The list `y` will contain the computed values based on the given logic for each element in the list `a` and the string `t`. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` will be in their final states as determined by the last test case processed. The specific values of these variables will depend on the input provided for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a string `s` of `n` characters ('L' or 'R'). For each test case, it computes a list `y` of `n` integers where each element is derived based on the input list `a`, the string `s`, and the integer `m` using a specific modular arithmetic operation. The final list `y` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` will be in their final states as determined by the last test case processed.
