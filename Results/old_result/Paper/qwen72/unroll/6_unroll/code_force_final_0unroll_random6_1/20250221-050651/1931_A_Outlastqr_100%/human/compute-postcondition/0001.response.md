The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since the function should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and the loop is intended to iterate over these test cases, the input should be `t`.

However, the function definition provided is `def func(t, test_cases):`, which means `t` is already defined and should be used directly in the loop. Therefore, the state should reflect that `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0**
