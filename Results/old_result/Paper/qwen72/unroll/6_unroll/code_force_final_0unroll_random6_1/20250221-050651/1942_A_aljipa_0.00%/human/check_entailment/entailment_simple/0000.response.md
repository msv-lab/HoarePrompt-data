### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Case Handling:**
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**
     - If `k` equals `n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones.
     - This is correct because an array of `n` ones will have exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts, as every cyclic shift of the array will be `[1, 1, ..., 1]`.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**
     - If `k` equals 1, the program outputs the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will not be sorted because they will have a larger number followed by a smaller number.
   - **Case 3: `k != 1` and `k != n`**
     - If `k` is neither 1 nor `n`, the program outputs `-1`.
     - This is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `1 < k < n`. There can be valid arrays for such cases, but the program simply outputs `-1` without attempting to find a solution.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case as required.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `1 < k < n` properly. It should attempt to find a valid array for such cases instead of always outputting `-1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
