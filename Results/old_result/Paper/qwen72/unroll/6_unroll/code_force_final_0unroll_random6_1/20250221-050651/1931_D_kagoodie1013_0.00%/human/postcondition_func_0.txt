The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a). It returns a list of results, where each result is the count of pairs (i, j) in the list a such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and either (a_i + a_j) % x = 0 or (a_i - a_j) % y = 0. The input `test_cases` list remains unchanged after the function execution.
