The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, and the condition for the loop to execute is `tickets_bought < k`. Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). Since `tickets_bought` is 0 and `k` is at least 1, the loop condition `tickets_bought < k` will be true, and the loop can execute the first time without any adjustments.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9). `prices` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `pq` is a heap (a priority queue) of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index. `total_cost` is 0. `tickets_bought` is 0. `price_increase` is 0.**
