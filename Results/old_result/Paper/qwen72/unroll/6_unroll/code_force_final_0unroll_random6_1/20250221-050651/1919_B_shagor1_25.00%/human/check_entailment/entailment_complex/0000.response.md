### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should accept parameters to handle the test cases properly. However, since the function reads input directly, it can still process the test cases, but this is not the best practice.

3. **Counting Negative Characters:**
   - The function correctly counts the number of "-" characters in the string `s` and stores this count in the variable `neg`.

4. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty calculation is based on the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. This formula is derived from the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the formula `n - 2 * neg` is correct because it calculates the difference between the number of "+" and "-" characters, and then multiplies by the length of the array to get the penalty.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string `s` consists entirely of "-" characters. In this case, the penalty is simply the length of the array `n` because each subarray will have a sum of `-1` and the penalty will be `1 * n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated penalty for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
- Despite the function not being defined with parameters, the program still processes the input correctly and calculates the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem.

**Correctness: True**
