Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it correctly prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters come in pairs (e.g., "AA" or "BB").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern "AAB" `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every "A" in "AAB" is a special character (since it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors).

4. **String Length Check**: The function then checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. However, the problem statement guarantees that if a solution exists, there will be a solution of length at most 200. Since the maximum value of `n` is 50, the maximum length of `s` is `50 // 2 * 3 = 75`, which is always less than 200. Therefore, the length check is unnecessary and can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

5. **Output Format**: The function correctly prints the output in the required format for both "NO" and "YES" cases.

Given the above points, the program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
