Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. The function should be defined with a parameter `n` to handle the input for each test case.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` from the user. This part is correct.

2. **Initialization of Lists**:
   - The `numbers` list is correctly initialized to store the `t` integers `n`.
   - The `values` and `sum_values` lists are initialized to store the sum of digits and cumulative sums, respectively. This is correct.

3. **Pre-computation for Single-Digit Numbers**:
   - The function correctly pre-computes the sum of digits for numbers from 0 to 9 and stores them in the `values` list.
   - It also correctly computes the cumulative sums for these numbers and stores them in the `sum_values` list.

4. **Computation for Multi-Digit Numbers**:
   - The function attempts to compute the sum of digits for numbers from 10 to `n` using a loop. However, there is a logical error in the way the sum of digits is calculated.
   - The line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `i` is a single-digit number (which it should not be in this loop, but it's still a potential issue).
   - The correct way to compute the sum of digits for a number `i` is to sum the digits directly, not by splitting the string and converting back to integers. This approach is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the `numbers` list.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function should be optimized to handle the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test. The current approach of converting each number to a string and then summing the digits is not efficient enough.

Given these points, the program is incorrect due to the logical error in the sum of digits calculation and the inefficiency of the current approach.

Correctness: **False**
