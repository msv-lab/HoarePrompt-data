The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It then counts the number of occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie" in the string `s`. After processing all test cases, it prints the count of these substrings for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
