Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The program then checks the conditions for a "STAIR" (`a < b < c`), a "PEAK" (`a < b` and `b > c`), and prints "NONE" if neither condition is met. The logic is straightforward and aligns with the problem requirements.

The execution summary confirms that the function processes the input as expected and prints the correct output for each test case. The program does not return any value or modify external state, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

Given that the program's behavior matches the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
