Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed. The formula used in the program does not align with the problem's requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a counterexample:
- For the input \(n = 3\) and \(m = 5\), the expected output is 4, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), and \((3, 3)\).
- However, the program outputs 6, which is incorrect.

The program's logic for calculating \(x\) and the subsequent conditions does not correctly identify the valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
