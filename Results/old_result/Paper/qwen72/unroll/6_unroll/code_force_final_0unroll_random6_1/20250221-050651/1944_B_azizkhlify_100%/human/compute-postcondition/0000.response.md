The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is derived from the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, which indicates the number of test cases. However, since the loop head uses `int(input())`, we need to ensure that this input is consistent with `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
