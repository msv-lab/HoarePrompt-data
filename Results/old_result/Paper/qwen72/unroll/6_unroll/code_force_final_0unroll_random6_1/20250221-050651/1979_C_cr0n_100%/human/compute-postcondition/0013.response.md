Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `vals` from the user. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in `vals` and stores it in `den`. It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. The function updates `den` to `den - sum(vprod)`. If the updated `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `den` is updated, `vals` remains unchanged, and `N` remains unchanged. **
