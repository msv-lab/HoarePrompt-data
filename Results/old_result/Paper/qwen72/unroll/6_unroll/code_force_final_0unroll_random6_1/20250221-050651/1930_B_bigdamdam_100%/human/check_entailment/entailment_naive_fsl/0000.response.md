Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program generates a permutation of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`. The approach used in the program is to alternate between the largest and smallest available numbers, which ensures that no two consecutive elements can both be divisors of two other consecutive elements. This strategy works for all valid inputs within the given constraints (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the program handles the input and output format correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
