### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves Alice and Bob playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move given the current state of the game.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice can only append elements to `c`, while Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
   - Alice starts first, and each player takes turns until `a` is empty.
   - Alice will try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest possible integers from `a` to minimize the MEX.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If an integer `i` appears only once in `a`, Alice will try to include it in `c` on her first opportunity, and Bob will try to remove it to prevent Alice from doing so.
   - If an integer `i` appears more than once, both players can ignore it in the initial stages since it will not affect the MEX until all smaller integers are considered.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `a` or appears only once in `a` and is the first such integer Alice can pick.
   - The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has encountered an integer that appears only once in `a`.

5. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Occurrences:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - If an integer `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and the MEX is `i`.
     - If an integer `i` appears only once in `arr` and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked such an integer, and the MEX is `i`.
     - If an integer `i` appears only once in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice will pick this integer on her next turn.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all integers in `a` are unique or where some integers appear more than once.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The program initializes `t`, `n`, and `a` as described in the problem.
  - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 Â· 10^5.

- **State After Function Call:**
  - The loop has completed all iterations for each test case.
  - The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
  - The variable `first` is either `True` or `False` depending on whether a unique integer was found in the list `arr`.
  - The variable `arr` is a list of `n` integers read from input, and `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of MEX Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` by checking `if i not in mpp.keys()`.
  - If `i` is not in `arr`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop, which is the correct MEX.
  - If `i` appears only once in `arr` and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop, which is the correct MEX because Alice has already picked such an integer.
  - If `i` appears only once in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice will pick this integer on her next turn.

- **Optimal Strategy Implementation:**
  - The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by considering the smallest integers and their occurrences.
  - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that appears only once, and Bob will try to remove it if possible.
  - The program ensures that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal moves of both players.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It finds the MEX of the array `c` that Alice constructs by considering the smallest integers and their occurrences in `a`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
