### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is a correct and efficient way to keep track of the frequency of each element.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the elements from 0 to `N-1` and checks the count of each element:
     - If an element `i` has a count of 1, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If `t` reaches 2 (indicating that two elements with a count of 1 have been found) or if an element `i` has a count of 0 (indicating that `i` is missing from the array), it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`.
   - If `cnt[i] == 0`, it means `i` is not in the array `a`, and thus it will not be in `c` either, making `i` the MEX.
   - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it means `i` appears exactly once in the array `a`. Alice can choose this element to maximize the MEX, but Bob can also choose it to minimize the MEX. The program correctly identifies that if two such elements are found, the MEX will be the next integer.
   - The program correctly breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds the MEX, which is the first integer `i` that is either missing or has a count of 1.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also handles the case where all elements are present and have a count of 1 or more.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, considering the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The logic and the implementation are sound and match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
