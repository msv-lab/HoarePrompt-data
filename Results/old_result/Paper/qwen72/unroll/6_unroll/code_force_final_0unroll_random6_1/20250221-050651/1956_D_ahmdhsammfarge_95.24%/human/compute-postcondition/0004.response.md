Output State: **lst is a list of integers, r and l are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), ops is a list that contains the operations [r + 1, l + 1] once or twice depending on the initial conditions, and now ops also contains the operation [r + 1, r + 1].** 

The code `ops.append([r + 1, r + 1])` adds the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. The initial state specifies that `ops` contains `[r + 1, l + 1]` once or twice based on the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`. After the code execution, `ops` will always contain `[r + 1, r + 1]` in addition to the previously mentioned operations. The values of `lst`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
