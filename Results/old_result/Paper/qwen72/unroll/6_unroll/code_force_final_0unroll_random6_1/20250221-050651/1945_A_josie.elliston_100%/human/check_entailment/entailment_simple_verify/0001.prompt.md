You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two other people.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be accommodated with the available universals.
   - If the remaining extroverts plus the universals are less than 3, it is impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people, so the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**
   - This function first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

4. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts need 1 tent with 1 universal.
     - Universals: 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + 1 universal) + 1 (2 universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 1 tent with 2 universals, but only 1 universal is available.
     - It is impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people for the remaining 2 extroverts.
     - Total: -1.
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 1 tent with 2 universals.
     - Universals: 0 universals left.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts + 2 universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert needs 2 more people, but only 1 universal is available.
     - It is impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people.
     - Total: -1.
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent.
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts need 1 tent.
     - Universals: 2 universals need 1 tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (2 universals) = 3 tents.
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Introverts: 19 tents.
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts need 3 tents with 2 universals each.
     - Universals: 18 - 6 = 12 universals left, which need 4 tents.
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 3 (extroverts + 2 universals each) + 4 (remaining universals) = 26 tents.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - No participants, so no tents are needed.
     - Total: 0 tents.
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - Introverts: 7 tents.
     - No extroverts or universals.
     - Total: 7 tents.
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - No introverts or universals.
     - Extroverts: 24 extroverts need 8 tents.
     - Total: 8 tents.
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - Introverts: 1000000000 tents.
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 extroverts need 333333334 tents with 2 universals each.
     - Universals: 1000000000 - 666666668 = 333333332 universals left, which need 111111111 tents.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 333333334 (extroverts + 2 universals each) + 111111111 (remaining universals) = 1666666667 tents.

### Correctness:
The provided program correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem. It ensures that introverts are given their own tents, extroverts are accommodated in tents with exactly two others, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots. The program also correctly returns `-1` when it is impossible to form the required tents.

Correctness: **True**
