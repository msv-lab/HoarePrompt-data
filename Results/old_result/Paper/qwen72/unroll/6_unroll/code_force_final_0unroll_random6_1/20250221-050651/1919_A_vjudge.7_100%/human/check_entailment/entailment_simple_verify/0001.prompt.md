You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, a, b):`
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `a` and `b` are unchanged for each test case. The output for each test case is 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The variable `t` has been incremented from 0 to `test - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is symmetric and the total number of coins (a + b) plays a crucial role.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a way where both players have an equal number of moves. Since Alice starts, Bob will always have the last move and win.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have one more move than Bob. Therefore, Alice can always ensure that she has the last move and win.

3. **Bitwise Operation:**
   - The program uses the bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1` to check if the total number of coins is odd or even.
   - `a + b & 1` is equivalent to checking if the least significant bit of `a + b` is 1 (odd) or 0 (even).
   - If `a + b & 1 == 0`, the total number of coins is even, and Bob wins.
   - If `a + b & 1 == 1`, the total number of coins is odd, and Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where both `a` and `b` are 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
   - The program also handles cases where the number of coins is large (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the bitwise operation is efficient and works within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy and the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
