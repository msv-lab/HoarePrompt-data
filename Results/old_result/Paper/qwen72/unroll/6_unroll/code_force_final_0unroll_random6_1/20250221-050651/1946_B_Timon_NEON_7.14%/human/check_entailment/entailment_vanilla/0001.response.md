### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and an integer `k`.
   - We need to perform exactly `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(number)`**:
   - This function returns the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This is a common operation to ensure that the result fits within the required constraints.
   - **Correctness**: This function is correct for the purpose of taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function 2: `func_2(arr)`**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
   - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` to keep track of the current segment and the maximum segment found so far.
   - It iterates through the array, updating `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
   - After the loop, it appends the final segments to `segments_variants`.
   - It then finds the segment with the maximum sum from `segments_variants`.
   - **Issues**:
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has a single element.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments with the same maximum sum.
   - **Correctness**: This function is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(number, quantity)`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not perform any meaningful operation.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not provide any logic to compute the final answer.
   - **Correctness**: This function is incorrect as it is incomplete and does not solve the problem.

5. **Overall Program**:
   - The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem.
   - The provided functions do not work together to achieve the desired result.
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to find the maximum possible sum after `k` operations, which is not addressed by the current functions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem requirements and lacks the necessary logic to compute the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
