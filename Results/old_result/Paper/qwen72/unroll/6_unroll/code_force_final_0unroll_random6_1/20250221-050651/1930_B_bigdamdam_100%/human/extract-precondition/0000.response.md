Precondition: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of all n values across test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
