Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - The program attempts to find the maximum subarray sum using a sliding window approach, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array contains both positive and negative numbers. The logic for resetting `c` when encountering a negative number is flawed and does not ensure that the maximum subarray sum is found.

2. **Incorrect Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is incorrect. The idea is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, but the formula used does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for inserting the sum of subarrays.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. **Find the Maximum Subarray Sum**:
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently. This algorithm works by maintaining a running sum and updating the maximum sum whenever the running sum exceeds the current maximum.

2. **Determine the Optimal Strategy**:
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, you can repeatedly insert this sum into the array to maximize the total sum. The number of times you can insert this sum is `k`, and the final sum of the array will be the original sum plus `k` times the maximum subarray sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the best strategy is to insert an empty subarray sum (which is 0) `k` times, as this will not change the sum of the array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        # Find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = -math.inf
        current_sum = 0
        for ele in l:
            current_sum = max(ele, current_sum + ele)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_sum)
        
        # Determine the final sum after k operations
        if max_subarray_sum > 0:
            final_sum = (total_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 1000000007
        else:
            final_sum = total_sum % 1000000007
        
        print(final_sum)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum and then applies the correct logic to determine the final sum of the array after `k` operations.
