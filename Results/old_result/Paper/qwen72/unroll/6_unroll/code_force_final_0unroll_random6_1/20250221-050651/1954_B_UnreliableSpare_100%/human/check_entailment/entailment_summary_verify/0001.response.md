### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are the same, the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that will be updated by any valid count.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element `val`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - After the loop, it ensures `ans` is updated with the count of the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` if the array is not all the same, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array has only one element correctly by outputting `-1` (since a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a single pass through the array to determine the minimum number of elements to remove, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler and more efficient approach using `float('inf')` or `math.inf`.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful by finding the smallest segment of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element.
   - However, the algorithm does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output `1` because it finds the smallest segment of consecutive `1`s. This is correct, but the reasoning is flawed because it only considers segments of the first element, not any other element.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `[2, 2, 2]`
  - All elements are the same, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Test Case 2**: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
  - The program correctly outputs `1` because removing the last element makes the array non-beautiful.
- **Test Case 3**: `[1]`
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because a single-element array is trivially beautiful.
- **Test Case 4**: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`
  - The program correctly outputs `3` because removing the first three elements makes the array non-beautiful.

### Flaw in the Algorithm:
- The program only considers segments of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This is incorrect because the array can be beautiful even if the first element is not the one that forms the longest segment of consecutive elements. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, the program will output `1` (considering the segment of `1`s), but the correct answer is `3` (considering the segment of `2`s).

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program's algorithm is flawed. It does not correctly handle all beautiful arrays by only considering segments of the first element.

Final: **False**
