Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly generate a permutation that meets the problem's requirements for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that there are no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

### Counterexample:
Consider the input \(n = 4\). The program generates the permutation \([4, 1, 2, 3]\).

- For \(i = 1\) and \(j = 3\):
  - \(p_1 = 4\) and \(p_3 = 2\). \(4\) does not divide \(2\).
  - \(p_2 = 1\) and \(p_4 = 3\). \(1\) divides \(3\).

However, the problem requires that there should be no such indices \(i\) and \(j\) where both conditions \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\) hold simultaneously. In this case, the permutation \([4, 1, 2, 3]\) does not satisfy the condition because \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 3\).

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach to generate such a permutation would involve ensuring that the permutation is constructed in a way that avoids the specified conditions. One possible correct solution is to alternate between the largest and smallest numbers, which can help avoid the division conditions.

For example:
```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(range(1, n + 1))
    result = []
    for i in range(n // 2):
        result.append(a[-(i + 1)])
        result.append(a[i])
    if n % 2 == 1:
        result.append(a[n // 2])
    print(result)
```

This approach ensures that the permutation is constructed in a way that avoids the division conditions by alternating between the largest and smallest numbers.
