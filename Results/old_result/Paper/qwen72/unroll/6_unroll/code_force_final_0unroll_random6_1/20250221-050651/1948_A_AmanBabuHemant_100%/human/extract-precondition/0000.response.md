Precondition: **The function should take an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept two parameters: `t` and a list of integers `n` for each test case. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) represents the number of special characters required in the string for each test case.**
