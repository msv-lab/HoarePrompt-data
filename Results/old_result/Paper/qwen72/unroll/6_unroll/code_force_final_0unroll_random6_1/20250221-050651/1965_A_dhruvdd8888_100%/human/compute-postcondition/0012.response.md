The given `print` statement is:

```python
print('Alice')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Alice'`. The initial state provides information about several variables and objects, but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'Alice'`.

Output: **Alice**
