Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` now assigned the value of an input integer, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. It is guaranteed that the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.**
