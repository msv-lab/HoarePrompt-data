Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `n` is provided as input. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9). It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined. The loop index `i` is equal to `n-1` after the loop completes. **
