### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a "beautiful" array, which means we can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index `i` with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}`.
   - We need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful.
   - If it's impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same (`flag = True`).
   - If they are, it prints `-1` because an array of identical elements will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

3. **Finding Minimum Elements to Remove:**
   - If the array is not all the same, the program then iterates through the array to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It keeps track of the count of consecutive elements (`cnt`) and updates the minimum count (`ans`) whenever it encounters a different element.
   - After the loop, it ensures the final count is considered by updating `ans` one last time.

4. **Output:**
   - If the array is all the same, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` for `ans` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simple integer `float('inf')` or a large number like `10**9`.
   - The variable `val` is set to `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the array. This is used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, but this does not necessarily ensure that the array will stop being beautiful.

6. **Correct Logic:**
   - To make the array not beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` such that `a_{i-1} == a_{i+1}` and `a_i` can be replaced by `a_{i-1}`.
   - The correct approach is to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that there is no valid `i` for the operation. This can be done by identifying the longest subarray where all elements are the same and removing elements to break this pattern.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It only considers the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, which does not guarantee that the array will stop being beautiful. The correct approach involves more complex logic to ensure that the array cannot be made all the same by the allowed operations.
