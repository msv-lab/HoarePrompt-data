The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `position`, but the condition for the loop to execute is solely dependent on `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is not equal to 0. According to the provided state, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, which means `n` is already guaranteed to be non-zero and within the specified range. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and `n` is not equal to 0; `position` is 0**
