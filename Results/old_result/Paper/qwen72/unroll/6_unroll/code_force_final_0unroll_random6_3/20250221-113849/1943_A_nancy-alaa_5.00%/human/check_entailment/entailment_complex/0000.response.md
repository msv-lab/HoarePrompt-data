### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - We need to determine the final score if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and is present in `a`.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is present in `a` and is not yet in `c`.
   - If both players play optimally, the final score will be the smallest integer that is not present in `a` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1` and checks:
     - If the integer `i` is not in `a`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the integer `i` is present exactly once and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If the integer `i` is present exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not present in `a` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered.
   - The `first` flag ensures that if there are multiple integers present exactly once, the first one is chosen.
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases and iterating through each one.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` (in which case the MEX would be `n`).
   - The program handles the case where `a` contains duplicates correctly by using the `Counter` and the `first` flag.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the final score of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
