### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros to handle 1-based indexing.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1, which is correct.

3. **Checking for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates over each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if the best friend of the best friend of `i` is `i` itself (`v[v[i]] == i`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and returns immediately. This is because if `i` and `v[i]` are mutual best friends, inviting both of them will ensure that both come to the party. This part of the program is correct.

4. **Default Case:**
   - If no mutual best friends are found, the program prints 3.
   - This assumption is not always correct. The program fails to consider cases where the minimum number of invitations required is less than 3. For example:
     - Consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, no mutual best friends are found, but inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party, which is the minimum number of invitations required.
     - Another example is `n = 5` and `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. Here, inviting friends 4 and 5 will ensure that both come to the party, which is the minimum number of invitations required.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Mutual Best Friends Check:**
  - The check `v[v[i]] == i` correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends.
  - If such a pair is found, the program correctly prints 2 and returns, as inviting both friends in the pair will ensure they both come to the party.

- **Default Case:**
  - The program assumes that if no mutual best friends are found, the minimum number of invitations required is 3.
  - This assumption is incorrect because it does not consider other configurations of best friends that might allow for fewer invitations. For example, in a cycle of 3 or more friends, inviting any 2 friends in the cycle will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where the minimum number of invitations required is less than 3 if there are other configurations of best friends that allow for fewer invitations.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
