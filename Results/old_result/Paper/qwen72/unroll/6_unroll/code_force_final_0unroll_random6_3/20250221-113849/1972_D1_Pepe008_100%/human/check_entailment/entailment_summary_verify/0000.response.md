### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which is intended to store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over `i` from 1 to `b + 1` and calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It adds `x` to `suma` if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\).
   - It also adds 1 to `suma` if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\).
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula and Logic**:
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\) is not necessary and does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The additional check \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) % i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) % i^2 == 0\) is also not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Subtracting 2 from the final sum (`suma - 2`) is not explained by the problem statement and is likely incorrect.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided corrected version of the program correctly implements this logic:
     ```python
     import math

     def func():
         T = int(input())
         for t in range(T):
             info = input().split()
             (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
             count = 0
             for a in range(1, n + 1):
                 for b in range(1, m + 1):
                     gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
                     if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                         count += 1
             print(count)

     func()
     ```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the provided corrected version of the program is the correct approach to solving the problem.

Final: **False**
