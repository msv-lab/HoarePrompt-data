You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of tuples (a, b) as input.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `T` times, and for each iteration, it will read a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it will print either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The variables `a` and `b` will be updated with the new input values for each iteration, and the loop will continue until all `T` iterations are completed. After the loop finishes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and `T` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of tuples (a, b), where each tuple contains two integers a and b such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. For each tuple, the function returns a result based on the values of a and b.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
