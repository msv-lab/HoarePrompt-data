Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the logic within the program does not correctly implement the solution for this problem.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the input.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1
     \]
   - It then checks if \(x\) is greater than 0 and adds it to `suma`.
   - Additionally, it checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) and adds 1 to `suma` if both conditions are met.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

3. **Issues with the Logic**:
   - The formula used to calculate \(x\) and the conditions checked do not align with the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program does not correctly implement this condition.
   - The logic of adding 1 to `suma` based on the additional conditions is not clear and does not seem to be derived from the problem statement.
   - The final subtraction of 2 from `suma` is also not justified by the problem statement.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), the correct condition to check is:
     \[
     (a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0
     \]
   - The program should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and count the pairs that satisfy this condition.

Given the issues with the logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
