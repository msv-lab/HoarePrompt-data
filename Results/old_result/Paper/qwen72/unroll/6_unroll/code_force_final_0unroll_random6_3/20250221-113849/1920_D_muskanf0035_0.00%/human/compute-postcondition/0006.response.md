Output State: `n` remains a positive integer, `operations` remains the same list of tuples, `queries` remains the same list of positive integers, `array` is a list containing elements based on the operations performed, and `result` is a list containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries` (where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`).
