Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic for splitting the array into two subsequences `a` and `b` is flawed, and it does not ensure that the penalty is minimized. The program attempts to append elements to `a` or `b` based on the comparison of the last elements of `a` and `b`, but this approach does not guarantee the optimal split.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider that the optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that no element in `s` is less than the next element in `s`, and no element in `t` is less than the next element in `t`. The correct approach involves counting the number of increasing pairs in the array and then determining the minimum penalty by considering the optimal split.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the number of increasing pairs in the array
        penalty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
                penalty += 1
        
        # The minimum penalty is the number of increasing pairs
        print(penalty)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of increasing pairs in the array, which is the optimal way to split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty.
