### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_2()`, which in turn calls `func_1()` to read a line from standard input and convert it to an integer.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which splits the input line and converts each part to an integer.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing a distance `r` and a direction `c` (which can be '0', '1', or '?').

2. **Set Initialization:**
   - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.

3. **Throw Processing:**
   - For each throw, the program checks if the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?'. If so, it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?'. If so, it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - The set `ans` is then updated to the contents of `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Zero:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set `ans`.
   - It then prints the sorted list of players in `ans`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Input Handling:**
  - The functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` correctly handle the input as described in the problem statement.
  
- **Correctness of Throw Processing:**
  - The logic for processing each throw is correct. It correctly accounts for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, as well as unknown directions.
  - The use of modulo `n` ensures that the player numbers wrap around correctly in a circular manner.

- **Correctness of Zero Adjustment:**
  - The adjustment for `0` to `n` is necessary and correctly implemented. This ensures that the player numbers are within the valid range `[1, n]`.

- **Correctness of Output:**
  - The output format matches the problem requirements. It prints the number of players who could have the ball and then the sorted list of those players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases and input constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
