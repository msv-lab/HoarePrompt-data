Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation in the provided program does not correctly solve this problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The line `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correctly derived from the problem statement. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but this line seems to be an attempt to count something related to \(a\) and \(i\), which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Adding to `suma`**:
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is not relevant to the problem. It checks if the result of a division plus one is positive, which is not the same as checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Final Adjustment**:
   - The line `print(suma - 2)` is subtracting 2 from the final result, which is not justified by the problem statement. The problem does not mention any need to subtract 2 from the count of valid pairs.

4. **Misinterpretation of \(b\) and \(\gcd(a, b)\)**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the calculation of \(\gcd(a, b)\) and the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It seems to be using \(i\) as a substitute for \(b\) and performing incorrect arithmetic operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
