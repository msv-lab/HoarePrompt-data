Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Removal of Elements**: The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` will always be 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the current state of the list. This means the program will always try to remove the first and third elements, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not appropriate. The loop should continue until all elements are processed, not just until the list has exactly two elements.

3. **Incorrect Indexing**: The program uses `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` to find the minimum of the first two elements. However, this approach does not ensure that the minimum value is always added to the score. The correct approach would be to sort the list and always take the smallest elements.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the list has duplicate elements, the program will not work correctly.

Here is a correct version of the program for reference:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

This version sorts the list and always adds the smallest `n` elements to the score, which ensures the maximum possible score is achieved. The original program fails to do this correctly, leading to incorrect results for many inputs. For example, with the input:

```
1
2
1 1 2 1
```

The original program will output `1` instead of `2`, which is incorrect.
