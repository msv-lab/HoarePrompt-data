Output State: **The values of `n` and `m` are updated for each iteration of the outer loop, and `ans` is calculated based on the updated values of `n` and `m`. After the outer loop completes all `t` iterations, the final values of `n` and `m` are the last inputs provided, and `ans` is printed for each iteration. The value of `t` remains unchanged.**
