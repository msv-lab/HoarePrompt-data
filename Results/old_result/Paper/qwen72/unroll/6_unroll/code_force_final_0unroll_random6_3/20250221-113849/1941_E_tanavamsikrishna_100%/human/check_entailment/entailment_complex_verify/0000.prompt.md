You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/6b5282a065196a0a0ca650a68a351af816de8549.png)
It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which is a non-negative integer updated based on the smallest element in the window of the first `d` elements of `row` that are still relevant.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 1. It modifies the list `row` by setting `row[0]` to 1, incrementing each element in the range 1 to d-1 by 2, and then updating each element from index `d` to the end of the list based on the smallest element in a sliding window of the first `d` elements. Finally, it returns the last element of `row`, which is a non-negative integer updated based on the smallest element in the relevant window of the first `d` elements.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values for n, m, k, and d where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. n, m, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The function also reads n rows of m integers each, forming a 2D list rows where each element rows[i][j] represents the depth a_{i,j} of the river cell, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0.

    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `total_costs` is a list of integers where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, starting from the first element up to the element that allows `k` consecutive elements to be summed. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, forming a 2D list `rows` where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth of the river cell. The function computes the cost for each row using the function `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`. It calculates the sum of `k` consecutive costs for all possible segments in `costs` and stores these sums in a list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the distance `d` is greater than or equal to the number of columns `m`. According to the problem description, the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`, and the distance between supports `(i, j1)` and `(i, j2)` is `|j1 - j2| - 1`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program should still be able to find a valid solution, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario and may fail to correctly calculate the minimum cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 5
0 1 2 3 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
In this case, `d` is 5, which is equal to `m`. The program should be able to place supports only at the river banks and still calculate the correct cost, but the current implementation may not handle this correctly.
