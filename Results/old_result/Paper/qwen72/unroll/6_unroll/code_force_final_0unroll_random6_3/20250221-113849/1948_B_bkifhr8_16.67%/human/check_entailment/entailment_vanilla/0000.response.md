### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array to check if any element is out of order (i.e., `list1[p - 1] > list1[p]`).
   - If an out-of-order element is found and it is greater than 10, the program splits it into its digits and inserts them back into the array in the correct positions.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially performing the operations, the program checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function compares the array `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst` and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
  - The program only splits the first out-of-order element it finds and then checks if the array is sorted. This is not sufficient because the operation can be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve the desired sorted order.
  - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it will not further split `45` to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` if needed.

- **Infinite Loop Potential:**
  - If the array is not sorted after the first split, the program will not re-evaluate the array to see if further splits are necessary. This could lead to incorrect results.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve the sorted order. For example, `[12, 28, 5]` should be split to `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` and then to `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Corrected Program:
To correctly handle the problem, we need to repeatedly apply the operation until no more elements need to be split or the array is sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while True:
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
                a.pop(i)
                a[i:i] = digits
                changed = True
                break
        if not changed:
            break
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation:
- **can_be_sorted Function:**
  - This function repeatedly checks the array for elements greater than or equal to 10 and splits them into their digits.
  - It uses a `while` loop to continue splitting until no more elements need to be split.
  - After all possible splits, it checks if the array is sorted.
- **Main Program:**
  - For each test case, it reads the array and calls the `can_be_sorted` function.
  - It prints 'Yes' if the array can be sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

This corrected program should handle all the cases correctly.
