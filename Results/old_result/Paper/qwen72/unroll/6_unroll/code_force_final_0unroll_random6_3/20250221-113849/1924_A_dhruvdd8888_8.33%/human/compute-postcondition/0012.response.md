Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
   - `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000.
   - `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`.
   - `ps` is the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered in `s`.
   - `ps` is less than `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'NO'`.
   - The values of `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - The condition that `ps` is less than `n` is given, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
