The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then prints the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified within the function.
