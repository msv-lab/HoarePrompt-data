Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input `n` is greater than the maximum value in the `numbers` list. The loop that calculates the `values` and `sum_values` arrays only runs up to `n + 1`, but `n` can vary for each test case. If `n` is greater than the maximum value in `numbers`, the program will not have precomputed the required values, leading to incorrect results for those test cases. For example, if the input is:
```
2
100
200
```
The program will only compute values up to `200`, but it will not handle the case where `n` is `200` correctly because it will not have computed the values for `100` and above. This is a potential edge case where the program fails to meet the problem description.
