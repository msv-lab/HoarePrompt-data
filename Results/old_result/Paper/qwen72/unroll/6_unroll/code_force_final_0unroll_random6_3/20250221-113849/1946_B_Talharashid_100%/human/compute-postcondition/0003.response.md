Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of `l` that does not include any negative number which would cause the sum to reset. The function then computes and prints the result of the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for each test case, where `maxi` is the maximum sum found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. **
