The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `s` is a string of length at most 10, consisting of lowercase English letters. The function processes each test case and returns the result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a string `s`. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is between 1 and 1000, and `s` is a string of at most 10 lowercase English letters. For each test case, the function returns the result based on the input `s`.**
