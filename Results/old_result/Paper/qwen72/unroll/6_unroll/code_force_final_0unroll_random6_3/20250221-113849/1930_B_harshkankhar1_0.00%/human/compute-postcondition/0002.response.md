The code snippet `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at the even indices of the list `a`. Let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial State**: `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where `n` is the input integer and 3 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5. `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Code Impact**:
   - `a[::2]` selects all elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).
   - `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
   - The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If `n` is 3, `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. The even indices are 0 and 2, so `a[::2]` is `[1, 3]`. Reversing this gives `[3, 1]`. Assigning this back to the even indices, `a` becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - If `n` is 4, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The even indices are 0 and 2, so `a[::2]` is `[1, 3]`. Reversing this gives `[3, 1]`. Assigning this back to the even indices, `a` becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`.
   - If `n` is 5, `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The even indices are 0, 2, and 4, so `a[::2]` is `[1, 3, 5]`. Reversing this gives `[5, 3, 1]`. Assigning this back to the even indices, `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
   - This pattern continues for any `n` within the given range.

4. **Output State**:
   - The elements at the even indices of `a` are reversed.
   - The elements at the odd indices of `a` remain unchanged.
   - `n` is still the length of the permutation `p`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where the elements at even indices are reversed, and the elements at odd indices remain unchanged. `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.**
