Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 <= s <= n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, `stack` is a list containing a single tuple `(s, False)`.** 

The code initializes a list named `stack` with a single tuple containing the starting vertex `s` and the boolean value `False`. The other variables `tree`, `s`, and `x` remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
