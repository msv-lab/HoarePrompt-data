You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma - 2)



- Annotated Code: 
import  math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, the function calculates the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        
        a, b = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        
        suma = 0
        
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0:
                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:
                    suma += 1
        
        print(suma - 2)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `T` times, and for each execution, it will read two integers `a` and `b` from the input, perform the specified calculations, and print the result. After all iterations, the variable `t` will be equal to `T - 1` (the last index of the range), and the variables `info`, `a`, `b`, and `suma` will retain their values from the last iteration. The initial value of `T` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs calculations to determine the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy a specific condition, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the variable `T` remains unchanged, while `a`, `b`, and `suma` retain their values from the last iteration, and the loop index `t` is equal to `T - 1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \(x\)**:
   - The program calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). This formula is not derived from the problem statement and does not correctly count the number of valid pairs.
   - The condition \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1 > 0\) is also not necessary and does not align with the problem requirements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum (`suma - 2`). This is not explained by the problem statement and is likely incorrect.

### Example Case:
For the input \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the expected output is 3, as the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\). However, the program does not produce this output correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The correct implementation would involve calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) and checking the condition for each pair.

Here is a corrected version of the program for reference:
```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.
