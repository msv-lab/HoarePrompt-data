### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is necessary to easily find pairs of identical elements.

4. **Finding Pairs in `lft`:**
   - The program iterates through `lft` to find pairs of identical elements and appends them to `ldb`.
   - It also keeps track of single elements that do not form pairs in `sng`.

5. **Finding Pairs in `rgt`:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates through `rgt` to find pairs of identical elements and appends them to `rdb`.

6. **Constructing the Output Arrays:**
   - The program constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing elements from `ldb` and `sng` to ensure the length of each array is `2k`.
   - It prints pairs of identical elements from `ldb` first, and if needed, single elements from `sng` to fill the required length.

7. **Ensuring Correct Length:**
   - The program uses a counter `sz` to keep track of the number of elements printed so far. It ensures that exactly `2k` elements are printed for both `l` and `r`.

8. **Bitwise XOR Check:**
   - The problem requires that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` be equal. The program does not explicitly check this condition, but it relies on the fact that pairs of identical elements have a bitwise XOR of 0, and the XOR of a single element with itself is also 0. This is a valid approach because the problem guarantees that a solution always exists.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling Single Elements:**
  - The program appends single elements to `sng` only if they are not followed by their pair in `lft`. This might lead to issues if the single elements are not correctly identified.
  - The program should ensure that single elements are correctly identified and used in the output arrays.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints elements directly without constructing the final arrays `l` and `r`. This is acceptable for the problem, but it might be more readable to construct the arrays and then print them.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the correct logic for finding pairs and single elements to construct the output arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that their bitwise XORs are equal. However, the handling of single elements in `sng` might need a more robust approach to ensure correctness in all cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a potential issue in how it handles single elements in `sng`. Specifically, the condition `elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` might not correctly identify all single elements, leading to incorrect output in some cases. Additionally, the program does not explicitly check the XOR condition, which, while not necessary due to the problem's guarantee, could be a point of concern for thoroughness.
