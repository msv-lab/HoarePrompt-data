### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = arr[0]` because `a_2` will be `arr[0] + a_1`.

4. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - It then checks if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`. If it is, it repeatedly adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = arr[-1]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **First Element:**
  - Setting `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` is correct because it ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = arr[0]`. For example, if `arr[0] = 2`, then `ans[0] = 3` and `a_2 = 5` (since `5 % 3 = 2`).

- **Subsequent Elements:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n - 2)` correctly iterates from the second element to the second-to-last element.
  - The assignment `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` is correct because it ensures that `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = arr[i + 1]` initially.
  - The while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]` ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary to satisfy the modulo condition. For example, if `arr[i] = 4` and `ans[i] = 5`, then `ans[i + 1] = 9` (since `9 % 5 = 4`).

- **Last Element:**
  - The assignment `ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]` is correct because it ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = arr[-1]`. For example, if `arr[-1] = 1` and `ans[-2] = 4`, then `ans[-1] = 5` (since `5 % 4 = 1`).

### Edge Cases:

- **Single Element Test Case:**
  - The program handles the minimum number of elements correctly (i.e., `n = 2`).
  - For `n = 2`, `arr` will have only one element, and the program will correctly set `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` and `ans[1] = ans[0] + arr[0]`.

- **Large Values:**
  - The program ensures that all values in `ans` are within the range `[1, 10^9]` as required by the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and satisfies the given problem description. The logic ensures that for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `ans[i] % ans[i-1] = arr[i-1]`. The while loop in the function `func_1` ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary to satisfy the modulo condition.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
