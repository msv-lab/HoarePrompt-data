### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: A list `row` representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and an integer `d` representing the maximum distance between supports.
   - **Behavior**:
     - The function modifies the first element of `row` to 1.
     - It increments each element in the range 1 to `d-1` by 2.
     - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the smallest elements in a sliding window of size `d`.
     - For each element from index `d` to the end of the list, it updates the element based on the smallest element in the heap plus the current element plus 1.
     - Finally, it returns the last element of `row`, which represents the total cost of installing supports for that row.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly handles the conditions that supports must be installed at the first and last columns.
     - It ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d` by using a sliding window approach with a min-heap.
     - The cost calculation is correct, as it adds `a_{i,j} + 1` for each support and ensures the minimum cost by using the heap.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: The number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the values `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - **Behavior**:
     - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
     - It reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, forming a 2D list `rows`.
     - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`.
     - It calculates the sum of `k` consecutive costs for all possible segments in `costs` and stores these sums in a list `total_costs`.
     - It prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.
   - **Correctness**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It uses `func_1` to compute the cost for each row, which is correct as per the reasoning above.
     - It calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost, which is the required output for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because both functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem as described. `func_1` correctly computes the cost for a single row, and `func_2` correctly aggregates the costs for `k` consecutive rows to find the minimum total cost.

### Correctness:
**True**
