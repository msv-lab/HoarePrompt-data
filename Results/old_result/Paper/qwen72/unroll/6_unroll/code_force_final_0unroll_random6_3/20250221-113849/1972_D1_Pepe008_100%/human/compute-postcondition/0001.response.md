The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the input integer `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be a positive integer, and `t` must be initialized to 0, as it is the starting point of the `range(T)`.

Given that `T` is an input integer and is already constrained to be within the range 1 <= `T` <= 10^4, we do not need to adjust `T` itself. However, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly initialized to 0, and `T` is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`T` is an input integer where 1 <= `T` <= 10^4, `t` is 0**
