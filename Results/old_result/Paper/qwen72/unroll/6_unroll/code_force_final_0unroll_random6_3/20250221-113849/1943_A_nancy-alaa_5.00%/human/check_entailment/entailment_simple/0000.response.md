### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `[0, n)` to find the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer `i` that is not in `c` and is present in `a` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest integer `i` that is present in `a` but not in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` is present exactly once in `a`, Alice will pick it on her first turn to ensure it is in `c` and to maximize the MEX.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that is not present in `arr` or is present exactly once and is the first such integer encountered.
   - This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, as Alice will pick the smallest integer that is not in `c` and Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `arr` contains all integers from `0` to `n-1` by printing `n` as the MEX.
   - It also handles the case where `arr` contains duplicates of the same integer by correctly identifying the first integer that is not present or is present exactly once.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct MEX for each test case, which is the expected output based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` constructed by Alice and Bob playing optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
