Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are specific integers provided by the input, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth `a_{i,j}` of the river cell, and `rows[i][1]` and `rows[i][m]` are 0 for all `i` in the range [0, n-1]. `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to each row of `rows` with the argument `d`. `total_costs` is an empty list.**
