### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove elements that would otherwise be included by Alice, especially those that are unique and small.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is either not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.

4. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It initializes a variable `first` to `False` to track if Alice has picked a unique element.
     - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`:
       - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`, which is the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means Alice has already picked a unique element, and Bob will pick the next unique element, making `i` the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`. This means Alice will pick this unique element on her next turn.

5. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.
   - However, the program does not explicitly model the turns of Alice and Bob. It assumes that Alice will always pick the first unique element and Bob will pick the next unique element, which is not always the optimal strategy.

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not simulate the actual turns of Alice and Bob. It only checks the presence and count of elements in `arr`.
   - The logic for setting `first` to `True` and breaking the loop when `first` is `True` and `mpp[i] == 1` is flawed. It does not consider the optimal play where Bob might remove a unique element that Alice would have picked.

7. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program's logic for finding the MEX is not robust enough to handle all cases where both players play optimally.
   - For example, in the case where `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, the program will output `2` because it finds the first unique element `1` and sets `first` to `True`. However, the optimal play would result in `c = [0, 1]` and the MEX would be `2`, which is correct in this specific case but not guaranteed to be correct in all cases.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It fails to simulate the actual turns and the strategic decisions each player would make. Therefore, the program is not correct in all scenarios.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
