Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates `T` times, reading a pair of integers `a` and `b` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - **a == b**: If both players have the same number of coins, the game will always end in a draw, but since the rules state that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, and both players will be in the same state, Bob will win. This is correctly handled.
   - **a == 1**: If Alice has only 1 coin, she will lose on her first turn because she cannot remove a coin without making her wallet empty. This is correctly handled.
   - **b == 1**: If Bob has only 1 coin, Alice can always win by swapping wallets on her first turn, leaving Bob with an empty wallet. This is correctly handled.

3. **Even and Odd Cases**:
   - **a % 2 == 1**: If Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob can always win by playing optimally. This is because Bob can force Alice into a position where she will eventually have to make her wallet empty. This is correctly handled.
   - **a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1**: If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always win by playing optimally. This is because Alice can force Bob into a position where he will eventually have to make his wallet empty. This is correctly handled.

4. **Comparison Cases**:
   - **a > b**: This condition is incorrect. If Alice has more coins than Bob, it does not necessarily mean Bob will win. The correct logic should consider the parity of the coins and the optimal strategy.
   - **else**: This condition is also incorrect. It does not correctly handle all possible scenarios where Alice has fewer coins than Bob.

5. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves considering the parity of the coins. If both players have an even number of coins, the game will always end in a draw, but since the rules state that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, Bob will win. If both players have an odd number of coins, Bob will win because he can force Alice into a losing position. If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice will win. If Alice has an odd number of coins and Bob has an even number of coins, Bob will win.

Given the above reasoning, the conditions for `a > b` and `else` are incorrect and need to be revised to correctly determine the winner based on the optimal strategy.

Correctness: **False**

The function should be revised to correctly handle the comparison cases based on the parity of the coins. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
```

This revised function correctly handles all the cases based on the optimal strategy.
