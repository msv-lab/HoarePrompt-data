### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's logic. The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same, but this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Let's break down the issues and the correct logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program uses a flag `flag` to check if all elements in the array are the same. If any element is different from its previous element, `flag` is set to `False`.
   - This part of the program is correct. If all elements are the same, the array is beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the output should be `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and `val` to the first element of `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `val` and updating `ans` with the minimum count of such consecutive elements.
   - This logic is flawed because it only considers the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. It does not consider the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that are not part of these consecutive sequences.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 2 1 2 1
     ```
     The program outputs `1`, which is correct. By removing the element at index 4 (0-based index), the array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     6
     1 2 1 2 1 2
     ```
     The program outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `1`. By removing the element at index 5 (0-based index), the array becomes `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful.

### Correct Logic:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make the array beautiful. This involves checking for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect, as it only considers consecutive elements that are the same as the first element and does not handle the general case of breaking the beauty of the array.

**Final: False**
