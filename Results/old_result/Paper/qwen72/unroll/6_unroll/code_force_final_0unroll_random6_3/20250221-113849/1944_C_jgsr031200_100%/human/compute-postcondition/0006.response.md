The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies \( 0 \le a_i < n \), and \( n \) is the length of the list \( arr \). The function returns a value based on the input list `arr`.

Since the output description is not provided, I will infer the most common functionality that fits the given constraints. One common functionality for such a function is to determine if the list contains any duplicate values, as this is a typical problem when dealing with lists of integers within a specific range.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` where each integer is between 0 and the length of the list minus one, inclusive. It returns `True` if the list contains any duplicate integers, and `False` otherwise.**
