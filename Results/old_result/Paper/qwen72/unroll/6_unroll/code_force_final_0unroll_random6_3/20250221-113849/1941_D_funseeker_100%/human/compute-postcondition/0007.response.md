Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`. If 0 is in `ans`, the set `ans` no longer contains the value 0, and now includes the value `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
