Output State: **The loop iterates t times, where t is the number of test cases. For each test case, the output is the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (s1) to the desired state (s2). The operations involve flipping a '1' to a '0' or a '0' to a '1'. The variable `res` holds this minimum number of operations for each test case, and it is printed after each iteration. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.**
