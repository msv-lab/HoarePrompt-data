Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `t` is now 0, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `a` are in their final state after the last test case, but their specific values are not predictable without the actual input. The variables `tmp`, `cnt`, and `ans` are also in their final state after the last test case, but their specific values are not predictable without the actual input.**
