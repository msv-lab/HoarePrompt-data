#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def find_subarrays(a, n, k):` where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list `a` contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        lft = lst[:n]
        
        rgt = lst[n:]
        
        ldb = []
        
        rdb = []
        
        sng = []
        
        lft.sort()
        
        rgt.sort()
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
                ldb.append(lft[i])
            elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
                sng.append(lft[i])
        
        for i in range(1, n):

        for elem in ldb:
            if sz >= k:
                break
            if k - sz >= 2:
                print(elem, elem, end=' ')

    #State: The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and a list of integers `lst` of length `2n`. It then processes the list to find and print pairs of integers from the left and right halves of the sorted list, ensuring that the total number of printed integers is `k`. After each iteration, the variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `T`, which is the total number of iterations the loop will execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by a list of integers `lst` of length `2n`. It then processes the list to find and print pairs of integers from the left and right halves of the sorted list, ensuring that the total number of printed integers is `k` for each half. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After each test case, the variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `T`, which is the total number of test cases.
