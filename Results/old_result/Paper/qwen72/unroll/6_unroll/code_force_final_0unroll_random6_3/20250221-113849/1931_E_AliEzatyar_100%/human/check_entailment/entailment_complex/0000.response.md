**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of each string representation of the integers.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros to be subtracted by summing every second element in the sorted `zeros` list. This is based on the idea that Anna can reverse the digits of the integers, and Sasha can concatenate them, potentially reducing the number of trailing zeros.
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer (represented as a string).
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros, and the input string remains unchanged.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case in the `answers` list.

**Issues:**
- **Trailing Zeros Calculation:** The function `func_1` is designed to count trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer, which is correct. However, the program incorrectly assumes that the number of trailing zeros in the list `array` can be used to determine the outcome of the game. The game rules focus on the digit reversal and concatenation, not just the trailing zeros.
- **Total Digits Calculation:** The program calculates the total number of digits correctly, but it does not consider the effect of digit reversal on the game outcome.
- **Winning Condition:** The winning condition is based on the total number of digits and trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the winner. The game involves strategic moves by both players, and the program does not simulate these moves.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem. It only considers the total number of digits and trailing zeros, which is not enough to determine the winner based on the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
