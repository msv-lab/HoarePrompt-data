### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing the operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements of the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Functions:**

   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function aims to find the subarray that, when replaced with its MEX, will maximize the sum of the array.
     - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced with its MEX.
     - However, the MEX calculation is incorrect. The function uses \((j - i + 1)^2\) as a proxy for the MEX, which is not the correct way to compute MEX. The correct MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
     - Therefore, the indices returned by `func_1` are likely incorrect and do not maximize the sum of the array.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function recursively appends operations to the `ops` list.
     - It is designed to handle the case where the subarray is being replaced with its MEX value.
     - The function is not directly related to the MEX calculation but is used to generate the sequence of operations.
     - The function does not ensure that the operations are optimal or that they achieve the maximum sum.

   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
     - This function performs the operation on the subarray and updates the `ops` list.
     - It appends the operation to the `ops` list and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If so, it appends the operation again.
     - The MEX value is incorrectly set to the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX.
     - The function updates the array and returns it.
     - The function also appends operations multiple times, which is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - **MEX Calculation:**
     - The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. It should find the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1)^2\).
   - **Function 3:**
     - The MEX value is incorrectly set to the length of the subarray, which is not the correct MEX.
     - The function appends operations multiple times, which is not necessary and could lead to an incorrect sequence of operations.
   - **Overall Logic:**
     - The program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described. The incorrect MEX calculation and the unnecessary operations in `func_3` will not achieve the maximum sum of the array.

### Conclusion:
- The provided program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray.
- The operations generated by the program may not achieve the maximum sum of the array.
- The program does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
