Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the parameters of an operation, and the last element of `ops` is `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` has been appended to `ops`.** 

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. The values of `lst`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged. The condition about the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` being 0 is not affected by this operation. The last element of `ops` is now `[r + 1, r + 1]`.
