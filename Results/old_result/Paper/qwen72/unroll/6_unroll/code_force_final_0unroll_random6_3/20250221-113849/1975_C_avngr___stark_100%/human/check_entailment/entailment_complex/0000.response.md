### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If `n` is 2, the function prints the minimum value of the two elements in the array `a`. This is correct because, in an array of length 2, the only possible median is the smaller of the two elements, and the array will be changed to contain this minimum value.

3. **General Case for `n > 2`:**
   - The function initializes `max` to 0.
   - It then iterates over every possible consecutive triplet in the array `a` (from index 0 to `n-3`).
   - For each triplet, it sorts the triplet and checks the second element (which is the median of the triplet).
   - If this median is greater than the current `max`, it updates `max`.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum median value found.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum possible value that the array can be changed to by repeatedly applying the operation.
   - The median of a triplet is the middle value after sorting, and by iterating over all possible triplets, the function ensures that it considers all potential medians.
   - The maximum of these medians is the highest value that can be uniformly applied to the entire array, as per the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly.
   - For larger arrays, the function ensures that it considers all possible triplets, which is necessary to find the maximum median.
