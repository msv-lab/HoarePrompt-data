The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 0, because `range(n + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop.

The state of `freq` and `cou` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to be meaningful in the context of the given state, `freq` should be a list of length `n + 1` and `cou` should remain 0.

State: **`freq` is a list of length `n + 1`, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
