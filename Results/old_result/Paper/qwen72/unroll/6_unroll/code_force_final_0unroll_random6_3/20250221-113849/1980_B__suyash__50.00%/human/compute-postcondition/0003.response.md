The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `f` is an integer representing the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1 ≤ f ≤ n), `k` is an integer representing the number of cubes to be removed (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `a` is a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).

The function returns the number of ways to remove `k` cubes such that Dmitry's favorite cube is not removed.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`, and returns the number of ways to remove `k` cubes from the list `a` such that the cube at index `f` is not removed.**
