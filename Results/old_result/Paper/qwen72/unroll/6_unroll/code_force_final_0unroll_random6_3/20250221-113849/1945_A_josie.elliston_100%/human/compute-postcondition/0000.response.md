Output State: **introverts is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= introverts <= 10^9, extroverts is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= extroverts <= 10^9, universals is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= universals <= 10^9, ret is the result of func_1(extroverts, universals)**. 

The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged. The variable `ret` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The specific value of `ret` depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
