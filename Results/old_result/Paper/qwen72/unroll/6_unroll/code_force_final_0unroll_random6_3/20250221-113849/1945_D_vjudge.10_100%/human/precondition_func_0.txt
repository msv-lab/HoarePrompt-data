pergunta is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), a and b are lists of integers of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), where each element a_i and b_i satisfies (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), and n and m are integers such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
