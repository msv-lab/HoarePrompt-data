The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with `n` ranging from 1 to 2 路 10^5 and `k` ranging from 1 to 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 路 10^5. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k` for each test case, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 路 10^5, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 路 10^5. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**
