Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the distance `d` is greater than or equal to the number of columns `m`. According to the problem description, the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`, and the distance between supports `(i, j1)` and `(i, j2)` is `|j1 - j2| - 1`. If `d` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program should still be able to find a valid solution, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario and may fail to correctly calculate the minimum cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 5
0 1 2 3 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 3 2 1 0
```
In this case, `d` is 5, which is equal to `m`. The program should be able to place supports only at the river banks and still calculate the correct cost, but the current implementation may not handle this correctly.
