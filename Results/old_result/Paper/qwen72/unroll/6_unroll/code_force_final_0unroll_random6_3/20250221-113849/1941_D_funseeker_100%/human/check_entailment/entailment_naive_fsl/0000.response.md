Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the player number is 1 and a throw is made counterclockwise with a distance equal to the number of players (n). In such a case, the player number should wrap around to n, but the current implementation incorrectly wraps it to 0, which is then discarded and replaced with n. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 1 1
5 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
1
5
```
However, the program will output:
```
1
1
```
This is because the calculation `(q - r) % n` for `q = 1` and `r = 5` results in `0`, which is then incorrectly handled.
