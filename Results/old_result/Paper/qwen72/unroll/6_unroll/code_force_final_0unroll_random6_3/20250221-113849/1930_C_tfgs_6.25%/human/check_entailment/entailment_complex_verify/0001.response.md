### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program correctly simulates the operation of adding `a[i] + i + 1` to the set `S` by modifying each element in place: `a[i] += i + 1`.
   - This ensures that the elements inserted into the set `S` are unique and correctly calculated.

3. **Set and Counter**:
   - The modified array `a` is converted to a set to ensure all elements are unique.
   - A `Counter` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the modified array, which is appropriate for this problem.
   - The set conversion and sorting are done correctly.

4. **Sorting and Lexicographical Construction**:
   - The unique elements are sorted in descending order to form the array `b`.
   - The program then constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by:
     - Iterating over the sorted unique elements.
     - For each element, it tries to add as many elements as possible that are just below the current element but not already in the set.
     - This is done using the `adv` variable, which calculates the number of such elements that can be added.
     - The elements are added to the `ans` list and the `Counter` is updated accordingly.
   - The `adv` variable is calculated as `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])`, which ensures that:
     - The number of elements added is limited by the gap between consecutive elements in the sorted list.
     - The number of elements added does not exceed the remaining count `cnt`.
     - The number of elements added does not exceed the frequency of the previous element in the `Counter`.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (tracked by `cnt`), the program adds the remaining elements in decreasing order starting from the last element in `ans`.
   - This ensures that the final length of `ans` is `n`.

6. **Output**:
   - The constructed array `b` is printed for each test case.

### Validation with Annotated Code:
- **State After Modification**:
  - The list `a` is modified such that each element `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.
- **State After Set Conversion and Sorting**:
  - The list `a` is converted to a set and then sorted in descending order. This ensures that all elements are unique and in the correct order.
- **State During Lexicographical Construction**:
  - The `adv` variable is used to add elements just below the current element, which is a logical approach to ensure the lexicographical order.
  - The `Counter` is updated to reflect the elements added to `ans`.
- **State After Final Adjustments**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are still elements left to be added by appending consecutive integers in decreasing order.

### Example Validation:
- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `2 2 1`
  - After modification: `a = [3, 2]`
  - Set and sort: `a = [3, 2]`
  - Final output: `3 2`
  - This is correct and lexicographically largest.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `5 1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
  - After modification: `a = [2, 102, 1003, 1000004, 1000000005]`
  - Set and sort: `a = [1000000005, 1000004, 1003, 102, 2]`
  - Final output: `1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2`
  - This is correct and lexicographically largest.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `3 6 4 8`
  - After modification: `a = [7, 6, 11]`
  - Set and sort: `a = [11, 7, 6]`
  - Final output: `11 7 6`
  - This is correct and lexicographically largest.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b`. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
