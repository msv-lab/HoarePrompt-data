The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. `arr` is a list of integers where each element `arr[i]` satisfies the constraint 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < n. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. The function returns a list `ans` where:
- The first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
- Each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for 1 <= i < n-1) is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `arr[i-1]`.
- The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, each subsequent element is the smallest value greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `arr` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding the previous element in `ans` to the previous element in `arr`, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element in `ans` and the last element in `arr`.**
