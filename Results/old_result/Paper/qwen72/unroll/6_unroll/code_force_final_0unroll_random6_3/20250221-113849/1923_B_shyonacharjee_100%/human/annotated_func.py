#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple containing three lists: the first list has two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), the second list has n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and the third list has n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n, x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: The loop will iterate `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n` and `k` from the input, then read two lists `a` and `x` from the input. After processing, it will print 'YES' if the player can survive the attack of all monsters, or 'NO' if the player cannot survive. The variables `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` will be reset or updated for each test case, but the overall structure of `test_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `a` and `x` of length `n` from the input. It then determines whether a player can survive an attack from `n` monsters, each with a position `x_i` and health `a_i`. The player can survive if the total number of bullets used to defeat all monsters (where each monster requires `a_i` bullets) does not exceed the maximum distance `k` multiplied by the absolute position of the monster. The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive the attack for the current test case, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
