You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    5
    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then calculates `x - 1` and prints this value. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `t` and `x` are no longer relevant, and the program has printed `t` lines, each containing the value of `x - 1` for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( x \) is a prime number correctly. For a prime number \( x \), the greatest \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized should be \( y = x - 1 \), because \( \gcd(x, x-1) = 1 \) and \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \). However, for non-prime numbers, the program always outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which is not necessarily the correct answer.

For example, consider \( x = 10 \). The program outputs \( y = 9 \). However, \( \gcd(10, 9) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 10 \). But if we choose \( y = 5 \), then \( \gcd(10, 5) = 5 \), and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \). Both \( y = 9 \) and \( y = 5 \) yield the same maximum value, but the problem description allows for any \( y \) that satisfies the condition. In this case, the program's output is correct, but it does not guarantee the correct output for all cases.

A more critical example is \( x = 21 \). The program outputs \( y = 20 \). However, \( \gcd(21, 20) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(21, 20) + 20 = 21 \). But if we choose \( y = 14 \), then \( \gcd(21, 14) = 7 \), and \( \gcd(21, 14) + 14 = 21 \). Both \( y = 20 \) and \( y = 14 \) yield the same maximum value, but the program does not consider other potential values of \( y \) that might also satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases.
