You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`, `ps` is the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.

    #State: The loop prints a string for each character in the set `us` that is not in `win`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` concatenated with the current character from `us` and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` from the input. It processes the string `s` to find sequences of characters that form a complete set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the function finds at least `n` such complete sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After printing 'NO', the function prints a string for each character in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that was not part of any complete set found in `s`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` (the last character of each complete set found), concatenated with the current character from the set, and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The function returns `None` in all cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, it does not check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. Instead, it only checks if a sliding window of characters in `s` can form a set of `k` unique characters, and if it can, it adds the character to `ans` and clears the window. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible combinations of strings of length `n`.

### Example of Incorrect Behavior:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 2 4
abba
```
The correct output should be:
```
YES
```
However, the program will output:
```
NO
aa
```
This is incorrect because all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (i.e., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of "abba".

### Why the Program Fails:
1. **Subsequence Check**: The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. It only checks if a window of characters can form a set of `k` unique characters, which is not the same as checking all possible strings of length `n`.
2. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program generates a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a character not in `win`. This approach is not guaranteed to generate a valid missing subsequence, especially when the string `s` is short or does not contain all possible subsequences.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the missing string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

The provided program does not perform these steps, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
