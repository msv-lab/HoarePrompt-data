Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading an integer `n` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to create a string with an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., "AA", "BB").

3. **String Construction**: If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This ensures that the string will have exactly `n` special characters. For example, if `n = 6`, the string will be 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAABAAB', which has 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8).

4. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. This is necessary because the problem specifies that the string should have a length of at most 200.

5. **Output Format**: The program follows the specified output format for each test case. It prints 'NO' if no suitable string can be constructed, and 'YES' followed by the string if a suitable string is found.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n = 1`, it correctly prints 'NO' because 1 is an odd number and cannot be split into pairs of special characters.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
