The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `_` is a placeholder variable**
