You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list. The list `num` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Zero Trailing Count**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over each item in the array, adding the length of the item (number of digits) to `total_digits`.
   - It uses `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends this count to the `zeros` list.

3. **Trailing Zeros Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly counts the trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - The `zeros` list is then sorted in descending order.

4. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program initializes `subtract_zero` to 0.
   - It iterates over the `zeros` list in steps of 2, adding the value of each element to `subtract_zero`. This is intended to simulate the effect of Anna's moves, where she can reverse the digits of a number, potentially reducing the total number of digits in the list.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to "Sasha", otherwise it sets the answer to "Anna".

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Total Digits Calculation**:
  - The total number of digits in the list is correctly calculated by summing the lengths of the string representations of the numbers.

- **Trailing Zeros**:
  - The trailing zeros are correctly counted and stored in the `zeros` list.
  - Sorting the `zeros` list in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the effect of Anna's moves.

- **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
  - The program subtracts the trailing zeros in pairs, which is a reasonable approach to simulate Anna's optimal play.
  - However, the logic of subtracting trailing zeros in pairs might not fully capture the optimal strategy for Anna. Specifically, Anna can reverse any number, and the effect of reversing a number with trailing zeros is not just removing those zeros but also changing the order of the digits.

- **Winning Condition**:
  - The condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is intended to check if the remaining digits after Anna's optimal play can form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
  - This condition might be too simplistic. For example, if the total number of digits is just slightly more than `m`, and all the trailing zeros are removed, the remaining number might still be less than \(10^m\).

### Conclusion:

The program's logic for counting trailing zeros and subtracting them in pairs is a good start, but it may not fully capture the optimal strategy for Anna. The winning condition might be too simplistic and could lead to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not fully account for the optimal play of both players, especially in how Anna's moves can affect the final number. A more detailed analysis of the game's rules and the optimal strategies for both players is needed to ensure the program's correctness.
