The function `func_1` seems to be missing the parameters in its definition. Based on the provided parameter constraints, it should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `piles`. Here's the description of the function's parameters and expected return value:

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles.
- `piles` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) where each `a_i` represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function should return a result based on these inputs. However, the specific output or return value is not provided in the question. Assuming the function is designed to process the piles of stones in some way (e.g., determining the number of stones left after a certain operation), we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (the number of piles), and `piles` (a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile). It processes the piles of stones according to some rules and returns a result based on the input parameters.**
