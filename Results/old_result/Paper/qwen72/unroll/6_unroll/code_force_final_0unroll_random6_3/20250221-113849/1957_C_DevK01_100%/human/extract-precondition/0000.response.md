Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take more parameters to account for the number of moves `k` and the specific moves made. Here is a corrected function definition and precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_final_configurations(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains n, k, and a list of k moves. For each test case, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the size of the chessboard, k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ n) representing the number of moves already played, and the list of moves contains k tuples (r_i, c_i) of integers (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the positions of the rooks placed. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**
