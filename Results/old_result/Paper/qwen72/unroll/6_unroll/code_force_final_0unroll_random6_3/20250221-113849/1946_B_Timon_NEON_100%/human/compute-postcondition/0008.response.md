Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments, and now includes an additional segment which is `max_segment` with the end index `len(arr) - 1` appended to it, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`**

The code snippet `total_max_segment = [-1]` initializes the variable `total_max_segment` to a list containing a single element `-1`. The other variables (`new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
