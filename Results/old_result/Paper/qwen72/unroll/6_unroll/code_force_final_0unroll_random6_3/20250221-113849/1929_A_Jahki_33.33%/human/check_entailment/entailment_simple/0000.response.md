### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`num2`) and the array elements, converting them to a list of integers (`a`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already in non-decreasing order.
   - It does this by iterating through the array and counting the number of times an element is not greater than the next element (`order`).
   - If `order` is 0, it means the array is already in non-decreasing order, and the function returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Beauty Calculation**:
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints 0, which is correct because the beauty of a non-decreasing array is 0.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem. The beauty of an array is maximized by sorting it in non-decreasing order, regardless of whether it was already sorted or not.
  - The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, but the problem requires maximizing the beauty, which is always achieved by sorting the array.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach is to always sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because it uses an unnecessary and incorrect function `func_1` to determine if the array is already sorted, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Correctness:
**False**
