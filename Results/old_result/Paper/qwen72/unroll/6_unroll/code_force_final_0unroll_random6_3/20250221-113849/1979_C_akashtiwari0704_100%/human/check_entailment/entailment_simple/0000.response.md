### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it reads inputs directly from `stdin`. This is a common practice in competitive programming and does not affect the correctness of the solution.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop.

2. **LCM Calculation**:
   - The function `lcm` is defined to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers. This is used to find a common multiple for the multipliers `k_i`.
   - The LCM is calculated using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b // gcd(a, b)`, which is extended to a list of numbers.

3. **Betting Strategy**:
   - For each test case, the function reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
   - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated and stored in `prod`.
   - Each bet `a[i]` is set to `prod // a[i]`, which ensures that the total bet on all outcomes is the sum of these values.
   - The sum of all bets is calculated and stored in `sumo`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the sum of all bets `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the function outputs `-1`, indicating that it is not possible to distribute the coins as required.
   - Otherwise, the function outputs the bets as a space-separated string.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the bets are distributed in such a way that the condition is met if possible.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem.
- The logic for calculating the bets and checking the condition is sound and follows the problem constraints.
- The program will output the correct results for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
