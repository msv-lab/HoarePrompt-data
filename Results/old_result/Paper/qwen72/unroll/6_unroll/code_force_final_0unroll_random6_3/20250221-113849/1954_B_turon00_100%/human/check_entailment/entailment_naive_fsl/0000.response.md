Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful and no elements need to be removed. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The array `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is not beautiful because there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`. However, the program will still attempt to find the minimum number of elements to remove, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, if the array is already not beautiful, the output should be `0`, but the program does not account for this case and will output `-1` instead.
