Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, operations is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x (b âˆˆ {1, 2}, 1 <= x <= n for b=1, 1 <= x <= 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after all operations.**
