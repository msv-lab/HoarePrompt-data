### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `func_3()` to split and map the input to integers. This is a standard and correct way to handle input in Python for the given problem.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Each Throw:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This is correct because it accounts for both clockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This is also correct because it accounts for both counterclockwise throws and unknown directions.
   - The program then updates `ans` to be the set `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because player numbers are from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - This function reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. It is used to read the input lines and is correct for the given problem.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - This function reads a single integer from the input. It is used to read the number of test cases `t` and is correct.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
  - This function reads a line from the input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. It is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case and is correct.

- **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
  - **Initialization:**
    - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`. This is correct.
  - **Processing Each Throw:**
    - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
    - It correctly handles the direction '0' (clockwise) and '?' (unknown) by adding `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
    - It correctly handles the direction '1' (counterclockwise) and '?' (unknown) by adding `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
    - The set `ans` is updated to `temp` after processing each throw, which is correct.
  - **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
    - The program checks if `0` is in `ans` and replaces it with `n`. This is necessary because player numbers are from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be adjusted to `n`.
  - **Output:**
    - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players. This is correct as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, processes each throw, adjusts for player numbering, and outputs the correct results. There are no logical errors or issues in the implementation that would cause incorrect behavior for valid inputs.

Final: **True**
