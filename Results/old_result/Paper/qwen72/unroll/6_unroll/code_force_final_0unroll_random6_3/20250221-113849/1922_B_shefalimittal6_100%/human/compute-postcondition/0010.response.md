The function `func_1` is expected to accept parameters for the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the number of sticks `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The inputs should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters. Assuming the function is correctly defined with the parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of sticks `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
