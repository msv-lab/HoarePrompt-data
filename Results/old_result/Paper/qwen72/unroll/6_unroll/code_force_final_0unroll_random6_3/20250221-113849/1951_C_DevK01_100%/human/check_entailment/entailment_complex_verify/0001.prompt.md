You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, the total cost of buying `k` tickets has been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values or are reset for each test case, while the variables `L`, `M`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` are used and modified within the loop but do not persist outside of each test case iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of sale days, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. The second line contains a list of `n` integers representing the ticket prices for each day. The function calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` days, ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any single day. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial values or are reset for each test case, while other variables used within the loop do not persist outside of each test case iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the ticket prices `M` from the second line.
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days Needed:**
   - The program calculates the number of days `q` needed to buy all `k` tickets using `math.ceil(k / m)`. This is correct because it ensures that we account for the possibility of needing a partial day to buy the remaining tickets.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This is correct because it ensures that we are buying tickets at the lowest possible prices.

5. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the program calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula is derived from the sum of the prices of the tickets bought each day and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the program adjusts by buying the remaining tickets on the last day. It calculates the cost for the remaining tickets and adds it to the total cost.

6. **Handling the Remaining Tickets:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the remaining tickets are bought on the last day by popping the last element from `N` and calculating the cost for the remaining tickets.

7. **Final Cost Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the final cost by summing the costs of the tickets bought each day and the additional costs due to the price increase.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `m` correctly. If `k` is less than `m`, the program should buy all `k` tickets on the first day and not proceed to the next days.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, the program should buy all `k` tickets on the first day and calculate the cost accordingly.

### Correctness:
- The program has a logical error in handling the case where `k` is less than `m` and when `n` is 1. These edge cases need to be addressed to ensure the program works correctly for all inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
