### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and if so, provide a valid configuration.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks three conditions:
     1. **If `n == k`:**
        - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy one jewel from a single stall priced at 1 coin.
        - This is a valid configuration, so the program prints "YES", followed by 1 and 1.
     2. **If `n + 2 > k * 2`:**
        - This condition can be rewritten as `n > 2 * k - 2`.
        - This condition ensures that Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin.
        - This is a valid configuration because Alice will buy `k-1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels.
     3. **Otherwise:**
        - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "NO".
        - This implies that it is impossible to set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1 (`n == k`):**
     - This is a straightforward case where Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin.
     - This condition is correct.
   - **Condition 2 (`n + 2 > k * 2`):**
     - This condition ensures that Alice has enough coins to buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins and 1 jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin.
     - The condition `n > 2 * k - 2` is derived from the requirement that Alice must have at least `k-1` coins left after buying `k-1` jewels from the first stall.
     - This condition is also correct.
   - **Condition 3 (else):**
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels in any valid configuration.
     - This condition is correct.

4. **Output Validation:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices when the conditions are met.
   - The program correctly prints "NO" when the conditions are not met.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the conditions it checks.

Correctness: **True**
