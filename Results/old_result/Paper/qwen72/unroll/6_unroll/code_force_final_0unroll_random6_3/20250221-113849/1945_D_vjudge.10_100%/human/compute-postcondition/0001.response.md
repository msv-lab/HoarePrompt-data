To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop will iterate over the range starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the ending value (`-1`), and the step value (`-1`) ensures that we are decrementing.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable will be adjusted by the loop itself, starting from `n - 1` and decrementing to `0`.
2. **Variable `n`**: This variable must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because `n - 1` would be `-1`, and the loop would not start.

Given the initial state:
- `pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4).
- `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), where each element `a_i` and `b_i` satisfies (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9).
- `n` and `m` are integers such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000).
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `x` is 0.

The only variable that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `n`. Specifically, `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ pergunta ≤ 10^4), `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), where each element `a_i` and `b_i` satisfies (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer such that (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `x` is 0, and `i` is `n - 1`**.
