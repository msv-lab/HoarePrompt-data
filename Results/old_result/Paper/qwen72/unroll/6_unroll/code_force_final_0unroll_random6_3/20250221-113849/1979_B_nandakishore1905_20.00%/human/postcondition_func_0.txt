The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It processes a series of inputs provided by the user. For each input pair `(n, m)`, it calculates a value based on specific conditions and prints the result. The function does not modify any external variables `x` and `y` that might be present in the calling context. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged, and the program has printed a series of results based on the input pairs.
