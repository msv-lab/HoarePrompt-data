Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final result should be output modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads a list `l` of `n` integers.

2. **Finding the Maximum Contiguous Subarray Sum:**
   - The program initializes `c` (current sum) and `maxi` (maximum sum) to 0.
   - It iterates through the list `l`:
     - If the current element `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it resets `c` to 0 and updates `maxi` with the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` with the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it ensures `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

3. **Calculating the Final Result:**
   - The program computes the final result using the formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Maximum Contiguous Subarray Sum:**
  - The program correctly identifies the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray that does not include any negative number which would cause the sum to reset. This is a good approach because the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is a key component in determining the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
  - However, the logic for handling negative numbers and resetting `c` is not entirely correct. The program should consider the possibility of including negative numbers in the subarray if they can contribute to a larger sum in subsequent operations.

- **Final Result Calculation:**
  - The formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum(l)}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is intended to account for the effect of `k` operations on the maximum sum. However, this formula is not correct for all cases.
  - The correct approach should be to consider the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations, which can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray to itself. The formula should be \((\text{sum(l)} + k \times \text{maxi}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Corrected Formula:
The correct formula to use is:
\[
(\text{sum(l)} + k \times \text{maxi}) \mod (10^9 + 7)
\]

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        maxi = float('-inf')
        current_max = 0
        
        for ele in l:
            current_max = max(ele, current_max + ele)
            maxi = max(maxi, current_max)
        
        total_sum = sum(l)
        
        print((total_sum + k * maxi) % 1000000007)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Finding the Maximum Contiguous Subarray Sum:**
  - The program uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. This is done by maintaining `current_max` and `maxi`.
  - `current_max` is updated to the maximum of the current element and the sum of the current element and the previous `current_max`.
  - `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `current_max` and the previous `maxi`.

- **Final Result Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the total sum of the array `l`.
  - It then computes the final result using the corrected formula \((\text{sum(l)} + k \times \text{maxi}) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to compute the final result. The corrected program uses the correct logic and formula to solve the problem.
