### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `a`.

2. **Constraints Handling:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M` to ensure that tickets are bought on the cheapest days first. This is a crucial step for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets. This is correct because if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, you need an additional day to buy the remaining tickets.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought on the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the number of tickets needed is exactly the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets per day. In this case, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the number of tickets needed is not exactly the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets per day. In this case, the program calculates the cost for the remaining tickets and adds it to the total cost.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `m` is greater than `k` by setting `m` to `k`.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is not a multiple of `m` by calculating the cost for the remaining tickets.

8. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for minimizing the cost of buying `k` tickets over `n` days with the given constraints. The sorting and cost calculation steps are appropriate for the problem, and the edge cases are handled correctly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
