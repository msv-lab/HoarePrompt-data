The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `t` is already defined as an input integer with a range of 1 to 500, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500)**
