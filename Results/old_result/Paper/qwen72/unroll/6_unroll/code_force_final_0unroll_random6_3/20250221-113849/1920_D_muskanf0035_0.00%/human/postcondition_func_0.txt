The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple is `(op_type, value)` with `op_type` being 1 or 2 and `value` a positive integer, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It constructs an `array` based on the operations provided: if `op_type` is 1, it appends `value` to the `array`; if `op_type` is 2, it duplicates the `array` by extending it with its current elements. The function then returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by `queries`, where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The original `n`, `operations`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
