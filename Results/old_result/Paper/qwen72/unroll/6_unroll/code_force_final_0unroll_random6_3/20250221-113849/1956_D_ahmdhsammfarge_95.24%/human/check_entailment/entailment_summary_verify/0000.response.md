### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(lst)`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to apply the operation that maximizes the sum of the array.
- **Logic**:
  - It initializes `r` and `l` to 0 and `over_sum` to the sum of the initial array.
  - It iterates over all possible subarrays of `lst` and computes a new sum `sm` by replacing the subarray `lst[i:j+1]` with a subarray of length `j - i + 1` where each element is the length of the subarray.
  - If `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, it updates `over_sum` and the optimal range `[r, l]`.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not compute the MEX value for the chosen subarray. Instead, it replaces the subarray with a subarray of the same length where each element is the length of the subarray. This is not the correct operation as per the problem description.
  - The function only finds one optimal range and does not consider multiple operations or the possibility of achieving a higher sum with different operations.

#### Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to append operations to the list `ops` to achieve the desired transformation.
- **Logic**:
  - If `r == l`, it appends a single operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
  - Otherwise, it recursively appends operations for the range `[r, l-1]`, appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]`, and then appends more operations for the range `[r, l-1]`.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not compute the MEX value for the subarray and does not set the elements of the subarray to the MEX value.
  - The recursive calls and the way operations are appended do not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`
- **Purpose**: This function is supposed to apply the operation to the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` and update the list `ops` with the operations performed.
- **Logic**:
  - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops`.
  - If the minimum value in the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` is 0, it appends the same operation again.
  - It appends the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` to `ops`.
  - It recursively calls `func_2` to append more operations.
  - It sets the elements of the subarray `lst[r:l+1]` to the length of the subarray `n`.
- **Issues**:
  - The function does not compute the MEX value for the subarray.
  - The operations appended do not align with the problem's requirements.
  - The recursive calls to `func_2` are unnecessary and do not contribute to the correct solution.

### Specific Case Analysis
Let's consider the specific case provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: `4\n1 100 2 1`
- **Expected Output**: `105 2\n3 3\n3 4`

#### Expected Behavior
- The MEX of the subarray `[2]` is 0, so the operation `[3, 3]` should set `a[2]` to 0.
- The MEX of the subarray `[2, 1]` is 0, so the operation `[3, 4]` should set `a[2]` and `a[3]` to 2.
- The final array should be `[1, 100, 2, 2]`, and the sum should be 105.

#### Actual Behavior
- `func_1` does not compute the MEX value and instead replaces the subarray with a subarray of the same length where each element is the length of the subarray.
- `func_3` does not compute the MEX value and sets the elements to the length of the subarray, which is incorrect.
- The operations appended to `ops` do not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the given operation. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not compute the MEX value and do not apply the operations correctly as per the problem description.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
