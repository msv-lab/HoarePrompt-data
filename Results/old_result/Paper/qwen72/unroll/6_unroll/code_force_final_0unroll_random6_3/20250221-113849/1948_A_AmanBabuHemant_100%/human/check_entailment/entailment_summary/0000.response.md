### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct because a string with an odd number of special characters cannot be constructed where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., 'AA', 'BB') to satisfy the condition.

3. **Even `n` Handling**:
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern 'AAB' `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' in 'AAB' is a special character because it is equal to one of its neighbors (the next 'A' or the previous 'A'). The 'B' in 'AAB' is not a special character.
   - The function then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. This is correct because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, it can be of length at most 200. Since `n` is at most 50, the maximum length of `s` is `50 * 3 = 150`, which is always less than 200.
   - If the length of `s` is not less than 200, it prints 'NO'. However, this condition will never be met because the maximum length of `s` is 150, which is always less than 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and requirements. It prints 'NO' for odd `n` and constructs a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's conditions. The length check for `s` is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**
