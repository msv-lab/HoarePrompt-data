You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid. Each string consists only of the characters '<' and '>', and n is even. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop iterates over the number of test cases specified by `t`. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. After processing, the loop prints 'No' if the second-to-last character in `b` is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each test case, and their values are not retained between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length `n` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid. The function returns a list of results, where each result is "YES" if it is possible to rotate the arrows in the grid such that no arrow points to another arrow in the same column, or "NO" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
