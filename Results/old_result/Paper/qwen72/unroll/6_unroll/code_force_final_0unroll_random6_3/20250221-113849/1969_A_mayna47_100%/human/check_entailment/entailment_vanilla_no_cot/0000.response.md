Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in handling the test cases. The function `func_1()` is called `t` times, but it does not correctly handle the requirement to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. Specifically, the program only checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. However, it does not correctly handle cases where no such direct pair exists but a cycle or a chain of friendships can still result in at least 2 friends attending the party.

For example, in the second test case:
- Input: `4\n2 3 4 1`
- The program will print `3` because it does not find a direct pair of friends who are each other's best friends. However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 both come to the party (since 1's best friend is 2 and 2's best friend is 3, and 3's best friend is 4, and 4's best friend is 1, forming a cycle).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify cycles in the friendship graph.
2. Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to break the cycles and ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

The current implementation does not handle these aspects, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.
