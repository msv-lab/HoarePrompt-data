### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove elements that would otherwise be included by Alice, especially those that are unique and small.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.

4. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It initializes a variable `first` to `False` to track if Alice has picked a unique element.
     - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`:
       - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`, which is the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means Alice has already picked a unique element, and Bob will pick the next unique element, making `i` the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`. This means Alice will pick this unique element on her next turn.

5. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.
   - It ensures that Alice picks unique elements first, and Bob picks the next unique elements, which is the optimal strategy for both players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Correctness:
**True**
