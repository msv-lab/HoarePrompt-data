Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute bets such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - The multiplier for each outcome is given by \( k_i \).
   - If a solution exists, it should be outputted as a list of integers \( x_i \) (1 ≤ \( x_i \) ≤ 10^9).
   - If no solution exists, output -1.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - It calculates the product \( m \) of all multipliers \( k_i \).
   - It then calculates the bets \( c_i \) for each outcome as \( \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - It finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets \( c \) using the function `func_1`.
   - It reduces the bets by dividing each by the GCD.
   - It checks if the sum of the reduced bets is less than \( \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} \). If it is, it prints the reduced bets; otherwise, it prints -1.

3. **Critical Points**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product \( m \) of all multipliers \( k_i \) is calculated. This ensures that each bet \( c_i \) is a multiple of the other bets.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of the bets is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values that still satisfy the condition.
   - **Sum Check**: The sum of the reduced bets is compared to \( \frac{m}{\text{GCD}} \) to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Overflow**: The product \( m \) can become very large, potentially causing overflow. However, since \( k_i \) is limited to 20 and \( n \) is limited to 50, the product \( m \) will not exceed the limits of Python's integer type.
   - **GCD Calculation**: The GCD calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are reduced to the smallest possible values.
   - **Sum Check**: The sum check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists.
   - The constraints and the logic used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
