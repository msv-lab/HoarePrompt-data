The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. The function is expected to process these test cases, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, I will assume the function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified. If you can provide more details about the output for each test case, I can refine the description.
