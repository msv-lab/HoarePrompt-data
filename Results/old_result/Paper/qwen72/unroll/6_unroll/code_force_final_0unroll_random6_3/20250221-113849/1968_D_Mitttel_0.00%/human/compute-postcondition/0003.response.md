Output State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that a new variable `visited` has been introduced and initialized as an empty dictionary.
