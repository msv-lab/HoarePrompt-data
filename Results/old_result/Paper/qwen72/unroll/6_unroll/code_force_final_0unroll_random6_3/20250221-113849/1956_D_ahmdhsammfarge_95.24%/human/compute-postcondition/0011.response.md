Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. It modifies the list `ops` by appending several operations, and it returns the list `lst` with the elements from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) set to the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`. The rest of the elements in `lst` remain unchanged. The function also ensures that if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, an additional operation is appended to `ops`. **
