Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It also reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the state of the board.

2. **State Update**: The program updates the size of the chessboard `n` based on the moves made. If a move is made at a position `(a, b)` where `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook). If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations of the board after all valid moves are made. The dynamic programming approach is used to calculate the sequence of values, where each value represents the number of ways to place rooks on a board of a given size.

4. **DP Formula**: The formula used in the DP function is:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`
   This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i` by considering the previous two states:
   - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size `i-1` without any new rook.
   - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place a new rook on a board of size `i` by considering the positions where the new rook can be placed and the mirrored positions.

5. **DP Initialization and Update**: The DP list `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which is correct for the base cases. The program then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP list and ensuring that only the last two values are kept in memory.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
