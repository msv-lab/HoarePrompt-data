The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each containing three parameters: an integer `n`, a string `s`, and a string `f`. The integer `n` represents the number of boxes, and the strings `s` and `f` represent the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. Each character in `s` and `f` is either '0' or '1'. The function processes each test case and returns the number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `f` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of boxes, a string `s` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the initial state of the boxes, and a string `f` of `n` characters ('0' or '1') representing the desired state of the boxes. It returns the number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the desired state `f` for each test case.**
