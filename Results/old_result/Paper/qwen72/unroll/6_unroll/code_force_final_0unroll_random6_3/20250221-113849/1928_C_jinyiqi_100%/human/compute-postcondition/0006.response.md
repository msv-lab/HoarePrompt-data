The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is Vasya's position in the line. The function returns a list that combines two sublists: `output1` and `output2`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding complementary divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, followed by their corresponding complementary divisors.**
