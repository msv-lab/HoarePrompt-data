Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers `a` and `b`.
   - It uses the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) // GCD(a, b)`, which is correct.
   - The function is used correctly in `func_2` to compute the LCM of the multipliers.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals` for each outcome.
   - It then computes the LCM of all the multipliers in `vals` using `func_1`.
   - The variable `den` is set to this LCM.
   - It computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den // r` for each multiplier `r` in `vals`.
   - It then checks if `den - sum(vprod) <= 0`. If this condition is true, it prints `-1` and returns, indicating that it is impossible to distribute the coins as required.
   - If the condition is false, it prints the list `vprod` as the solution.

3. **Correctness of the Approach**:
   - The approach is to find a common multiple of all the multipliers (`den`), and then distribute the coins such that the total bet is `den - sum(vprod)`.
   - For the solution to be valid, `den` must be greater than the sum of `vprod` for all outcomes.
   - If `den` is the LCM of all multipliers, then `den // r` for each `r` in `vals` will ensure that the total bet is `den - sum(vprod)`, which should be less than `den`.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where it is impossible to distribute the coins (e.g., when all multipliers are the same and equal to 2, the LCM is 2, and the total bet would be 2 * N, which is not less than 2 * N).
   - The function also handles the case where the multipliers are different and a valid distribution is possible.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with multipliers `[3, 2, 7]`, the LCM is 42. The bets are `[14, 21, 6]`, and the total bet is 41. The returns are `[42, 42, 42]`, which are all greater than 41.
   - For the second test case with multipliers `[3, 3]`, the LCM is 3. The bets are `[1, 1]`, and the total bet is 2. The returns are `[3, 3]`, which are both greater than 2.
   - For the third test case with multipliers `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, the LCM is 5. The bets are `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, and the total bet is 5. The returns are `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, which are all equal to 5, so the function correctly prints `-1`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
