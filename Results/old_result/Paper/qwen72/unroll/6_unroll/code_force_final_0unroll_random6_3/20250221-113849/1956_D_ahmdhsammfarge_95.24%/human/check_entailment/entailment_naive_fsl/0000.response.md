Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the sum of the elements of the array using the given operation. Specifically, the function `func_1` is intended to find the optimal range `[r, l]` to apply the operation, but it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the chosen range. Additionally, the functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not follow the problem description accurately. The program does not ensure that the chosen operation is applied correctly and does not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output. The logic in `func_1` for calculating the new sum and the logic in `func_3` for applying the operations are flawed and do not align with the problem's requirements.
