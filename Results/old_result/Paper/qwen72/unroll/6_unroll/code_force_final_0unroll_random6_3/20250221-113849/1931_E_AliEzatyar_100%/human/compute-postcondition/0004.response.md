The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `num` is constrained to be between 1 and 2 Â· 10^5, and each integer in the list `num` is constrained to be between 1 and 10^9. The function returns the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`, and the list `num` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list, while ensuring that the list `num` remains unchanged.**
