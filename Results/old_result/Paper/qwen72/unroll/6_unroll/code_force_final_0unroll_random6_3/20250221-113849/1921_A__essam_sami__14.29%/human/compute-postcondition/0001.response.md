To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `steps` and `t`.

1. **Variable `t`**: The loop `for steps in range(t):` will execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.
2. **Variable `steps`**: This variable is initialized by the loop itself and will start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the coordinates (x, y) of a corner of the square, and the list contains exactly four tuples.
- The coordinates x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000.
- The input list represents the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
- `t` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `steps` will be initialized by the loop and will start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0**
