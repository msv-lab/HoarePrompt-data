Output State: **The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of tuples (a, b) as input. `T` is an input integer.**
