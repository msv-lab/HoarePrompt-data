You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The loop executes t times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers A, B, and C from the input. Depending on the conditions, it prints either A * B, A * C / 2 (if A is even), or X (A // 2) followed by X * C + B (if A is odd). The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains the number of test cases, `t`.
   - Each test case contains three integers: `n` (number of yogurts), `a` (price of one yogurt), and `b` (price of two yogurts on promotion).

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, print the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts.

### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Reading the Number of Test Cases:**
   - `for i in range(int(input())):` correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.

2. **Reading the Test Case Input:**
   - `(A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())` correctly reads the three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case and assigns them to `A`, `B`, and `C` respectively.

3. **Comparing Regular Price and Promotion Price:**
   - `if B * 2 < C:` checks if the regular price for two yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
   - If true, it prints `A * B`, which means buying all yogurts at the regular price. This is correct because if the regular price is cheaper, it's always better to buy all yogurts at the regular price.

4. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - `elif A % 2 == 0:` checks if the number of yogurts `n` is even.
   - If true, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price. This is correct because if `n` is even, all yogurts can be bought in pairs at the promotion price.

5. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - `else:` handles the case where the number of yogurts `n` is odd.
   - `X = A // 2` calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought.
   - `print(X)` prints the number of pairs, which is incorrect. The program should not print this intermediate value.
   - `print(X * C + B)` calculates the total cost by buying `X` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is correct.

### Issues:
- The program incorrectly prints the number of pairs `X` in the odd number of yogurts case. This should not be printed as it is not part of the required output.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct but has an unnecessary print statement in the odd number of yogurts case. Removing this print statement will make the program correct.

Correctness: **False**
