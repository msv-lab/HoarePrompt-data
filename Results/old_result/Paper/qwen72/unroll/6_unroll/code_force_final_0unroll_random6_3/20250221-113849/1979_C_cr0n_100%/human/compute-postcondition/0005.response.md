The code snippet `vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]` creates a new list `vprod` where each element is the result of dividing `den` (the greatest common divisor of all integers in `vals`) by each element `r` in the list `vals`.

Output State: **N remains the same, `vals` remains the same, `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**
