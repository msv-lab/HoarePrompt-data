#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of elements in array `a`), `m` (an integer representing the number of elements in array `b`), and `k` (an integer representing the required number of matching elements), followed by two lists `a` and `b` of integers. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all i. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]

        C = cnt_bb - D

                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                    C[in_aa] += 1
                else:
                    D[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1

    #State: The loop will have processed `nabors` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `aa` that contain at least `k` elements matching the elements in the list `bb`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `aa`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `tot`, and `fnd` will be updated and reset for each test case, but the overall state of the program will not be affected beyond the scope of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `a` that contain at least `k` elements matching the elements in the list `b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is reset for each new test case, with no lasting effects on the overall program state.
