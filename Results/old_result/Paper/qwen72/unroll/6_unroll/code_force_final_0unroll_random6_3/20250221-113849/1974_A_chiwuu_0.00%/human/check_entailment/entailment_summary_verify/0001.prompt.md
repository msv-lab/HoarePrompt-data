You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the input, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs a series of calculations to determine a value `t`, and prints `t`. The values of `a` and `b` are processed independently in each iteration, and the function does not affect any external variables or parameters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The formula `t = b * 2` is used to determine the total number of 2x2 icons, which is then divided by 5 to find the number of screens needed. If there is a remainder, it adds 1 to the screen count. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 3 (15/5) 2x2 icons, and any remaining icons will require an additional screen.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done using `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`), it does not change the screen count `t`.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the 1x1 icons. This is done using `t2 = a - t1`.
   - The formula `t = t + t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 > 0)` is used to determine the additional screens needed. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the remaining icons that do not fill a complete screen.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the placement of 2x2 icons and calculates the number of screens needed for them.
- It also correctly calculates the remaining cells and determines if they are sufficient for the 1x1 icons.
- If additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons, it correctly calculates the number of additional screens required.

However, there is a minor issue in the logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons. The formula `t = b * 2` is incorrect because it should be `t = b * 4` since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. This mistake affects the subsequent calculations.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 4
        if t % 15 == 0:
            t = t // 15
        else:
            t = t // 15 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons.
- After correcting the error, the program should work correctly.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the initial calculation of `t` for 2x2 icons).
