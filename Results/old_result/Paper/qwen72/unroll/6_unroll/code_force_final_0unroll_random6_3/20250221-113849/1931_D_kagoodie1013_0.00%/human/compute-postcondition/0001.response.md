To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains the required elements.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: a list of integers `a` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) of length `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y <= 10^9).
- `results` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute:
- `test_cases` must be a non-empty list.
- The first tuple in `test_cases` must have the correct structure: `(n, x, y, arr)`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `test_cases` is non-empty and the first tuple is correctly structured.

State: **`test_cases` is a non-empty list of tuples, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` as specified, and `results` is an empty list.**
