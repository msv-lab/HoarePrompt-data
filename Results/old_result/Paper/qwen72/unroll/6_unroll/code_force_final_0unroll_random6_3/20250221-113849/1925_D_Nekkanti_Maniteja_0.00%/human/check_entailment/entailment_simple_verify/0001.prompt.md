You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - The teacher goes on `k` excursions and randomly picks pairs of children.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen, and output this value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a pair of friends chosen in each excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs plus the expected increase due to the chosen pairs.
   - The expected increase in the sum of friendship values for each excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (i + a)\), where `i` is the current excursion number and `a` is the sum of initial friendship values.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - We need to compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) is used to compute the probability.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)`.
   - It initializes `s` to store the expected sum and `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
   - It reads the initial friendship values and adds them to `a`.
   - It iterates over `k` excursions, updating the expected sum `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Potential Issues:**
   - The calculation of the modular inverse is correct.
   - The expected increase in friendship values is correctly calculated as \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (i + a)\).
   - However, the program has a logical error in the way it updates the expected sum `s`. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect. The expected increase should be \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times (i + a)\), which simplifies to `c * (i + a) * m`.

7. **Corrected Calculation:**
   - The correct update for `s` should be:
     ```python
     s = s + c * (i + a) * m
     ```

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a logical error in the way it updates the expected sum `s`. The term `c * i * c * m` should be simplified to `c * (i + a) * m` to correctly calculate the expected increase in friendship values.
