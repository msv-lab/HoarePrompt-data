Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers from the user. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in the list. If the GCD minus the sum of the GCD divided by each integer in the list is less than or equal to zero, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the GCD divided by each integer in the list. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
