The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given constraints alone. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 20,000; `n`, an integer between 1 and 200,000; and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.**
