You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Function Summary: 
The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line, and for each line, it extracts two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints a value based on the formula `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)`. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n` and `k` are not retained after each iteration of the loop. The final state of the program is the printed output for each valid input line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color a minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The output for each test case is a single integer representing the minimum number of cells to be colored.

3. **Diagonal Coloring Strategy:**
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should aim to color cells that belong to multiple diagonals.
   - The most efficient way to do this is to color cells along the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left).

4. **Cases to Consider:**
   - **Case 1: \( k \leq 2n - 1 \)**
     - In this case, we can achieve the required \( k \) diagonals by coloring \( k \) cells along the main or anti-diagonal.
     - The formula for this case is \( k // 2 + k % 2 \), which is equivalent to \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

   - **Case 2: \( 2n \leq k < 4n - 2 \)**
     - Here, we need to color more than \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals.
     - We can achieve this by coloring \( 2n - 1 \) cells along the main and anti-diagonals, which covers \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals each.
     - The remaining \( k - (2n - 1) \) diagonals can be covered by coloring additional cells.
     - The formula for this case is \( 2n \).

   - **Case 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - In this case, we need to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
     - This can be achieved by coloring \( 2n - 1 \) cells along the main diagonal and \( 2n - 1 \) cells along the anti-diagonal, but one cell is counted twice (the center cell if \( n \) is odd).
     - The formula for this case is \( 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input line into \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[
     \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2)
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) calculates \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - \( (k < 4n - 3) \) is a boolean expression that is 1 if \( k < 4n - 3 \) and 0 otherwise.
     - \( 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) \) ensures that if \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the result is at least \( 2n \).
     - \( (k == 4n - 2) \) adds 1 to the result if \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \).

6. **Verification:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n - 1 \), the formula correctly returns \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
   - For \( 2n \leq k < 4n - 2 \), the formula correctly returns \( 2n \).
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the formula correctly returns \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases and outputs the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
