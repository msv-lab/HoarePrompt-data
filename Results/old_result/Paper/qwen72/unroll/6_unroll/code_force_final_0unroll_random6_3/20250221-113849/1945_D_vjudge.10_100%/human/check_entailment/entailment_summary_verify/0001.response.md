### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCasos`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `pergunta` is initialized to `float('inf')`, which is a good starting point for finding the minimum value.

3. **Loop and Calculation:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order. This is appropriate because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.
   - For each position `i`, the program checks if `i` is less than `m`. If it is, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
   - The variable `x` is updated by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. This is done to accumulate the cost of bribing people as Kirill moves forward in the queue.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `pergunta`, which should be the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Loop:**
  - The loop correctly iterates from the end of the queue to the beginning.
  - The condition `if i < m` ensures that Kirill only considers positions within the first `m` positions.
  - The update `pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])` correctly calculates the minimum cost to move to position `i` by considering the current accumulated cost `x` and the cost `a[i]` to move to position `i`.

- **Accumulation of Costs:**
  - The accumulation `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is correct because it adds the minimum cost of bribing the person at position `i` or the cost of moving past them.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `m` is equal to `n` correctly. In this case, Kirill can stay in his original position without any cost.
  - The program also handles the case where `m` is 1 correctly. Kirill will have to pay the minimum cost to move to the first position.

### Issues Identified:

- **Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called with the initial value of `pergunta` as `float('inf')`, but the function summary incorrectly states that `pergunta` is an integer representing the number of test cases. This is a discrepancy in the function summary, but the actual function call is correct.
  - The function `func_1` should be called with the correct parameters, and it is in the provided code.

- **Logic for Minimum Cost Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is correct. The function iterates from the end of the queue, considering the cost to move to each position and the accumulated cost of bribing or moving past people.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The function summary had a minor discrepancy, but the actual function call and logic are correct.
