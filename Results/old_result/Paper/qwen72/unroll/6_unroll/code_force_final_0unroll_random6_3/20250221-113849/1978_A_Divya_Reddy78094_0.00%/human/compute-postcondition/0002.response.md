Output State: **t is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of books. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the number of pages in each book. The loop has printed the sum of the pages of the two largest books for each test case.**
