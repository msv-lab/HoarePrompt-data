Output State: **`lst` has been updated such that the elements from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) are all set to the value `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The values of `r`, `l`, `ops`, and `n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The slice of `lst` from index `r` to index `l` (inclusive) is replaced with a list of `n` elements, each with the value `n`.
- `n` is calculated as `l - r + 1`, which represents the number of elements in the slice from `r` to `l` (inclusive).
- The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain the same as they were in the initial state.
