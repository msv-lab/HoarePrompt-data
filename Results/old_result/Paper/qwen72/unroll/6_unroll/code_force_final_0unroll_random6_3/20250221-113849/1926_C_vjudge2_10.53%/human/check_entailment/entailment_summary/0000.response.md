### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two lists: `values` and `sum_values`.
   - `values` is used to store the sum of the digits of each number.
   - `sum_values` is used to store the cumulative sum of the `values` up to each number.

3. **Base Case:**
   - The program correctly initializes the first 10 elements of `values` and `sum_values` with the sum of digits of numbers from 0 to 9. This is correct because the sum of the digits of a single-digit number is the number itself.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9.
   - For each number `i` from 10 to `n`, it splits the number into its last digit and the remaining part.
   - It then calculates the sum of digits for `i` by adding the sum of the last digit and the sum of the remaining part.
   - This approach is correct and efficient for calculating the sum of digits for larger numbers.

5. **Cumulative Sum:**
   - The program correctly updates the `sum_values` list by adding the current value to the cumulative sum of the previous values.
   - This ensures that `sum_values[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the test cases, which is the required output.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently calculates the sum of digits using a dynamic programming approach, which is suitable for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, which is within the 0.5 seconds time limit for the given constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles the input and output as specified. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the time constraints.
