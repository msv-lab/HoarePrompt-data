### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the second type of operation (b=2) in `func_1`. Let's break down the problem and the code to understand why:

1. **Problem Description:**
   - Operation 1 (b=1): Append an integer `x` to the array.
   - Operation 2 (b=2): Append `x` copies of the current array to itself. This means the array should be repeated `x` times, not just once.

2. **Current Implementation in `func_1`:**
   - For operation 1 (b=1), the code correctly appends the integer `x` to the array.
   - For operation 2 (b=2), the code incorrectly extends the array by one copy of itself, regardless of the value of `x`. The line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is equivalent to `array.extend(array)`, which only appends one copy of the array.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly handle operation 2, the line should be `array.extend(array * (value - 1))` to append `x` copies of the array to itself. The `value - 1` is necessary because the array is already one copy of itself, so we need to add `x - 1` more copies.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     5 10
     1 1
     1 2
     2 3
     1 3
     2 3
     1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
     ```
   - After the first operation, the array is `[1]`.
   - After the second operation, the array is `[1, 2]`.
   - After the third operation (b=2, x=3), the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` because it should be repeated 3 times. However, the current implementation will only result in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`.
   - After the fourth operation, the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - After the fifth operation (b=2, x=3), the array should be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` because it should be repeated 3 times. However, the current implementation will only result in `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

5. **Function Summary for `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1` with the appropriate arguments. The function correctly handles the input and output format but relies on the incorrect behavior of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the second type of operation (b=2) as described in the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
