#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`, `ps` is the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each complete set of the first `k` alphabets encountered in `s`, `ps` is the number of times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets was encountered in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: - The `print` statement will always output the string `'NO'`.
    #
    #Output:
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop prints a string for each character in the set `us` that is not in `win`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` concatenated with the current character from `us` and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a string `s` from the input. It processes the string `s` to find sequences of characters that form a complete set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the function finds at least `n` such complete sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After printing 'NO', the function prints a string for each character in the set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that was not part of any complete set found in `s`. Each string is composed of the characters in `ans` (the last character of each complete set found), concatenated with the current character from the set, and then padded with 'a' characters to reach a total length of `n`. The function returns `None` in all cases.
