You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)` and it must be less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values and uses it to determine the bets.
   - It then calculates the bets as `m / k_i` for each outcome.
   - The program finds the highest common factor (HCF) of these bets and normalizes them by dividing by the HCF.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Analysis of the Program:**
   - **Product Calculation:**
     - The product `m` of all `k_i` values is calculated. This ensures that each `x_i` is a multiple of the product of the other `k_j` values.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - The bets are calculated as `m / k_i`. This ensures that the return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * (m / k_i) = m`, which is the same for all outcomes.
   - **HCF Calculation:**
     - The HCF of the bets is calculated to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - **Sum Check:**
     - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. This is crucial because if the sum is greater or equal to `m / hcf`, the total bet will not be strictly less than the return for any outcome.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach ensures that the return for any winning outcome is `m`, which is the same for all outcomes.
   - The HCF normalization reduces the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the required condition.
   - The sum check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any outcome.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The product `m` can become very large, especially for large `n` and `k_i` values. However, the program uses the HCF to reduce the bets, which should handle this issue.
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return.
   - For `n = 2` and `k_1 = k_2`, the program correctly prints `-1` because the sum of the bets would be equal to the return.
   - For larger `n` and different `k_i` values, the program should work as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
