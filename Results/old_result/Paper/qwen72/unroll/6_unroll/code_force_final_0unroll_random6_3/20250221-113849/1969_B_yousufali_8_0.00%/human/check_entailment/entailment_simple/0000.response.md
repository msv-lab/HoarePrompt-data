Reasoning:  

The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The approach taken by the program is to count the number of 1s (`n`) and calculate the cost (`ans`) based on the positions of 0s that come after 1s. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Input Parsing in `func_1`:** The input is parsed using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. Binary strings do not contain spaces, so `split()` will not produce the expected list of integers. Instead, `input()` should be used to read the string, and then each character should be converted to an integer.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation:** The logic for calculating the cost in `func_1` is flawed. The program adds `n + 1` to `ans` for each 0 encountered after a 1. This does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to sort the string. The correct approach should consider the cost of making the string sorted by performing the minimum number of cyclic shifts on the smallest possible substrings.

3. **Handling of Already Sorted Strings:** The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For an already sorted string, the cost should be 0, but the current logic will still add to `ans` if there are 0s after 1s, which is incorrect.

4. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases such as strings with only 0s or only 1s, or strings that are already sorted.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
