### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program uses a loop to iterate over possible values of `i` from 1 to `b`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates \(x\) as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\).
   - If \(x\) is greater than 0, it adds \(x\) to the sum `suma`.
   - It then checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\). If both conditions are true, it adds 1 to `suma`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all values of `i`, the program prints `suma - 2` as the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)**:
  - This condition can be rewritten as \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).
  - This implies that \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **Loop and Calculation**:
  - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `b`, which is correct for the range of `b`.
  - The calculation of \(x\) as \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) is intended to find the number of valid `a` values for each `i`.
  - However, the logic for calculating \(x\) and the subsequent checks are not correctly aligned with the problem statement.

- **Error in the Calculation**:
  - The expression \(\left(\frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2}\right) + 1\) does not directly correspond to the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.
  - The conditions \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\) are not necessary and do not align with the problem's requirements.

- **Output Adjustment**:
  - The program subtracts 2 from `suma` before printing, which is not justified by the problem statement and may lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic and the incorrect output adjustment, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
