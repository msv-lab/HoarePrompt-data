Precondition: **The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the coordinates (x, y) of a corner of the square, and the list contains exactly four tuples. The coordinates x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The input list represents the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

Given the function definition is incomplete, it should be:
```python
def func(test_cases):
```
Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each inner list containing four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.
