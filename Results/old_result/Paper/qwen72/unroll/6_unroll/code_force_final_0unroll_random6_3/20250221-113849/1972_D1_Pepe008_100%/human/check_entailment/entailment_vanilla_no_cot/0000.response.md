Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` is not correct for determining the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1 > 0` is also not appropriate for the problem.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not justified based on the problem statement.
   - The condition `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is not necessary and does not help in solving the problem.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Valid Pairs:**
   - The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

This program correctly iterates over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, this approach is not efficient for large values of \(n\) and \(m\) (up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\)). For better performance, you would need to optimize the solution, possibly by using properties of the gcd and modular arithmetic.
