Output State: The loop will print a series of encoded words based on the input values of `n` for each test case. The variable `i` will have iterated from 0 to `t-1`, and the variable `word` will be reset and recalculated for each iteration. The variable `n` will be the last input value for the final test case. The `alphabet` string remains unchanged as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
