Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it updates the sliding window and the sum of matches (`sm`). Specifically, the logic for updating the `sm` variable when the window slides is incorrect. The program should correctly account for the addition and removal of elements from the sliding window and update the match count (`sm`) accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(b)
    ca = Counter(a[:m])
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if sm >= k:
        ans += 1
    for r in range(m, n):
        # Add the new element to the window
        new_element = a[r]
        ca[new_element] += 1
        if new_element in cb and ca[new_element] <= cb[new_element]:
            sm += 1
        
        # Remove the old element from the window
        old_element = a[r - m]
        if old_element in cb and ca[old_element] <= cb[old_element]:
            sm -= 1
        ca[old_element] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, k, a, b))
```

### Explanation of the Corrections:
1. **Initialization of `ca` and `sm`**:
   - `ca` is initialized with the first `m` elements of `a`.
   - `sm` is the sum of the values of the intersection of `ca` and `cb`.

2. **Sliding Window Update**:
   - When adding a new element to the window (`a[r]`), the program checks if this element is in `cb` and if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm`.
   - When removing an old element from the window (`a[r - m]`), the program checks if this element is in `cb` and if its count in `ca` is less than or equal to its count in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm`.

3. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - After each update, the program checks if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k` and increments `ans` if it is.

This corrected version ensures that the sliding window is updated correctly and the match count is accurately maintained, leading to the correct count of good subsegments.
