The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. The variable `num` will take the value of the second element in the list `numbers` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), `hcf` is the first element of the list `numbers` in the first tuple of `cases`, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`**
