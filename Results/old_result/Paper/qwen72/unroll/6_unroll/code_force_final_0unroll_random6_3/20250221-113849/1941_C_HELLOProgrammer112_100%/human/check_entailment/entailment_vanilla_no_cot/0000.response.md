Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then subtracts the count of "mapie". This approach does not account for the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings and ensure the string does not contain them.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and calculate the minimum number of deletions required to remove these substrings. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the minimum deletions required
        min_deletions = 0
        
        # Use a flag to track if we are in the middle of a "map" or "pie" substring
        in_map = False
        in_pie = False
        
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if s[i:i+3] == "map":
                if in_pie:
                    min_deletions += 1
                    in_pie = False
                in_map = True
                i += 3
            elif s[i:i+3] == "pie":
                if in_map:
                    min_deletions += 1
                    in_map = False
                in_pie = True
                i += 3
            else:
                if in_map and s[i] == 'p':
                    min_deletions += 1
                    in_map = False
                elif in_pie and s[i] == 'm':
                    min_deletions += 1
                    in_pie = False
                i += 1
        
        # If we are still in a "map" or "pie" substring at the end, we need to delete one more character
        if in_map or in_pie:
            min_deletions += 1
        
        print(min_deletions)

func()
```

This version of the program correctly identifies the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by tracking the presence of "map" and "pie" substrings and ensuring that overlapping substrings are handled appropriately.
