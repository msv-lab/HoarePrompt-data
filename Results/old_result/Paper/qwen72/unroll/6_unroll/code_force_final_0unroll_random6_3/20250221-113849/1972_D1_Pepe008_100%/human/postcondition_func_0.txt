The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs calculations to determine the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy a specific condition, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the variable `T` remains unchanged, while `a`, `b`, and `suma` retain their values from the last iteration, and the loop index `t` is equal to `T - 1`.
