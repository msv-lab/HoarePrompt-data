The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are updated by the function `func_3()`. The function `func_3()` returns new values for `n`, `m`, and `x`. The initial constraints that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n are no longer guaranteed to be true after the function is called, unless `func_3()` specifically returns values that satisfy these constraints.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`**.
