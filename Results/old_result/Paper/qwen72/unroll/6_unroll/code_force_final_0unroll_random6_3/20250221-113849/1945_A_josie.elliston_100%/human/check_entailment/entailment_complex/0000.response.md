Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for determining the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as per the rules.
   - If the condition is met, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which is the minimum number of tents required to accommodate them.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts and the result from `func_1`, which gives the total number of tents required.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` and prints the result.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that extroverts are always accommodated in groups of 3, and universals can fill in any remaining spots.
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that introverts are always given their own tents, and the total number of tents is calculated correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where there are no participants (`0 0 0`), returning 0.
   - It also handles cases where it's impossible to accommodate extroverts and universals, such as when there are 1 extrovert and 1 universal (`1 1 1`), returning -1.
   - The program correctly handles large inputs up to \(10^9\).

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `1 2 3`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the test case `1 4 1`, the program correctly returns -1.
   - For the test case `1 4 2`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the test case `1 1 1`, the program correctly returns -1.
   - For the test case `1 3 2`, the program correctly returns 3.
   - For the test case `19 7 18`, the program correctly returns 28.
   - For the test case `0 0 0`, the program correctly returns 0.
   - For the test case `7 0 0`, the program correctly returns 7.
   - For the test case `0 24 0`, the program correctly returns 8.
   - For the test case `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the program correctly returns 1666666667.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
