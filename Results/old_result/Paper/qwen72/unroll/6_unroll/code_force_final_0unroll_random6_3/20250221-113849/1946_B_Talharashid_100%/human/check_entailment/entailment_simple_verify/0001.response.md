### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can keep adding it to the array to maximize the sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero (an empty subarray) to the array, which does not change the sum.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - It iterates through the array and keeps track of the current sum `c` and the maximum sum `maxi`.
   - If the current element is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, it resets `c` to zero.
   - Otherwise, it adds the current element to `c` and updates `maxi` if `c` is greater than `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it ensures `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final sum using the formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the maximum sum `maxi` can be added to the array \(2^k - 1\) times (since the first addition is already included in the initial sum).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array contains only negative numbers by setting `maxi` to zero if no positive subarray sum is found.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty by defaulting `maxi` to zero.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Sliding Window Approach:**
  - The sliding window approach is correctly implemented to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
  - The variable `c` is used to keep track of the current sum of the subarray, and `maxi` is used to store the maximum sum found so far.
  - The condition `if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele)` ensures that if the current element is negative and the current sum is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, the current sum `c` is reset to zero. This is a valid approach to avoid negative contributions to the subarray sum.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - The formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is derived correctly.
  - The term \(2^k \times \text{maxi}\) represents the sum of the maximum subarray added \(2^k - 1\) times.
  - Subtracting `maxi` once is necessary to avoid double-counting the initial maximum subarray sum.
  - Adding `sum(l)` ensures that the initial sum of the array is included in the final result.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the array contains only negative numbers, `maxi` will be zero, and the final result will be the sum of the array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - If the array is empty, the program will correctly handle it by setting `maxi` to zero and the final result to zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final:
**True**
