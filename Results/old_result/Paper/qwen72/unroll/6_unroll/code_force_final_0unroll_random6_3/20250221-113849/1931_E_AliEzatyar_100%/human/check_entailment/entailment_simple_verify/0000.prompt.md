You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the reversal of digits for Anna's turn correctly. The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros, but the program does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros can be used to determine the winner, but this does not account for the actual values of the numbers and the optimal play strategy.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description, Anna can reverse the digits of either 14 or 2. If she reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins. However, if Anna reverses 2 to 2 (which remains the same), Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is also greater than \(10^2 = 100\). So, Sasha wins in both cases. The program, however, does not correctly simulate this scenario and may produce incorrect results.

Another example:
```
1
3 5
9 56 1
```
Anna can reverse 9 to 9, 56 to 65, or 1 to 1. If Anna reverses 56 to 65, Sasha can concatenate 65 and 9 to get 659, and then concatenate 659 and 1 to get 6591, which is greater than \(10^5 = 100000\). Therefore, Sasha wins. The program does not correctly handle this scenario either.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and thus it is incorrect.
