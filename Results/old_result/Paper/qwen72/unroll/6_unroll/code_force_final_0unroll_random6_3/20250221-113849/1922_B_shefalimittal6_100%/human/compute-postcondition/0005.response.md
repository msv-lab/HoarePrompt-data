Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is an empty list, The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, the number of sticks `n` and a list of integers `a` representing the exponents of the stick lengths. The inputs should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with the additional constraint that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5. The `input` function is now set to read from `sys.stdin`. `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
