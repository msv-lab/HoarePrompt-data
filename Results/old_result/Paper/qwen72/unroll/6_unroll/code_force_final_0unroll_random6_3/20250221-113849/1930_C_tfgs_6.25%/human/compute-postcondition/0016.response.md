The function `func_1` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the list. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.**
