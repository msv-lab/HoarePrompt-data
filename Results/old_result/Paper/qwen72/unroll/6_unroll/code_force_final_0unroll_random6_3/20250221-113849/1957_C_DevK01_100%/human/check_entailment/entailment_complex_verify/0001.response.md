### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the remaining valid positions for rooks.
   - This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the row `a` and column `b` are occupied by a white rook, and the computer's mirrored move occupies the row `b` and column `a`.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one row and one column are occupied.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of different final configurations.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on the remaining `n` positions.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with `[1, 1]` to handle the base cases:
     - `dp[0] = 1` represents the case where there are no rooks, which has exactly one configuration (an empty board).
     - `dp[1] = 1` represents the case where there is one rook, which also has exactly one configuration (one rook on the board).
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates the `dp` array using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula is correct and accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current configuration, considering the previous configurations:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in a configuration with `i-1` positions.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place a rook in a new row and column, considering the previous configurations with `i-2` positions.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of different final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This part of the program is also accurate and follows the problem description.

### Validation of Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points:
  - Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
  - Inside the function `func_1`, the `dp` array is updated correctly, and only the last two computed values are stored.
  - The function returns the last computed value of the sequence, which is the first element of the `dp` list.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input, processes the moves, and uses dynamic programming to compute the number of valid final configurations. The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
