### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of length `n-1`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.

3. **First Element:**
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_2 % a_1 = arr[0]` because `a_2` will be `arr[0] + a_1`.

4. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - For each subsequent element `i` from 1 to `n-2`, the program sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
   - It then checks if `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`. If it is, it repeatedly adds `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = arr[i + 1]`.

5. **Last Element:**
   - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that `a_n % a_{n-1} = arr[-1]`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `ans` for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **First Element:**
  - The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This is correct because `a_2 % a_1 = arr[0]` will hold true since `a_2 = arr[0] + a_1`.

- **Subsequent Elements:**
  - The loop `for i in range(n - 2):` correctly iterates through the elements from 1 to `n-2`.
  - The assignment `ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]` ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is at least `arr[i]` and is a multiple of `ans[i]` plus `arr[i]`.
  - The condition `if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:` and the while loop `while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]: ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is adjusted to be greater than `arr[i + 1]` and still satisfies the modulo condition. This is necessary because `a_{i+2} % a_{i+1} = arr[i + 1]` must hold true.

- **Last Element:**
  - The last element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This is correct because `a_n % a_{n-1} = arr[-1]` will hold true since `a_n = a_{n-1} + arr[-1]`.

### Validation with Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `arr` is a list of integers where `1 <= arr[i] <= 500` for all `1 <= i < n`, and `n` is an integer such that `2 <= n <= 500`.
  - This is consistent with the problem constraints.

- **State After Function Call:**
  - `ans` is a list of `n` elements where:
    - `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.
    - For each `1 <= i < n-1`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be obtained by repeatedly adding `ans[i-1]` to `arr[i-1]`.
    - The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. The logic ensures that for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `ans[i] % ans[i-1] = arr[i-1]`. The while loop in the function `func_1` ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, which is necessary to satisfy the modulo condition.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
