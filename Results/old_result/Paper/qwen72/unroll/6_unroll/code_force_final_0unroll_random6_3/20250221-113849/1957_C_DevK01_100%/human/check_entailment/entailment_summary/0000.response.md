Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) initial moves, where the computer mirrors the player's moves. The key points to evaluate are:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard \( n \) and the number of initial moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) initial moves and processes them to determine the remaining available positions on the board.

2. **Processing Initial Moves**:
   - For each initial move \((a, b)\), if \( a \neq b \), the program correctly reduces the available positions by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's mirrored move).
   - If \( a = b \), the program correctly reduces the available positions by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the number of different final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, as it efficiently calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions.
   - The formula used in the dynamic programming step is:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]
     \]
     This formula correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks on the board, considering the constraints of the problem.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to handle the input and compute the final configurations correctly. The dynamic programming approach and the logic for processing initial moves are sound and align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
