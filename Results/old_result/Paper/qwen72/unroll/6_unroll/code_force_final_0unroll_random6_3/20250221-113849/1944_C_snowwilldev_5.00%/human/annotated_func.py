#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of the array a, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and it is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the smallest index i such that the element a[i] appears exactly once in the array a, or the smallest index i such that the element i is not present in the array a, and then breaks out of the loop. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the smallest index `i` such that the element `a[i]` appears exactly once in the array `a`, or the smallest index `i` such that the element `i` is not present in the array `a`, and then breaks out of the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` are updated for each test case, but their final states are not predictable without the specific input values.
