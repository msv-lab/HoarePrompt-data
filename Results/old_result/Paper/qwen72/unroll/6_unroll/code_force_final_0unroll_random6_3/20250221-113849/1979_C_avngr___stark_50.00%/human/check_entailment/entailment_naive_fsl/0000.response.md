Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the bets for each outcome is flawed. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all multipliers `k[i]`. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which can cause overflow or performance issues.

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - The program calculates `c[i]` as `m / k[i]` for each outcome. This approach is not optimal and can lead to incorrect results, especially when the multipliers are not relatively prime.

3. **Calculation of `hcf`**:
   - The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the `c` values and then divides each `c[i]` by this HCF. This step is intended to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values, but it can still lead to incorrect results if the initial `c` values are not correctly calculated.

4. **Check for sum of bets**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If it is, the program prints `-1`, indicating that no solution exists. However, this check is not always accurate.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
The program will calculate:
- `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`
- `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
- `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
- `c = [14, 21, 6]`
- `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`

The program will then check if `sum(c) >= m / hcf`, which is `41 >= 42 / 1`, and since this is false, it will print the bets `[14, 21, 6]`.

However, the correct bets should be `[27, 41, 12]` as shown in the example output. The program fails to find the correct distribution of bets that ensures the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve solving the system of inequalities:
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_1 * x_1`
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_2 * x_2`
- ...
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < k_n * x_n`

This can be simplified to:
- `x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n < x_1 * (k_1 - 1) + x_2 * (k_2 - 1) + ... + x_n * (k_n - 1)`

One way to solve this is to set `x_i = 1` for all `i` and then adjust the values to ensure the total sum is strictly less than the required amount. This can be done by finding the minimum value of `x_i` that satisfies all the inequalities.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases and can produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
