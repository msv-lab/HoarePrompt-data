You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it constructs an array `ans` of length `n` where the elements are powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of `k`. If the number of 1s in `k` is less than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are set to 0. The function prints the array `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Bitwise Analysis:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the bits of `k` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).
   - If the current bit is set to 1 (i.e., `k & 1 == 1`), it appends the position `i` to `arr`.
   - It then right shifts `k` by 1 bit (`k = k >> 1`) and increments `i` by 1.

3. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the resulting sequence.
   - It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the number of elements added to `ans`.
   - The program iterates through the positions stored in `arr`.
   - For each position `i`, it appends `1 << i` to `ans` (which is the integer with only the `i`-th bit set to 1).
   - If `c` reaches `n - 1`, it appends the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - If the loop completes before `c` reaches `n - 1`, it appends `0` to `ans` to make the sequence length equal to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by appending the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` when `c` reaches `n - 1`. This is correct because the sum of the sequence before this point is the sum of powers of 2, which is less than or equal to `k`.

- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
  - The program constructs the sequence by setting the bits that are set in `k` to 1 in the sequence. This is the optimal way to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - By using `1 << i`, it ensures that each bit position that is set in `k` is represented exactly once in the sequence, which maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result.

- **Handling Edge Cases:**
  - If `n` is 1, the program will output `k` directly, which is correct.
  - If `k` is 0, the program will output a sequence of `n` zeros, which is correct because the sum of zeros is 0 and the OR of zeros is 0 (no 1s in the binary representation).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
