### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a` from the input.
   - The array elements are parsed correctly using a list comprehension that checks if each element is a digit. This ensures that only valid integers are included in the list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
   - The function is used to determine if the array is already in a state where the beauty is zero (since no rearrangement can increase the beauty).

3. **Beauty Calculation:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the program prints `0` because the array is already sorted and the beauty cannot be increased.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of `(b[x] - b[x - 1])` for all `x` from 1 to `num2 - 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
- The maximum beauty is indeed achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, and the sum of these differences is maximized.
- The function `func_1` is not strictly necessary for the solution. It checks if the array is already sorted, but even if the array is sorted, the beauty calculation will still be correct and will yield `0` for a sorted array with all elements equal.
- However, the function `func_1` does not affect the correctness of the program. It simply optimizes the output for already sorted arrays, which is a valid optimization.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- The sorting of the array and the calculation of the beauty are correct.
- The function `func_1` is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described. The function `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code, but its presence does not impact the correctness of the solution.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
