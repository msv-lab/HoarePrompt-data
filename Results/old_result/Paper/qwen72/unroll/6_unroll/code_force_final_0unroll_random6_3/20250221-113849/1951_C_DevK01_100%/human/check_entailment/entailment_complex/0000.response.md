### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Limiting `m` to `k`:**
   - The line `m = min(m, k)` ensures that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed `k`.
   - This is a necessary step to avoid buying more tickets than required in a single day.

3. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The variable `q` is calculated as `math.ceil(k / m)`, which determines the minimum number of days required to buy `k` tickets, given that we can buy at most `m` tickets per day.
   - This is correct and follows the logic of the problem.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.
   - This ensures that we are buying tickets on the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy exactly `k` tickets by purchasing `m` tickets each day on the selected `q` days.
     - The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, which accounts for the initial cost of buying `m` tickets each day and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means we need to buy a different number of tickets on the last day.
     - The function pops the last element from `N` (the most expensive day) and calculates the cost for the remaining days.
     - The cost for the last day is calculated as `mu * w`, where `mu` is the number of tickets left to buy on the last day and `w` is the price on that day.
     - The total cost is then updated to include the cost of the remaining days and the additional price increase.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total cost for each test case.
   - The `continue` statement is unnecessary and can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
The program follows the logic described in the problem and correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy exactly `k` tickets. The steps are well-structured, and the calculations account for the price increases and the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day.

**Correctness: True**
