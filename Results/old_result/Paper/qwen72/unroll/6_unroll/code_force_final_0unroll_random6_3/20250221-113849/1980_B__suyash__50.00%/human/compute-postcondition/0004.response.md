Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads input values `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. It then determines if Dmitry's favorite cube (index `f-1`) can remain in the list after removing `k` cubes. The function prints 'YES' if the favorite cube can definitely remain, 'NO' if it cannot, and 'MAYBE' if it might remain depending on the specific cubes removed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be in their final state as determined by the last test case's input. **
