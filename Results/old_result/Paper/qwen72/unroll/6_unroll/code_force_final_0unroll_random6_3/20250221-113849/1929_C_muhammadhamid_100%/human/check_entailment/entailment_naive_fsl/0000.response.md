Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the value of `s` is flawed. The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins required to guarantee a win by summing up a sequence, but it does not correctly account for the exponential growth of the required coins when considering the maximum number of consecutive losses.

For example, consider the test case `k = 2, x = 1, a = 1`:
- According to the problem, Sasha can only place a bet of 1 coin. If he loses, he cannot place any more bets, and thus he cannot guarantee having any number of coins greater than 1.
- However, the program calculates `s` as follows:
  - `s = 1`
  - `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` which becomes `s += 1 // 1 + 1` or `s += 2`
  - `s` becomes `3`
- The program then checks if `a >= s` and prints `No` because `1 < 3`.

This is incorrect because Sasha can only place a bet of 1 coin, and if he loses, he cannot place any more bets. Therefore, the correct output should be `No` for this case, but the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario.

Another example is `k = 2, x = 3, a = 15`:
- The program calculates `s` as follows:
  - `s = 1`
  - `s += 1 // 1 + 1` which becomes `s += 2` (s = 3)
  - `s += 3 // 1 + 1` which becomes `s += 4` (s = 7)
  - `s += 7 // 1 + 1` which becomes `s += 8` (s = 15)
- The program then checks if `a >= s` and prints `Yes` because `15 == 15`.

However, the correct logic should consider that Sasha can place bets in such a way that he can recover from up to `x` consecutive losses. The program does not correctly account for this, and thus it may produce incorrect results for some cases.
