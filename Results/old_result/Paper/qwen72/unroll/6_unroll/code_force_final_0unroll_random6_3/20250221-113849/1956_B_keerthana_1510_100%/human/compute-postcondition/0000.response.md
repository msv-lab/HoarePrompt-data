The only objects in the loop head are `line` and the list generated by `[*open(0)][2::2]`. To ensure the loop can execute, the list must contain at least one element. The list is generated by slicing the result of `[*open(0)]` starting from the third element and taking every second element thereafter. This means the file being read must have at least three lines for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the function parameters and the problem description, the file being read should contain the input for the function, which includes the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case. For the loop to execute, the file must have at least three lines, with the first line being the number of test cases, and each subsequent pair of lines representing a test case.

State: **The file being read must have at least three lines, `line` is the first line of the first test case, which is the third line in the file.**
