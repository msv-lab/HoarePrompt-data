### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`**:
   - The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is necessary to simulate the insertion of `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Counting Unique Elements**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the unique elements in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Array `b`**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array `b`.
   - It iterates over the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - For each unique element, it checks if there are any gaps between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list. If there are gaps, it fills them with the largest possible values that are not already in `ans`, ensuring the lexicographically largest order.
   - It also ensures that the final length of `ans` is `n` by appending additional elements if necessary.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which should be the lexicographically largest array `b`.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Step 1**: Reading input and handling multiple test cases is correctly implemented.
- **Step 2**: Modifying the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element is correct.
- **Step 3**: Using a `Counter` to count frequencies and converting `a` to a set to remove duplicates is correct.
- **Step 4**: Sorting the unique elements in descending order and constructing the array `b` by filling gaps and ensuring the final length is `n` is correct. The logic for filling gaps and appending additional elements is correctly implemented to ensure the lexicographically largest order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and produces the lexicographically largest array `b` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
