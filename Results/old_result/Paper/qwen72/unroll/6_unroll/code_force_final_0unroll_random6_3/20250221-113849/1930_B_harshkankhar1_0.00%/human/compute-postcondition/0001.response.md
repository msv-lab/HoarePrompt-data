The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses the elements at the even indices of the list `a`. 

Let's break it down:
- `a[::2]` selects every second element starting from index 0 (i.e., the even indices).
- `a[::2][::-1]` reverses the selected elements.
- The reversed elements are then assigned back to the even indices of `a`.

For example, if `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, the even indices are `[1, 3, 5]`, and the elements at these indices are `[1, 3, 5]`. Reversing these elements gives `[5, 3, 1]`, which are then assigned back to the even indices, resulting in `a = [5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6]`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, where the elements at even indices have been reversed, `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.**
