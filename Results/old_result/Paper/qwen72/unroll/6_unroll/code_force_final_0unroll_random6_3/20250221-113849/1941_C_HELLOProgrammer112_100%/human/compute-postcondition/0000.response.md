The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that the input is valid and within the specified range.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0 and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
