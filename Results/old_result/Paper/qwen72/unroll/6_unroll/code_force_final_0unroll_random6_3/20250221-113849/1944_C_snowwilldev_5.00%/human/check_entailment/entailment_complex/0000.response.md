### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N-1` to find the smallest index `i` such that:
     - The element `i` appears exactly once in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 1`), and Alice can choose it.
     - Or, the element `i` does not appear in `a` at all (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), and Bob can ensure that Alice cannot choose it.
   - If either condition is met, the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that appears exactly once in `a` to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob will try to remove the smallest element that appears exactly once in `a` to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - If no element appears exactly once, the MEX of `c` will be the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `a`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `a` using `defaultdict`.
   - The loop iterates through the range from 0 to `N-1` to find the smallest `i` that meets the conditions.
   - The condition `if cnt[i] == 1` ensures that Alice can pick the element if it appears exactly once.
   - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` ensures that the loop breaks if either:
     - Alice has picked two elements that appear exactly once (which is not possible in this game as Bob will always remove the second one).
     - The element `i` does not appear in `a` at all.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same (e.g., `a = [1, 1]`), correctly printing `0` as the MEX.
   - It also handles the case where `a` contains all unique elements (e.g., `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`), correctly printing `1` as the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles multiple test cases and prints the correct result for each case.

### Correctness:
**True**
