### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x` and return it plus one. If no such element exists, it returns -1.
   - The use of `bisect_left` is appropriate for finding the insertion point, but the function should return `inx` directly if `a[inx]` is not equal to `x` and `inx` is within bounds. The current implementation is correct in this regard.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.
   - **Initialization**:
     - `left` is initialized to `[0]` and `last` to `[-1]`. These lists are used to keep track of cumulative sums and the last occurrence of a different value, respectively.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
     - The loop `for i in a: left.append(left[-1] + i)` correctly calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in `a`.
   - **Tracking Last Occurrence**:
     - The loop `for i in range(1, n): if a[i] != a[i - 1]: last.append(i) else: last.append(last[-1])` correctly updates the `last` list to track the last occurrence of a different value.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` processes each slime to determine if it can be eaten.
     - If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, the slime `i` is immediately eaten by the previous slime, and `ans[i]` is set to 1.
     - For `a[i] >= a[i - 1]`, the program calculates `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1` to find the cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes that can potentially eat the current slime.
     - It then uses `func_1` to find the index of the first cumulative sum that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - The `last` list is used to ensure that the slime being considered is the last one of its size before a different size appears.
     - The minimum of `inx` and `last[i - 1]` is used to update `ans[i]` to the minimum number of seconds it takes for the slime to be eaten.
     - If `inx` is negative, it means no such slime exists, and the loop continues.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The main loop calls `func_2` twice, once for the original list `a` and once for the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - The results are combined by taking the minimum of the two values for each slime, ensuring that the minimum number of seconds is reported.
   - If one of the values is -1, it means the slime cannot be eaten from that direction, and the other value is used.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct as per the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the input, processes the slimes to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each to be eaten, and combines the results from both directions. The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem description and constraints.
