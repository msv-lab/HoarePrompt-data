You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n and q are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5, operations is a list of n lists where each inner list contains two integers b and x (b ∈ {1, 2}, 1 <= x <= n for b=1, 1 <= x <= 10^9 for b=2), and queries is a list of q integers where each integer k_i satisfies 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c) and c is the size of the array after all operations.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the variables `n` and `q` have been updated with new values from the input, `operations` has been updated with a new list of `n` operations, and `queries` has been updated with a new list of `q` queries. The `result` variable has been updated with the output of `func_1(n, operations, queries)` for each iteration, and the results have been printed. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` is reset for each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes the operations and queries to return a list of results based on the operations performed and the queries asked.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
