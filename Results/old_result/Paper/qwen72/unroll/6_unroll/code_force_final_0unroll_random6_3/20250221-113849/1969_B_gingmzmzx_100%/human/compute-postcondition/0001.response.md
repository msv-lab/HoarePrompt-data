The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of the list of binary strings and the conditions on the strings themselves do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
