### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total bet is `sum(x_i)` and it must be less than `k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Approach in the Program:**
   - The program calculates the product of all `k_i` values and uses it to determine the bets.
   - It then calculates the bets as `m / k_i` for each outcome.
   - The program finds the highest common factor (HCF) of these bets and normalizes them by dividing by the HCF.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Analysis of the Program:**
   - **Product Calculation:**
     - The product `m` of all `k_i` values is calculated. This ensures that each `x_i` is a multiple of the product of the other `k_j` values.
   - **Bet Calculation:**
     - The bets are calculated as `m / k_i`. This ensures that the return for the i-th outcome is `k_i * (m / k_i) = m`, which is the same for all outcomes.
   - **HCF Calculation:**
     - The HCF of the bets is calculated to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the same ratios.
   - **Sum Check:**
     - The program checks if the sum of the normalized bets is less than `m / hcf`. This is crucial because if the sum is greater or equal to `m / hcf`, the total bet will not be strictly less than the return for any outcome.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach ensures that the return for any winning outcome is `m`, which is the same for all outcomes.
   - The HCF normalization reduces the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the required condition.
   - The sum check ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any outcome.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Product Calculation:**
     - The product `m` can become very large, especially for large `n` and `k_i` values. However, the program uses the HCF to reduce the bets, which should handle this issue.
   - **HCF Calculation:**
     - The HCF calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are minimized while maintaining the required ratios.
   - **Sum Check:**
     - The sum check is crucial and correctly implemented. If the sum of the normalized bets is not less than `m / hcf`, the program correctly prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `-1` because there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return.
   - For `n = 2` and `k_1 = k_2`, the program correctly prints `-1` because the sum of the bets would be equal to the return.
   - For larger `n` and different `k_i` values, the program should work as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
