Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. Specifically, it only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and increments the answer by 1 if found, but it does not account for overlapping occurrences or the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.

For example, consider the input string "ppiepieeee". The program will output 2, but the correct answer should be 3. Here's why:

- The program will find "pie" at positions 1-3 and increment `ans` by 1.
- It will then find "pie" at positions 4-6 and increment `ans` by 1.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we need to remove at least 3 characters to eliminate both "pie" substrings.

The correct approach should consider the minimum deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string, including overlapping cases.
