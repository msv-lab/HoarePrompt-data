Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Loop Condition**: The loop `for i in range(n * 2):` is incorrect. The loop should run exactly `n` times, not `2n` times. Each iteration of the loop should process a pair of numbers, and since there are `2n` numbers, you only need `n` iterations.

2. **Incorrect List Manipulation**: The way the list is being manipulated is incorrect. The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`, which will not remove the correct elements. Instead, it should remove the first two elements of the list in each iteration.

3. **Sorting the List**: To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest two numbers together. This can be achieved by sorting the list and then summing the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements will be the minimum values in each pair).

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input().strip()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads the list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and then sums the first `n` elements.
3. **Output**: The program appends the result to a list `ans_f` and prints the results for all test cases at the end.

This corrected program will correctly compute the maximum final score for each test case.
