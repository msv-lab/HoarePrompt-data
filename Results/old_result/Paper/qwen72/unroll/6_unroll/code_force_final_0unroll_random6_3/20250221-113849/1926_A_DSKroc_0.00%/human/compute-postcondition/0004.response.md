Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, inclusive.
   - `ac` and `bc` are both initially 0.
   - The function `func` has read `t` lines from stdin, each containing a distinct string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'.
   - The current value of `ac` is greater than the current value of `bc`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('A')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string 'A'.
   - The values of `t`, `ac`, and `bc` do not affect the output of this `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.
   - The condition that `ac` is greater than `bc` is also irrelevant to the output of the `print` statement.

Given this, the output of the `print` statement is straightforward:

Output: **A**
