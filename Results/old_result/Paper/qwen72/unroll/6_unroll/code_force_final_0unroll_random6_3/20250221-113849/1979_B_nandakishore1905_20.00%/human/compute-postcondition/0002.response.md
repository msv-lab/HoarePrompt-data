The function `func` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters, so it is assumed that they are missing. Given the constraints and relationships, the function should return a value based on the inputs `x` and `y`, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. 

To provide a complete description, I will assume the function signature should include `x` and `y` as parameters. If the function is supposed to return a value based on these inputs, the functionality would be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x ≠ y. The function returns a value based on the inputs `x` and `y`, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.**
