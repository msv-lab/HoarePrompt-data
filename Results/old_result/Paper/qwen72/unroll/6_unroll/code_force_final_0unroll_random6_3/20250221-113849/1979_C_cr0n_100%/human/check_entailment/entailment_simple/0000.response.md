### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`.
   - The function is used to find the LCM of all elements in `vals`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function calculates the LCM of all elements in `vals` and stores it in `den`.
   - It then calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `den // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - The program checks if the sum of `vprod` is greater than or equal to `den`. If so, it prints `-1` because it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any outcome.
   - If the sum of `vprod` is less than `den`, it prints the elements of `vprod` as the bets for each outcome.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a common multiple of all multipliers.
   - The list `vprod` is calculated by dividing `den` by each multiplier, which ensures that the return for each outcome is a multiple of the corresponding multiplier.
   - The check `if (den <= 0)` is incorrect because `den` is the LCM minus the sum of `vprod`, and the LCM is always positive. The correct check should be `if (sum(vprod) >= den)` to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the return for any outcome.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where a valid distribution is possible by printing the bets.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but there is a logical error in the check condition. The correct condition should be `if (sum(vprod) >= den)` instead of `if (den <= 0)`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
