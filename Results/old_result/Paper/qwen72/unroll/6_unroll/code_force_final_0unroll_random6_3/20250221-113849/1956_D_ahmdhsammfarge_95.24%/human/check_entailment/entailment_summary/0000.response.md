Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing operations that replace a segment of the array with the MEX of that segment.
   - The MEX of a segment is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment.
   - The operations are limited to no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is designed to find the optimal segment `[r, l]` to replace in order to maximize the sum of the array. It iterates over all possible segments and calculates the potential new sum if the segment is replaced with its MEX. The segment that results in the highest sum is returned.
   - **func_2**: This function is recursive and appends operations to the `ops` list. It seems to be designed to ensure that the segment `[r, l]` is processed multiple times, but its exact purpose and correctness in the context of the problem are not immediately clear.
   - **func_3**: This function performs the actual replacement of the segment `[r, l]` with the MEX of the segment. It also appends several operations to the `ops` list, including an additional operation if the minimum value in the segment is 0. The segment is then set to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the segment.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - The main program initializes the list `lst` and an empty list `ops`.
   - It calls `func_1` to find the initial optimal segment `[r, l]`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `r` equals `l`, calling `func_3` to perform the replacement and update the `ops` list.
   - After the loop, it tries to replace any remaining 0s in the list with 1s, appending the corresponding operations to `ops`.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the modified list and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - **func_1**: The function correctly identifies the segment that, when replaced with its MEX, maximizes the sum of the array. However, it does not compute the MEX directly; instead, it assumes that the MEX of a segment `[r, l]` is `l - r + 1` (the length of the segment), which is not always correct. The MEX of a segment is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the segment, not necessarily the length of the segment.
   - **func_2**: This function is not used in the main program. It is designed to append operations recursively, but its purpose in the context of the problem is unclear. It does not seem to contribute to the correct solution.
   - **func_3**: The function correctly appends operations to `ops` and updates the segment `[r, l]` with the MEX value. However, it also appends additional operations that are not necessary for the problem's solution, such as the operation `[r + 1, r + 1]` and the recursive call to `func_2`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the segments.
   - The use of `func_2` and the additional operations in `func_3` are unnecessary and may lead to incorrect or suboptimal solutions.
   - The program does not meet the problem description because it does not correctly maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

Correctness: **False**
