The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which likely represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The function's output is not explicitly described, but it can be inferred that the function processes these parameters in some way and returns a result for each test case. Since the specific output is not provided, we can only describe the parameters and the general nature of the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` (integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9). The function processes these parameters and returns a result for each test case.**
