### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then iterates over the list to process each test case. The variable `idx` is used to keep track of the current position in the list `data`.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each exponent `a_i`.
   - It then reads the exponents `a_i` and increments the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Triangle Formation Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.
   - It uses the fact that for three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - The program counts the number of valid combinations by iterating through the list `v` and using the following logic:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and pairs them with any stick of a different length.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end, one result per line.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Correctness of Triangle Formation**:
  - The logic for counting the number of ways to form a triangle is correct. For a non-degenerate triangle with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) (where \(a_i \le a_j \le a_k\)), the condition \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\) must hold. This is equivalent to \(a_i + a_j > a_k\), which is always true if \(a_i = a_j = a_k\) (since \(2a_i > a_i\)) or if there are at least two sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length.
  - The program correctly handles these cases by counting the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 sticks of the same length and pairing them appropriately.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by returning 0.
  - It also handles the case where all sticks have different lengths and no valid triangle can be formed.

- **Input and Output**:
  - The input handling is correct and follows the problem's constraints.
  - The output is correctly formatted, with each result printed on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the specified cases and constraints correctly.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
