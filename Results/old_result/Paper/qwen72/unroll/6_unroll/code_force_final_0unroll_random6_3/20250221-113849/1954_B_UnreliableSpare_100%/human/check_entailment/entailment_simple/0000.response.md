Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1` is called without passing any parameters, which is inconsistent with the expected function signature described in the comments.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same**: The program checks if all elements in the array are the same using a `flag` variable. If all elements are the same, it sets `flag` to `True`. This is a valid check for the first condition of the problem, where if all elements are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Consecutive Elements to Remove**: The program then attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`val`) and store this in `ans`. The idea is to find the smallest sequence of consecutive elements that, if removed, would prevent the array from being beautiful. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers sequences of elements that are the same as the first element, and it does not consider other sequences that might be shorter and could also make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Output**: The program outputs `-1` if all elements are the same, which is correct. If not, it outputs the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This is incorrect because it does not account for other possible sequences that could be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the array has only one element, it should output `-1` because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful. The program does not explicitly handle this case, but it might work correctly due to the `flag` check.

6. **General Approach**: The general approach of finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is not robust. The program should consider all possible sequences of elements that can be removed, not just those that are the same as the first element.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
