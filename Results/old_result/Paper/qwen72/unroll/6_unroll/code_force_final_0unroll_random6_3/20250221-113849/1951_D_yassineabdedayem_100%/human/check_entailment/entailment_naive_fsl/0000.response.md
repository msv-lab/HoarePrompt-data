Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when `n` is significantly larger than `k` but still within the constraints. For example, consider the case where `n = 1000` and `k = 10`. According to the problem description, Bob should be able to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly 10 jewels. However, the program will output "NO" for this case, which is incorrect.

Here's why:
- The program checks if `n == k` and if `n + 2 > k * 2`.
- For `n = 1000` and `k = 10`, `n + 2` is 1002, and `k * 2` is 20. Since 1002 > 20, the program will output "YES" and set up 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- However, this setup is not correct because Alice will buy more than 10 jewels if the prices are set this way. For example, with prices 991 and 1, Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 999 jewels from the second stall, which is not equal to 10.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
