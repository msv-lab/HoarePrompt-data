Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `a`. This is done using the `lcm` function, which iteratively computes the LCM of the list of numbers. The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Betting Strategy**: The program then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by each multiplier. This ensures that the return for each outcome is a multiple of the LCM, which is a common multiple of all multipliers.

4. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of all bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the bets are valid, and the program prints them. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution of bets exists.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly formats the output as a space-separated list of integers for each test case.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

- **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the return for each outcome is a multiple of the LCM. This is a key part of ensuring that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.
- **Betting Calculation**: By setting each bet to `prod // a[i]`, the program ensures that the return for the i-th outcome is `a[i] * (prod // a[i]) = prod`, which is the same for all outcomes.
- **Sum Check**: The sum of all bets is checked against the LCM. If the sum is less than the LCM, the bets are valid. Otherwise, the program outputs `-1`.

Given the constraints and the problem requirements, this approach is valid and will produce the correct output for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
