The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) representing the length of the string s, and the second line contains the string s consisting of characters '+' and '-' (|s| = n). The function should output the minimum possible penalty for each test case to stdout.
