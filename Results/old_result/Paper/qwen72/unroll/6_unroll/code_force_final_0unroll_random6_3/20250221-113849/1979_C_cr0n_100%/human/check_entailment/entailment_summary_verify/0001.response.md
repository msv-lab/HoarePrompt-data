### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the `i`-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount of coins bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.

2. **Approach**:
   - The program uses the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to determine the bets.
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is calculated using the `func_1` function, which computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - The LCM is then divided by each `k_i` to get the bet amounts `vprod[i]`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `den - sum(vprod)`, where `den` is the LCM.
   - If the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome, the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. This is correct.
   - **`func_2()`**: This function processes each test case.
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
     - It initializes `den` to the first multiplier.
     - It iterates through the multipliers, updating `den` to the LCM of `den` and the current multiplier.
     - It calculates the bet amounts `vprod` by dividing `den` by each multiplier.
     - It checks if the total amount of coins bet (`den - sum(vprod)`) is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.
     - If the condition is not met, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints the bet amounts.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The LCM approach ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount of coins bet is minimized while still meeting the condition.
   - The condition `den - sum(vprod) > 0` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` mentions that it calculates the GCD of the integers in the list, which is incorrect. It actually calculates the LCM of the integers in the list.
   - The function `func_2` does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It only processes one test case and does not loop to handle `t` test cases.

6. **Revised Approach**:
   - To handle multiple test cases, the function `func_2` should be modified to loop `t` times, processing each test case independently.
   - The LCM calculation and bet distribution should be performed within each iteration of the loop.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct. The program's logic for a single test case is correct, but it fails to handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
