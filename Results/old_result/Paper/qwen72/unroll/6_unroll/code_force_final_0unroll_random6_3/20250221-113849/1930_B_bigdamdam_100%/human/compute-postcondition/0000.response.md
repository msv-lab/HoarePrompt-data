The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can refer to as `t` (the number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case is defined by a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5).
- The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is a positive integer and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `i` is 0**
