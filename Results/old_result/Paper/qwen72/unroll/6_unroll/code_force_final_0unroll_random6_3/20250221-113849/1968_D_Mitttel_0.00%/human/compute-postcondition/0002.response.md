Output State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0.**

The variable `steps` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`start_pos`, `score`, and `current_pos`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
