You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values for n, m, k, and d where n is the number of rows, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges, and d is the maximum distance between supports. n, m, k, and d are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The function also reads n rows of m integers each, forming a 2D list rows where each element rows[i][j] represents the depth a_{i,j} of the river cell, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: `total_costs` is a list of integers where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list, starting from the first element up to the element that allows `k` consecutive elements to be summed. The length of `total_costs` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not take any parameters but reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. The function also reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, forming a 2D list `rows` where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth of the river cell. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
