The function `func_2` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, where `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, `k` is the number of bridges, and `d` is the maximum distance between supports. It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, forming a 2D list `rows` where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth of the river cell. The function computes the cost for each row using the function `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`. It calculates the sum of `k` consecutive costs for all possible segments in `costs` and stores these sums in a list `total_costs`. Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`. The function does not return any value.
