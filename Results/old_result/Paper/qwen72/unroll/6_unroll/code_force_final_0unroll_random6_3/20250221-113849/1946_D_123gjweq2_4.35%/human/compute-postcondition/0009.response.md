Output State: **new_arr is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in cur_arr until the bit position specified by bit is 0, xor is 0, and thing1 is -1. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `thing1` is updated to -1, while the other variables (`new_arr`, `xor`, and `bit`) remain unchanged. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is still 1, and `new_arr` still contains integers that are the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr` until the bit position specified by `bit` is 0.
