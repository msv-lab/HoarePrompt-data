Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the integer n and the array a, and then processes the array to distribute its elements into two lists, a and b, based on certain conditions. After processing, it calculates the number of increasing pairs in both lists a and b and prints this number for each test case. The variables a and b are reset to empty lists for each new test case, and the variable s, which counts the increasing pairs, is reset to 0 for each test case.**

In more detail:
- The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged.
- For each test case:
  - The variable `n` is updated to the size of the current array.
  - The variable `lit` is updated to the current array.
  - The lists `a` and `b` are populated with elements from `lit` based on the conditions provided in the loop.
  - The variable `s` is calculated as the sum of increasing pairs in both `a` and `b`.
  - The result `s` is printed for the current test case.
  - The lists `a` and `b` are reset to empty lists for the next test case.
  - The variable `s` is reset to 0 for the next test case.
