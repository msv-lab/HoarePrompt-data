#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `k` of length `n`. For each test case, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 50`, and `2 <= k_i <= 20` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `func` remains undefined, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `a` is modified such that each element is the result of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original elements in `a`. The variable `sumo` is the sum of the modified elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is a space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` and a list of integers `a` from the input. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in `a`, then modifies each element in `a` to be the result of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM. It sums the modified elements in `a` to get `sumo`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints a space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
