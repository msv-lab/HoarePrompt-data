Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The function `func_1` only checks if the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in `c`. However, it does not check if `a` and `b` can both match the same template, which requires that for each position `i`:

1. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template must have that lowercase letter at position `i`.
2. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template can have any uppercase letter at position `i` that is not the lowercase version of `c[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version ensures that:

- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (and `b[i]`).
- If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, at least one of them must be different from `c[i]`.

This logic correctly determines if a template `t` exists that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.
