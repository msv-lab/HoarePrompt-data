### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - This means for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j=1, j \neq i}^{n} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(m\).
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\).
   - The program finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the calculated bets \(c_i\) and divides each \(c_i\) by this GCD to ensure the bets are as small as possible.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the total product divided by the GCD. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product \(m\) of all multipliers \(k_i\) is calculated correctly.
   - **Bet Calculation:** The bets \(c_i\) are calculated as \(\frac{m}{k_i}\), which ensures that the total product \(m\) is divisible by each \(k_i\).
   - **GCD Calculation:** The GCD of all bets \(c_i\) is calculated correctly using the `func_1` function.
   - **Sum Check:** The program checks if the sum of the bets is strictly less than \(\frac{m}{\text{GCD}}\). This is the correct condition to ensure that the total amount of coins bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - **Output:** The program prints the bets if the condition is satisfied, and \(-1\) otherwise.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program calculates the product \(m\) of all multipliers, which can be very large (up to \(20^{50}\)). This might lead to integer overflow or performance issues.
   - However, the program then divides each \(c_i\) by the GCD, which reduces the size of the bets. This ensures that the bets are within the allowed range \(1 \le x_i \le 10^9\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Despite the potential for large intermediate values, the program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of bets or determine that no such distribution exists.
   - The GCD calculation and the sum check are both correct and necessary to ensure the solution meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **True**
