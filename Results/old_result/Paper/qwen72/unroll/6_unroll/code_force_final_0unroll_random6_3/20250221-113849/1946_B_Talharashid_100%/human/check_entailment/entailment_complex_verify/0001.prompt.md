You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You perform exactly k operations on it. In one operation, you select any
contiguous subarray of the array a (possibly empty) and insert the sum of this
subarray anywhere in the array.

Your task is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k such
operations.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Reminder: the remainder of a number x modulo p is the smallest non-negative y
such that there exists an integer q and x = p \cdot q + y .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le
2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a and the number of operations,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test, output a single integer — the maximum sum of the array that can
be obtained after k operations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

In the first test case, it is advantageous to take an empty subarray of the
array twice and insert the sum of the empty subarray (zero) anywhere, then the
sum of the resulting array will be (-4) + (-7) + 0 + 0 = -11 , modulo 10^9 + 7
this is 999\,999\,996 .

In the second test case, it is advantageous to take the sum of the entire
array three times and place it anywhere in the array, then one of the possible
sequences of actions: [2, 2, 8 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12 ] \rightarrow [2, 2,
8, 12, 24 ] \rightarrow [2, 2, 8, 12, 24, 48 ], the sum of the final array is
2 + 2 + 8 + 12 + 24 + 48 = 96 .

In the fourth test case, it is advantageous to take a subarray of the array
consisting of the first three numbers (i.e. consisting of the numbers 4, -2
and 8 ) and insert its sum at the beginning of the array, thereby obtaining
the array [10, 4, -2, 8, -12, 9 ], the sum of this array is 17 .

In the seventh test case, it will always be advantageous for us to take an
empty subarray of the array. In this case, the sum of the resulting array will
not differ from the sum of the original. The answer will be the sum of the
original array, taken modulo — 42 , because (-6 \cdot (10^9 + 7) + 42 =
-6\,000\,000\,000) .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `l` of `n` integers. It calculates the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray of `l` that does not include any negative number which would cause the sum to reset. The function then computes and prints the result of the formula `(2


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and we need to perform `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray and insert its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The maximum possible sum after `k` operations can be achieved by repeatedly adding the maximum possible sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can keep adding it to the array to maximize the sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, the best strategy is to add zero (an empty subarray) to the array, which does not change the sum.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - It iterates through the array and keeps track of the current sum `c` and the maximum sum `maxi`.
   - If the current element is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of the element, it resets `c` to zero.
   - Otherwise, it adds the current element to `c` and updates `maxi` if `c` is greater than `maxi`.
   - After the loop, it ensures `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final sum using the formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod (10^9 + 7)\).
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the maximum sum `maxi` can be added to the array `2^k - 1` times (since the first addition is already included in the initial sum).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array contains only negative numbers by setting `maxi` to zero if no positive subarray sum is found.
   - It also handles the case where the array is empty by defaulting `maxi` to zero.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result is correctly taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure it fits within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
