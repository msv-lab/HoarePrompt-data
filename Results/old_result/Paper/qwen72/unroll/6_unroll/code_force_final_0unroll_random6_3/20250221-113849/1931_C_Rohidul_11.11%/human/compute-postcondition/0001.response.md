Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the value of `ans` is printed, which represents the length of the array after removing the longest prefix and suffix of equal elements. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their initial values for the next test case, and the loop variables `l`, `r`, `st`, and `end` are reset for each test case.**
