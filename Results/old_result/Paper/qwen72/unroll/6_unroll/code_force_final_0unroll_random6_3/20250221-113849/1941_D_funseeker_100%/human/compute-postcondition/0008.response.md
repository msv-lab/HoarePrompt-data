Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by adding or subtracting `r` to the initial value `x` (or any subsequent values in `ans`), and taking the result modulo `n`.
- If 0 is in `ans`, the set `ans` no longer contains the value 0, and now includes the value `n`.
- Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(ans))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Set `ans` Construction**:
   - Start with the initial value `x`.
   - Generate new values by adding or subtracting `r` and taking the result modulo `n`.
   - Add these new values to the set `ans`.
   - Continue this process until all unique values are generated.

2. **Handling 0 in `ans`**:
   - If 0 is in the set `ans`, remove 0 and add `n` to the set.
   - This ensures that if 0 is present, it is replaced by `n`.

3. **Determining the Length of `ans`**:
   - The length of the set `ans` will be the number of unique values it contains.
   - If 0 was replaced by `n`, the set will still contain the same number of unique values, just with `n` instead of 0.

### Final Output:
- The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the number of unique values in the set `ans` after the transformations described in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `r` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the number of unique values in the set `ans`.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of unique values in the set `ans` after the transformations described in the initial state)**
