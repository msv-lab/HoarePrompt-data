The function `find_subarrays` accepts three parameters: `a`, `n`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function returns a list of subarrays of `a` such that each subarray has a length of 2k and contains each integer from 1 to k exactly twice.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers of length 2n, a positive integer `n`, and an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It returns a list of subarrays of `a` where each subarray has a length of 2k and contains each integer from 1 to k exactly twice.**
