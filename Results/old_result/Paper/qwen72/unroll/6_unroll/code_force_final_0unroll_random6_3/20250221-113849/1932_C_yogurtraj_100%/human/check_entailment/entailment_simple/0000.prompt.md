Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

    3 1 4 2
    
    LRRL
    
    5 1

    RLLLRR
    
    1 10000
    
    10000
    
    R

Output

    0 2 4 1 
    0 0 0 0 0 
    0 0 0 4 4 4 
    0 
    
Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the necessary inputs as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the inputs should be provided through standard input or a similar mechanism, and they should consist of multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        t = input()
        
        l = t.count('L')
        
        k = 0
        
        q1 = 0
        
        q2 = 0
        
        if t[-1] == 'L':
            k = a[l - 1] % m
            q1 = l - 2
            q2 = l
        else:
            k = a[l] % m
            q1 = l - 1
            q2 = l + 1
        
        y = [0] * n
        
        y[-1] = k
        
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if t[i] == 'R':
                k = k * a[q2] % m
                q2 += 1
            else:
                k = k * a[q1] % m
                q1 -= 1
            y[i] = k
        
        print(*y)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all the test cases and printed the results. The variables `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values are not retained for the next iteration. The loop completes its execution, and the program ends.
