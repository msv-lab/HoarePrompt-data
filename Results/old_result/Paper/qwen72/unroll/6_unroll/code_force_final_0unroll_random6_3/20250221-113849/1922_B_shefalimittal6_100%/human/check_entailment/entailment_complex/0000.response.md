Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`. It then processes the input by iterating through the list, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases. The variable `idx` is used to keep track of the current position in the list, and it is incremented appropriately after each read.

2. **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, the program reads the number of sticks `n` and the exponents `a` of the stick lengths. It initializes a list `v` to count the occurrences of each exponent.

3. **Counting Valid Triangles**:
   - The program iterates through the exponents and counts the number of ways to choose pairs and triplets of sticks with the same exponent.
   - If there are at least two sticks with the same exponent, it calculates the number of ways to choose two sticks from these and adds it to the total count `ans`.
   - If there are at least three sticks with the same exponent, it calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks from these and adds it to the total count `ans`.
   - The variable `cnt` is used to keep a cumulative count of the sticks processed so far, which is used in the calculation of pairs and triplets.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, one per line, as required.

5. **Constraints**: The program handles the constraints correctly. It processes up to \(10^4\) test cases, and for each test case, it can handle up to \(3 \times 10^5\) sticks. The additional constraint that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \times 10^5\) is also respected.

6. **Correctness of Triangle Formation**:
   - The program correctly identifies that a triangle can only be formed if there are at least two sticks with the same exponent. This is because the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, and the triangle inequality theorem (the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side) can only be satisfied if at least two sticks have the same length.
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose pairs and triplets of sticks with the same exponent, which is the correct approach for this problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
