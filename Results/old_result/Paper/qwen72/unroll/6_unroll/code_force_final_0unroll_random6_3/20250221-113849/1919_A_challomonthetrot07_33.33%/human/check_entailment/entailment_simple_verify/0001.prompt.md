You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of tuples (a, b) as input.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif b == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a > b:

    #State: The loop will execute `T` times, and for each iteration, it will read a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input. Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it will print either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The variables `a` and `b` will be updated with the new input values for each iteration, and the loop will continue until all `T` iterations are completed. After the loop finishes, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and `T` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `T` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `T` times, each time reading two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - **If `a == b`:** This means both players have the same number of coins. Since both players play optimally, they will always end up in a situation where they have to remove the last coin from their wallets simultaneously, and the player who is forced to do this first will lose. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **If `a == 1`:** Alice has only one coin. She must remove this coin on her first turn, leaving her with an empty wallet. Bob will then win because Alice cannot make a move.
   - **If `b == 1`:** Bob has only one coin. Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first turn, leaving Bob with an empty wallet. Bob will then lose because he cannot make a move.
   - **If `a % 2 == 1`:** Alice has an odd number of coins. The game will always end in a situation where the player with the odd number of coins will be forced to make the last move, which will result in a loss. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`:** Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins. Alice can always force Bob to be the one with the odd number of coins, and thus Bob will be forced to make the last move, resulting in a loss. Therefore, Alice wins.
   - **If `a > b`:** Alice has more coins than Bob. If both players have an even number of coins, Alice can always force Bob to be the one with the fewer coins, and thus Bob will be forced to make the last move, resulting in a loss. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **Otherwise:** This covers the case where `a < b` and both have an even number of coins. Alice can always force Bob to be the one with the fewer coins, and thus Bob will be forced to make the last move, resulting in a loss. Therefore, Alice wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where both players have the same number of coins (`a == b`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has only one coin (`a == 1`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Bob has only one coin (`b == 1`), and Alice wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has an odd number of coins (`a % 2 == 1`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`), and Alice wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has more coins than Bob (`a > b`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Bob has more coins than Alice (`a < b`), and Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
