The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: a list of integers `a` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) of length `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and two integers `x` and `y` (1 <= x, y <= 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The function returns a list `results` which contains the count of pairs (i, j) for each test case, where i < j and (arr[i] + arr[j]) is divisible by `x` or `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing a list of integers and two integers `x` and `y`. It returns a list of results, where each result is the count of pairs (i, j) in the list such that i < j and the sum (arr[i] + arr[j]) is divisible by `x` or `y`.**
