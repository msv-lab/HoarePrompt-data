### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given the coordinates of the four corners of a square on a coordinate plane.
   - The sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes.
   - We need to compute the area of the square.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has four lines, each containing the coordinates of a corner of the square.
   - The output should be the area of the square for each test case.

3. **Square Properties**:
   - Since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will be the same and will be equal to the side length of the square.
   - The area of the square is the side length squared.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It then calculates two distances `n` and `x` using the Euclidean distance formula, but since the sides are parallel to the axes, the Euclidean distance formula is not necessary. Instead, we can directly find the side length by taking the absolute difference of the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of adjacent corners.
   - The program then compares `n` and `x` and prints the smaller one.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points, but it does not ensure that these pairs are adjacent corners of the square.
   - The correct approach should be to find the side length by taking the absolute difference of the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
   - The program does not correctly identify the side length of the square, which can lead to incorrect results.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - We should find the side length by taking the absolute difference of the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of any two adjacent corners.
   - The area of the square is then the side length squared.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly identify the side length of the square and may produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
