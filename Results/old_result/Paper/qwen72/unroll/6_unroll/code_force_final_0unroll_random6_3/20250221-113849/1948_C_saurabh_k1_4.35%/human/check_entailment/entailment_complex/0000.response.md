Reasoning:

The provided function is intended to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) on a grid with arrows. However, the function's logic is flawed. The function only checks if the second-to-last character in the string `b` (representing the second row of the grid) is `<`. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. This logic is insufficient to correctly determine the robot's ability to reach the target cell in all cases.

Here are the issues with the function:

1. **Insufficient Check**: The function only checks the second-to-last character in the second row (`b[n - 2]`). This is not enough to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n). The robot's path depends on the arrows in both rows and the sequence of moves it makes.

2. **Missing Path Analysis**: The function does not simulate the robot's movement or analyze the entire grid to check if there is a valid path from (1, 1) to (2, n). It simply makes a decision based on a single character, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Incorrect Assumption**: The assumption that the robot can reach the target cell if `b[n - 2]` is not `<` is not always correct. The robot's movement is influenced by the arrows in both rows, and it must be able to navigate through the grid to reach the target cell.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should simulate the robot's movement through the grid, considering both the initial move and the move along the arrow in each cell. It should check if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) by following the rules of movement.

Given these issues, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
