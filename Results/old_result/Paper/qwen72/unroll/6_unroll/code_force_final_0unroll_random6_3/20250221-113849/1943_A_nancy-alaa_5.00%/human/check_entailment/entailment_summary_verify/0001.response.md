### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to remove elements that would otherwise be included by Alice, especially those that are unique and small.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once and has been picked by Alice.

4. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - **Counting Elements:**
     - It uses `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - **Finding the MEX:**
     - It initializes a variable `first` to `False` to track if Alice has picked a unique element.
     - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`:
       - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`, which is the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, and `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This means Alice has already picked a unique element, and Bob will pick the next unique element, making `i` the MEX.
       - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and has a count of 1, it sets `first` to `True`. This means Alice will pick this unique element on her next turn.

5. **Optimality Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `arr` or is unique and has been picked by Alice.
   - However, the logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where both Alice and Bob play optimally. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Bob will always try to remove the smallest unique element that Alice has not yet picked, which can affect the MEX calculation.

6. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the first test case `[0, 0, 1, 1]`:
     - The program correctly identifies that the MEX is `2` because `0` and `1` are both present in the array.
   - For the second test case `[0, 1, 2, 3]`:
     - The program prints `1`, which is incorrect. The correct MEX should be `4` because all elements `0, 1, 2, 3` are present in the array.
   - For the third test case `[1, 1]`:
     - The program correctly identifies that the MEX is `0` because `0` is not present in the array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It fails to correctly calculate the MEX in some cases, particularly when Bob's optimal play is not considered.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
