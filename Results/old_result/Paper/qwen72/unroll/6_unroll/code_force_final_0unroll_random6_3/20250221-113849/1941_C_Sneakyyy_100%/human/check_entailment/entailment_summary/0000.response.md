### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to delete from a string `s` to make it beautiful. A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The program should handle multiple test cases, each with a string of length `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `ans` to 0, which will keep track of the number of deletions needed.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `s` and checks for the substrings "map" or "pie" in a sliding window of size 3.
   - If the substring "map" or "pie" is found, it increments the counter `ans` by 1 and skips the next 3 characters.
   - If the substring is not found, it moves to the next character.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

3. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly identifies non-overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" and counts them.
   - However, the program only increments `ans` by 1 for each occurrence of "map" or "pie", which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to count the number of characters that need to be deleted to remove the substring, which is 3 characters for each occurrence.
   - The program does not handle overlapping occurrences correctly. For example, in the string "mappppie", the program will only count "map" and "pie" once, but it should count the overlapping "pie" as well.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input "mmapnapie", the program outputs 2, which is correct because removing the 4th and 9th characters makes the string beautiful.
   - For the input "azabazapi", the program outputs 0, which is correct because the string is already beautiful.
   - For the input "mappppie", the program outputs 2, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3 because removing the first 3 characters ("map") makes the string "pppie", and then removing the next 3 characters ("pie") makes the string "ppp".
   - For the input "mapmapmapmapmapmap", the program outputs 6, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 18 because each "map" or "pie" requires 3 deletions, and there are 6 such substrings.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It only counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie" and does not account for the actual number of deletions required.

Correctness: **False**
