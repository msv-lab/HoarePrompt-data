Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Understanding:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) — the number of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - The first line with three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.
     - The second line with `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) — the values shown on the cubes.

2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output "YES" if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, and "MAYBE" if it may be either removed or left.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` from the first line and stores them in a list `b`.
   - It then reads the values of the cubes from the second line and stores them in a list `o`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If `k == n`, it prints "YES" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if all cubes are removed, the favorite cube will definitely be removed.

3. **Finding the Favorite Cube Value:**
   - It finds the value of the favorite cube using `fav = o[f - 1]`. This is correct because the index `f` is 1-based, so `f - 1` is the correct 0-based index.

4. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It creates a dictionary `dic` to count the occurrences of each cube value in the list `o`. This is correct and helps in determining how many cubes of each value are present.

5. **Sorting the List:**
   - It sorts the list `o` in non-increasing order using `o.sort(reverse=True)`. This is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

6. **Checking the Position of the Favorite Cube:**
   - It checks if the index of the favorite cube value in the sorted list `o` is greater than `k - 1` using `if o.index(fav) > k - 1`. If true, it prints "NO" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, it will not be removed.

7. **Handling Ties:**
   - It creates a sorted list of unique values `l` in non-increasing order using `l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)`.
   - It iterates over the unique values in `l` and subtracts the count of each value from `k` until it reaches the favorite cube value.
   - If `k` becomes less than or equal to 0 before reaching the favorite cube value, it prints "NO". This is correct because it means the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes.
   - If `k` is still greater than 0 when it reaches the favorite cube value, it prints "YES". This is correct because it means the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes.
   - If `k` becomes exactly 0 when it reaches the favorite cube value, it prints "MAYBE". This is correct because it means the favorite cube could be the last cube removed or not removed depending on the order of cubes with the same value.

### Issues:
1. **Indexing Error:**
   - The program uses `b[1]` and `b[2]` for `f` and `k`, but `b[0]` should be `n`. This is incorrect and should be fixed.

2. **Dictionary Usage:**
   - The dictionary `dic` is created but not used correctly in the loop. The loop should use the counts from `dic` to determine the number of cubes removed.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check for "MAYBE" is not correctly implemented. It should check if the favorite cube is exactly at the `k`-th position after sorting.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        o = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in set(o)}
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        removed = 0
        for value in sorted(set(o), reverse=True):
            if value == fav:
                if removed + dic[value] > k:
                    print('YES')
                elif removed + dic[value] == k:
                    print('MAYBE')
                else:
                    print('NO')
                break
            removed += dic[value]
            if removed >= k:
                print('NO')
                break
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical and indexing errors.
- The corrected program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases.

Correctness: **False**
