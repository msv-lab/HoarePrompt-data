Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here is an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
No
No
Yes
```

The program fails in the first test case. The array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` can be transformed into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` by splitting the element `12` into `1` and `2`, and the array becomes sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program does not correctly identify this and prints `No`.

The issue lies in the way the program attempts to split elements and check if the array is sorted. It only checks and splits elements one by one, and it does not consider the possibility of multiple splits or the need to re-check the sorted condition after each split. This results in incorrect outputs for cases where multiple splits are required or where the split needs to be applied in a different order to achieve a sorted array.
