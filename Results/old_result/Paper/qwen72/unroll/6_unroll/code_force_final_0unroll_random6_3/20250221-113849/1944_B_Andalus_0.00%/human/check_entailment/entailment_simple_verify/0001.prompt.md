You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and a list of integers `lst` of length `2n`. It then processes the list to find and print pairs of integers from the left and right halves of the sorted list, ensuring that the total number of printed integers is `k`. After each iteration, the variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, and `sz` are reset for the next iteration. The final state of these variables is undefined as they are reinitialized in each iteration. The only variable that remains unchanged is `T`, which is the total number of iterations the loop will execute.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is necessary to easily find pairs of identical elements.

4. **Finding Pairs in `lft`:**
   - The program iterates through `lft` to find pairs of identical elements and appends them to `ldb`.
   - It also keeps track of single elements that do not form pairs in `sng`.

5. **Finding Pairs in `rgt`:**
   - Similarly, the program iterates through `rgt` to find pairs of identical elements and appends them to `rdb`.

6. **Constructing the Output Arrays:**
   - The program constructs the output arrays `l` and `r` by printing elements from `ldb` and `sng` to ensure the length of each array is `2k`.
   - It prints pairs of identical elements from `ldb` first, and if needed, single elements from `sng` to fill the required length.

7. **Ensuring Correct Length:**
   - The program uses a counter `sz` to keep track of the number of elements printed so far. It ensures that exactly `2k` elements are printed for both `l` and `r`.

8. **Bitwise XOR Check:**
   - The problem requires that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` be equal. The program does not explicitly check this condition, but it relies on the fact that pairs of identical elements have a bitwise XOR of 0, and the XOR of a single element with itself is also 0. This is a valid approach because the problem guarantees that a solution always exists.

### Potential Issues:
- **Handling Single Elements:**
  - The program appends single elements to `sng` only if they are not followed by their pair in `lft`. This might lead to issues if the single elements are not correctly identified.
  - The program should ensure that single elements are correctly identified and used in the output arrays.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program prints elements directly without constructing the final arrays `l` and `r`. This is acceptable for the problem, but it might be more readable to construct the arrays and then print them.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the correct logic for finding pairs and single elements to construct the output arrays `l` and `r` of length `2k` such that their bitwise XORs are equal. However, the handling of single elements in `sng` might need a more robust approach to ensure correctness in all cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a potential issue in how it handles single elements in `sng`. Specifically, the condition `elif i < n - 1 and lft[i] != lft[i + 1]` might not correctly identify all single elements, leading to incorrect output in some cases. Additionally, the program does not explicitly check the XOR condition, which, while not necessary due to the problem's guarantee, could be a point of concern for thoroughness.
