The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the first line is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct. The function outputs the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string.

Functionality: **The function reads a number of test cases `t` from stdin, followed by `t` distinct strings of length 5 containing only 'A' and 'B'. It returns the most frequent character ('A' or 'B') for each string.**
