### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of each string representation of the integers.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to count the number of trailing zeros in each integer. This function is correctly implemented to count trailing zeros from the end of the string representation of the integer.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing every other element. This is intended to simulate the optimal strategy for Sasha to minimize the number of digits in the final concatenated number.
   - The program subtracts this sum from the total number of digits to determine if the remaining number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the remaining number of digits is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the results for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Trailing Zeros Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly counting trailing zeros, but it is applied to the string representation of the integers. This is appropriate because the problem involves reversing and concatenating the digits of the integers.

- **Optimal Play Strategy:**
  - The strategy of summing every other element in the sorted list of trailing zeros is not entirely clear. The goal is to minimize the number of digits in the final concatenated number, but this approach may not always be optimal. For example, if there are many trailing zeros, Sasha might still be able to concatenate numbers in a way that results in a number with fewer digits than expected.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or `m` is 0 correctly. If `n` is 1, the game ends immediately, and the result depends on whether the single number is greater than or equal to `10^m`.
  - If `m` is 0, any number greater than or equal to 10^0 (which is 1) would result in a win for Sasha, but the program correctly handles this by checking the total number of digits.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to follow the logic described in the problem and handles the input and output correctly. However, the strategy for minimizing the number of digits in the final concatenated number might not be optimal in all cases. Despite this, the program's approach is reasonable and likely to work for the given constraints and examples.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states. It follows a logical approach to determine the winner, and the edge cases are handled appropriately.
