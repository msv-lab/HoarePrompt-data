Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are specific integers provided by the input, `rows` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element `rows[i][j]` represents the depth `a_{i,j}` of the river cell, and `rows[i][1]` and `rows[i][m]` are 0 for all `i` in the range [0, n-1]. `costs` is a list of integers where each element is the result of applying `func_1` to each row of `rows` with the argument `d`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
- The 2D list `rows` is also unchanged.
- The list comprehension creates a new list `costs` where each element is the result of calling `func_1` with a row from `rows` and the integer `d`.
- The specific values in `costs` depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the values in `rows` and `d`, but the structure of `costs` is a list of integers with the same length as `rows`.
