Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where a slime can be eaten by a neighbor on its right side. The program only checks if a slime can be eaten by a neighbor on its left side, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 4
```

The expected output should be:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
2 1 -1 1 -1
```

The 5th slime (with size 4) should be able to be eaten by the 3rd slime (after the 3rd slime eats the 4th slime and grows to size 4 + 1 = 5), but the program incorrectly reports that the 5th slime cannot be eaten. This is a clear violation of the problem requirements, making the program incorrect.
