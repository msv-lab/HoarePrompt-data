Reasoning:  
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description that specifies the first line of input should contain a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, processing each test case. This is also consistent with the problem description.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case. This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which correctly splits the input line into three integers.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - It then checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints 'NONE'.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions provided. The output format matches the problem description.

6. **State After Execution**: The program does not return any value, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined after the loop completes, which is expected since they are reassigned in each iteration. The loop index `i` is equal to `n-1` after the loop completes, which is also correct.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
