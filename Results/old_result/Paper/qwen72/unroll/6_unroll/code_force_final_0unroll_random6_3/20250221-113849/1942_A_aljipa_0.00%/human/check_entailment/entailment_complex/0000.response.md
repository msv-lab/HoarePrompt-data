### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Output Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**
     - If `k` equals `n`, the function prints a list of `n` ones.
     - This is correct because an array of `n` ones will have exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts, as every cyclic shift of the array will be sorted.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**
     - If `k` equals 1, the function prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will not be sorted.
   - **Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1`**
     - If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, the function prints `-1`.
     - This is incorrect because the problem statement does not restrict the solution to only `k == n` or `k == 1`. There can be other valid arrays that satisfy the condition for other values of `k`.

3. **General Solution:**
   - The function does not handle the general case where `k` is neither `n` nor 1. For example, if `k == 2`, there are valid arrays that can be constructed, such as `[1, 2, 1]` for `n == 3`.
   - The function should be able to handle all valid values of `k` and `n` as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `k` is neither `n` nor 1. Therefore, it will fail to provide a valid solution for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
