Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, if `n` is 2, the minimum value of the two elements in the array `a` is printed. If `n` is greater than 2, the maximum of the second largest elements from every consecutive triplet in the array `a` is printed. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not retained between test cases, and their values are reset for each new test case.**
