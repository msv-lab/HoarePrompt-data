The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `s_list` contains `t` strings, where each string `s` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases in `s_list`. The exact nature of the results is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each string in `s_list` and returns a result based on some processing logic.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to one of the test cases in `s_list`.**
