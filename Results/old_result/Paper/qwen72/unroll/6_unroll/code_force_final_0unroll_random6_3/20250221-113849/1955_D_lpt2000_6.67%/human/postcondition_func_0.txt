The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `a` that contain at least `k` elements matching the elements in the list `b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is reset for each new test case, with no lasting effects on the overall program state.
