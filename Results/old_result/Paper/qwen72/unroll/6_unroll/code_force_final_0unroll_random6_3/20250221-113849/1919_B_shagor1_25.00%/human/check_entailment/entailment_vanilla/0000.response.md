### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - It reads the length of the string `n`.
   - It reads the string `s` which consists of characters '+' and '-'.
   - It initializes a variable `neg` to count the number of '-' characters in the string.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and increments `neg` for each '-' character.
   - Finally, it prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - The penalty for a single array is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.

4. **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is zero.
   - If the sum of the entire array `a` is zero, the minimum penalty is zero.
   - If the sum of the entire array `a` is not zero, the best we can do is to split the array into subarrays of length 1, each contributing a penalty of 1.

5. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `n - 2 * neg` calculates the number of '+' characters minus the number of '-' characters.
   - If `n` (the total number of characters) is not equal to `neg` (the number of '-' characters), the expression `n - 2 * neg` gives the sum of the array `a`.
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means all characters are '-', and the sum of the array `a` is `-n`. In this case, the penalty is `n` because each '-' character contributes a penalty of 1 when split into subarrays of length 1.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `s` consists entirely of '+' characters, `neg` will be 0, and the expression `n - 2 * neg` will be `n`, which is the correct penalty.
   - If `s` consists entirely of '-' characters, `neg` will be `n`, and the expression `n - 2 * neg` will be `-n`, but the `else` clause ensures the penalty is `n`.
   - If `s` has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, `neg` will be `n/2`, and the expression `n - 2 * neg` will be 0, which is the correct penalty.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by counting the number of '-' characters and using the derived expression to calculate the minimum possible penalty. The logic is sound and covers all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
