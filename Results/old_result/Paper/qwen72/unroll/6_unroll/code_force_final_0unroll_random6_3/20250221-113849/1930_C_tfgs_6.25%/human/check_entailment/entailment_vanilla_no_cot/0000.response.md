Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Insertion Logic**: The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element and then uses a `Counter` to handle duplicates. However, the problem requires inserting `a_i + i` into a set and then deleting `a_i` from the array. The program does not simulate the deletion of elements from `a` after each insertion, which is crucial for the correct operation.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Set Operations**: The program converts the modified array `a` into a set and sorts it in reverse order. This approach does not account for the fact that the set `S` should be constructed by inserting elements in a specific order and then sorted to form `b`.

3. **Incorrect Construction of `b`**: The program attempts to construct the array `b` by appending elements from the sorted set and handling duplicates in a way that does not align with the problem's requirements. The logic for appending elements and handling duplicates is flawed and does not produce the lexicographically largest `b`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Simulate the operations as described:
   - Select an index `i` such that `1 <= i <= |a|`.
   - Insert `a_i + i` into the set `S`.
   - Delete `a_i` from `a`.
2. Construct the set `S` and then sort it in decreasing order to form the array `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    S = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Set Construction**: For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`. It then simulates the operations by adding `a_i + i + 1` to the set `S` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
3. **Sorting and Output**: After constructing the set `S`, it sorts the elements in decreasing order and prints them.

This approach correctly follows the problem's requirements and ensures that the set `S` is constructed and sorted to form the lexicographically largest array `b`.
