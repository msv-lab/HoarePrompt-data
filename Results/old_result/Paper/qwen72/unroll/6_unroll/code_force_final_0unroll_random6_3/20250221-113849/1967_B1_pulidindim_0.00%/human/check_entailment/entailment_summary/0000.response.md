### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, and `ans` is initialized to `n`. This initialization is based on the assumption that for each `b` from 1 to `m`, the pair `(a, 1)` is always valid for all `a` from 1 to `n` because `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1`.

3. **Loop for `b` from 2 to `m`:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` starting from 2 up to `m`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates `countmins` as `b - 1`.
   - It then calculates `g` as `n / b` and checks if `g` is less than `countmins`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - If `g` is not less than `countmins`, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds `g / b + 1` to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b \cdot \gcd(a, b)` can be rewritten as:
  \[
  (a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0
  \]
- For `b = 1`, the condition simplifies to:
  \[
  (a + 1) \mod 1 = 0
  \]
  which is always true for any integer `a`. Therefore, all pairs `(a, 1)` are valid, and there are `n` such pairs.

- For `b > 1`, the condition becomes more complex. The program attempts to count valid pairs by iterating over `b` and adjusting `ans` based on the value of `g`.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Calculation of `g`:**
  - The variable `g` is calculated as `n / b`, which is a floating-point division. This is not appropriate for integer operations.
  - The correct way to calculate `g` should be integer division: `g = n // b`.

- **Incorrect Update of `ans`:**
  - The update `ans += g / b + 1` is also incorrect. It should be `ans += g // b + 1` to ensure integer division.

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop termination condition `if g < countmins` is not clearly justified and may lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n // count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g // count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

### Final Correctness:

- The program's logic is flawed in the calculation and update of `ans`.
- The corrected program should use integer division and properly handle the loop termination condition.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The original program does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. The issues in the calculation and update of `ans` need to be addressed to ensure the program produces the correct output.
