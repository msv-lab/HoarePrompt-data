The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `vals`. For the loop to execute, `vals` must be a non-empty list. Given the state before the loop, `N` is an input integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and `vals` is a list of N integers where 2 <= `vals[i]` <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, this ensures that `vals` is non-empty and contains at least one element.

Since `den` is equal to the first integer in the list `vals`, and `vals` is guaranteed to have at least one element, `den` is already correctly set. However, for the loop to execute, `x` must be set to the first element of `vals` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`N` is an input integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, `vals` is a list of N integers such that 2 <= `vals[i]` <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N, `den` is equal to the first integer in the list `vals`, `x` is the first integer in the list `vals`**
