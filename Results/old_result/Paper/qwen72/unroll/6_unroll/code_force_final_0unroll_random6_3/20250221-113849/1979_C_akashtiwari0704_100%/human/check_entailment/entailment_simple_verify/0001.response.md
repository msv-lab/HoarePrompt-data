### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the amount received if it wins is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(k_i\) is the multiplier and \(x_i\) is the bet.
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It then sets each bet \(x_i\) to \(\frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\).
   - The sum of all bets is calculated and compared to the LCM.
   - If the sum of bets is less than the LCM, the solution is valid; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
   - This approach ensures that the total amount bet is a common multiple of all multipliers, which helps in comparing the total bet to the individual winnings.

4. **Sum of Bets:**
   - The sum of the bets is calculated as \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\).
   - If this sum is less than the LCM, it means that the total amount bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome, satisfying the condition.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \(k_i\) are the same, the sum of bets will be equal to the LCM, which is not strictly less than the LCM. Hence, the program correctly prints \(-1\) in such cases.
   - For different multipliers, the program should find a valid solution if one exists.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the multipliers for each test case.
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers and sets the bets accordingly.
   - It checks if the sum of bets is less than the LCM and prints the result.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).

- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM function is correctly implemented using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
  - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated and stored in the variable `prod`.

- **Bet Calculation:**
  - Each bet \(x_i\) is set to \(\frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i}\), which is a valid approach to ensure that the bets are proportional to the multipliers.
  - The sum of all bets is calculated and stored in the variable `sumo`.

- **Condition Check:**
  - The program checks if the sum of bets `sumo` is less than the LCM `prod`.
  - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints \(-1\), indicating that no valid solution exists.
  - If `sumo` is less than `prod`, it prints the bets.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where all multipliers are the same. In such cases, the sum of bets will be equal to the LCM, and the program prints \(-1\).
  - For different multipliers, the program finds a valid solution if one exists.

### Final Evaluation:

- The program follows the correct logic to solve the problem.
- It handles the edge case where all multipliers are the same and prints \(-1\).
- It correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
