#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined in the provided context. However, based on the problem description, the function should be defined as `def func(t, n, f, k, a):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `f` is an integer representing the index of Dmitry's favorite cube (1 ≤ f ≤ n), `k` is an integer representing the number of cubes to be removed (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `a` is a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        
        b = list(map(int, a.split()))
        
        o = input().split()
        
        n = b[0]
        
        f = b[1]
        
        k = b[2]
        
        if k == n:
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        fav = o[f - 1]
        
        dic = {i: o.count(i) for i in o}
        
        o.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if o.index(fav) > k - 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        l = sorted(list(set(o)), reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if fav != l[i]:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k <= 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                k -= dic[l[i]]
                if k < 0:
                    print('MAYBE')
                    break
                else:
                    print('YES')
                    break
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the input to determine if Dmitry's favorite cube can remain after removing `k` cubes. The variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are reinitialized at the start of each iteration based on the input, and the loop prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be in their final state as determined by the last iteration's input, but the overall state of the program will depend on the sequence of inputs provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads input values `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. It then determines if Dmitry's favorite cube (index `f-1`) can remain in the list after removing `k` cubes. The function prints 'YES' if the favorite cube can definitely remain, 'NO' if it cannot, and 'MAYBE' if it might remain depending on the specific cubes removed. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` will be in their final state as determined by the last test case's input.
