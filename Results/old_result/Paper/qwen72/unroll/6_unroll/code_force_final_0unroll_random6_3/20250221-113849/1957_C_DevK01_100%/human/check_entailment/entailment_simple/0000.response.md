Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played. It then reads the `k` moves and processes them.

2. **Move Processing**: The program correctly processes each move by decrementing `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not:
   - If `a != b`, both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move are valid, so `n` is decremented by 2.
   - If `a == b`, the computer skips its turn, so `n` is decremented by 1.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations using a dynamic programming approach. The sequence `dp` is initialized with the base cases `dp = [1, 1]`, which are correct for the initial configurations:
   - `dp[0]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a 0x0 board, which is 1 (the empty board).
   - `dp[1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on a 1x1 board, which is also 1 (one rook in the only cell).

4. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]` is correct. It calculates the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board by considering:
   - The number of ways to place rooks on an `(i-1) x (i-1)` board (`dp[-1]`).
   - The number of ways to place rooks on an `(i-2) x (i-2)` board and then place two rooks in the new row and column (`2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]`).

5. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation `%(7 + 10 ** 9)` ensures that the result is within the required range.

6. **State Maintenance**: The program maintains the state of `dp` correctly by appending the new value and removing the oldest value, ensuring that `dp` always contains the last two computed values.

7. **Final Output**: The program correctly returns the last computed value of the sequence, which is the number of possible final configurations for the given `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
