Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged, `func` remains undefined, and the loop has processed `t` test cases. For each test case, the list `a` is modified such that each element is the result of `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the original elements in `a`. The variable `sumo` is the sum of the modified elements in `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, the output for that test case is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is a space-separated string of the modified elements in `a`.**
