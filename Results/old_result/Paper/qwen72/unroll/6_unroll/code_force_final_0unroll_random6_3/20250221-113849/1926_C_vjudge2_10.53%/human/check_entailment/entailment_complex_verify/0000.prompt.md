You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

    #State: The `sum_values` list is accessed and printed for each integer in the `numbers` list. The values of `t`, `n`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, and `total` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number. It then calculates a cumulative sum of values for numbers up to the largest `n` across all test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the values of its last digit and the remaining part of the number. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the test cases. The function does not return any value; it only performs input and output operations.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input `n` is greater than the maximum value in the `numbers` list. The loop that calculates the `values` and `sum_values` arrays only runs up to `n + 1`, but `n` can vary for each test case. If `n` is greater than the maximum value in `numbers`, the program will not have precomputed the required values, leading to incorrect results for those test cases. For example, if the input is:
```
2
100
200
```
The program will only compute values up to `200`, but it will not handle the case where `n` is `200` correctly because it will not have computed the values for `100` and above. This is a potential edge case where the program fails to meet the problem description.
