Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logical error in the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. The bitwise AND operator `&` has a higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, which means the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`. This is incorrect because the intended condition is to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, which should be written as `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the case where `a = 1` and `b = 2`:
- The correct condition should be `(1 + 2) & 1 == 0`, which evaluates to `3 & 1 == 0` (or `0`), indicating that the sum is odd.
- However, the program evaluates `1 + 2 & 1` as `1 + (2 & 1)`, which is `1 + 0` (or `1`), incorrectly indicating that the sum is even.

This incorrect condition will lead to the wrong output for many test cases. For example, the program will incorrectly output "Bob" for the case `a = 1` and `b = 2`, when the correct output should be "Alice".
