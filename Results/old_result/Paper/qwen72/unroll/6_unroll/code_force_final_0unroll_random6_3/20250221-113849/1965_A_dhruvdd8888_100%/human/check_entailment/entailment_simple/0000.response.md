### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - `N` is read as the number of piles.
     - `nums` is read as a set of strings representing the number of stones in each pile.
     - The string '0' is added to the set `nums`.
     - The set `nums` is then converted to a sorted list of integers.
     - This step is problematic because adding '0' to the set and then converting it to a list means that the list `nums` will always contain a zero, which is not part of the original input and can affect the logic.

3. **Pile Reduction Logic:**
   - The program initializes `ls` to 0.
   - It iterates over the sorted list `nums` and subtracts `ls` from each element.
   - It then adds the current element to `ls`.
   - This logic is intended to simulate the removal of stones, but it is not clear how this relates to the game's rules. The game requires removing a positive integer `k` from each nonempty pile, and this logic does not correctly simulate that.

4. **Winning Condition Logic:**
   - The program initializes `nw` and `cw` to `True`.
   - It iterates over the list `nums` from the second last element to the second element.
   - If the current element is 1, it toggles `cw` to the opposite of `nw`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `cw` to `True`.
   - Finally, it prints "Alice" if `cw` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.
   - This logic is based on the idea that if there are an odd number of piles with 1 stone, the player who is about to move will win. However, this is not a correct representation of the game's optimal play.

5. **Correctness of the Game Logic:**
   - The game is a variant of the Nim game, where the optimal strategy involves the concept of the Nim-sum (XOR of the pile sizes).
   - The correct approach to determine the winner is to calculate the Nim-sum of the pile sizes. If the Nim-sum is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - The current program does not use the Nim-sum and instead uses a flawed logic involving the presence of 1s in the pile sizes.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game and contains logical errors. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
