Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the minimum length of a segment of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element of the array. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**: The program focuses on finding the minimum length of a segment of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element. This does not necessarily help in determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The problem requires ensuring that no operation can be performed to make all elements the same, which involves more than just checking segments of consecutive elements.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The program calculates the minimum length of a segment of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`). This is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of elements to remove. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will find the segment `[1, 2, 1]` and output `1`, but removing one element does not necessarily make the array non-beautiful. The correct approach should involve checking if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements such that no valid operation can be performed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element (`n == 1`) by printing `-1`. However, it also prints `-1` if all elements are the same (`ans == n`), which is correct but does not address the core issue of the flawed logic.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
