You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: a is a list of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, but the first k * 2 elements (if k * 2 ≤ n) or the first k elements (if k * 2 > n) have been printed and removed from the list. The remaining elements in the list are still in their original positions. k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, and the values of l, r, re, ul, ur, and res are modified based on the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of inputs where each input consists of an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function prints pairs of integers from the list `a` such that each integer appears exactly twice, up to a total of `k * 2` integers. If fewer than `k * 2` integers are printed, it continues to print single integers from the list until the total number of printed integers equals `k * 2`. The function does not return any value but modifies the state of the program by printing the selected integers and potentially altering the internal variables used for tracking. After the function concludes, the list `a` remains unchanged, but the internal variables `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` are modified as part of the execution process.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each element in the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the first half of `a` and increments the count in `l` for each element.
   - It iterates through the second half of `a` and increments the count in `r` for each element.

3. **Constructing the Subsets:**
   - The program initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to keep track of the number of elements selected for the subsets and the number of elements in `l` and `r` that have been used.
   - It iterates through the first half of `a` to find elements that appear twice in `l` and prints them, setting their count to 0 and incrementing `ul` by 2.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, it calculates the remaining number of elements needed (`k = 2 * k - ul`).
   - It then iterates through the first half of `a` again to find elements that appear once in `l` and prints them, setting their count to 0 and incrementing `re` by 1.
   - It appends these elements to the list `res`.

5. **Printing the Second Subset:**
   - The program prints the elements in `res` for the second subset.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it iterates through the second half of `a` to find elements that appear twice in `r` and prints them, setting their count to 0 and incrementing `ur` by 2.
   - It breaks out of the loop when `ul` equals `ur`.

### Analysis:

- **Subset Construction:**
  - The program correctly identifies elements that appear twice in the first half and prints them, ensuring that `l` is a subset of the first half of `a`.
  - It then handles elements that appear once in the first half and appends them to `res` to ensure that the total length of `l` is `2k`.

- **Second Subset Construction:**
  - The program prints the elements in `res` for the second subset, ensuring that `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`.
  - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it correctly identifies elements that appear twice in the second half and prints them to ensure that the total length of `r` is `2k`.

- **XOR Condition:**
  - The program does not explicitly check the XOR condition, but it is designed to ensure that the elements in `l` and `r` are chosen in such a way that their XORs will be equal. This is because the elements are chosen from the same set and the problem guarantees that a solution always exists.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 and the case where `k` is greater than 1.
  - It ensures that the subsets are of the correct length and that the elements are chosen from the appropriate halves of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and follows the problem requirements. It constructs the subsets `l` and `r` such that their lengths are `2k` and the XOR condition is satisfied.

Correctness: **True**
