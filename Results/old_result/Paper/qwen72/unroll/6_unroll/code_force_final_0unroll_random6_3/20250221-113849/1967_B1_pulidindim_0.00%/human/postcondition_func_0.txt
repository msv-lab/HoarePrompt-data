The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the input. It then calculates a value `ans` based on the inputs `n` and `m` and prints the integer value of `ans` for each test case. The values of `n` and `m` are updated for each test case, and the final state of the program after all test cases are processed is that `t` test cases have been completed, with the corresponding `ans` values printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
