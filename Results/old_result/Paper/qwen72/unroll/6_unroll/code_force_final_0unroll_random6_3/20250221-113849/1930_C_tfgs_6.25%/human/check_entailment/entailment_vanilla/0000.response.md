### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Operation Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the operation of adding `a[i] + i + 1` to the set `S` for each element in the array `a`.
   - This is done by iterating over the array and modifying each element in place: `a[i] += i + 1`.

3. **Set and Counter**:
   - The modified array `a` is then converted to a set to ensure all elements are unique.
   - A `Counter` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the modified array.

4. **Sorting and Lexicographical Construction**:
   - The unique elements are sorted in descending order to form the array `b`.
   - The program then constructs the lexicographically largest array `b` by:
     - Iterating over the sorted unique elements.
     - For each element, it tries to add as many elements as possible that are just below the current element but not already in the set.
     - This is done using the `adv` variable, which calculates the number of such elements that can be added.
     - The elements are added to the `ans` list and the `Counter` is updated accordingly.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After processing all unique elements, if there are still elements left to be added (tracked by `cnt`), the program adds the remaining elements in decreasing order starting from the last element in `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The constructed array `b` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Operation Simulation**:
  - The operation `a[i] += i + 1` is correctly applied to each element of the array.
  - This ensures that the elements inserted into the set `S` are unique and correctly calculated.

- **Set and Counter Usage**:
  - Using a set to ensure uniqueness and a `Counter` to track frequencies is appropriate for this problem.
  - The set conversion and sorting are done correctly.

- **Lexicographical Construction**:
  - The program correctly aims to construct the lexicographically largest array by trying to add as many elements as possible just below the current element.
  - The use of `adv` to calculate the number of such elements is logical and ensures that the array is constructed in the desired order.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where there are still elements left to be added after processing all unique elements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and construct the lexicographically largest array `b`.
