Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`, followed by the operations and the queries. This matches the problem description.

2. **Operation Handling**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: When the operation type is 1, the program appends the integer `x` to the array `array`. This is correct according to the problem description.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: When the operation type is 2, the program extends the array `array` by appending `x` copies of the current array to itself. However, the implementation in `func_1` is incorrect because it only appends one copy of the array, not `x` copies. The correct implementation should be `array.extend(array * (value - 1))` instead of `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])`.

3. **Query Handling**: After performing all operations, the program processes the queries. It calculates the result for each query by taking the element at the position `(k - 1) % len(array)` in the array. This is correct because it ensures that the query index wraps around if it exceeds the length of the array.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the type 2 operations correctly. It should append `x` copies of the array, but it only appends one copy.

Correctness: **False**
