Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by checking the conditions for a stair or a peak, and prints the appropriate output for each case. The conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`) are accurately checked, and the program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
