### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case to compute the MEX of the array `c` after the game.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each element.
   - This part is correct and ensures that `freq[i]` contains the count of the integer `i` in `arr`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a counter `cou` to keep track of the number of unique elements that appear exactly once in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the frequency array `freq` from 0 to `n`.
   - If an element appears at least twice (`freq[i] >= 2`), it continues to the next element.
   - If an element appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), it increments the counter `cou`.
   - If the counter `cou` reaches 2 or if an element does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic is based on the idea that the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`. Since Alice and Bob are playing optimally, the MEX will be the smallest index `i` where either `freq[i] == 0` or `cou == 2`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice and Bob both trying to control the elements that appear exactly once in `arr` because these elements are crucial for determining the MEX.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest index `i` where either `freq[i] == 0` or `cou == 2`, which ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated.
   - This is because if `cou` reaches 2, it means there are two unique elements in `c` that appear exactly once, and the next smallest integer that is not in `c` will be the MEX. If `freq[i] == 0`, it means `i` is the smallest integer not in `arr`, and thus not in `c`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the array `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` exactly once, which would result in a MEX of `n`.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `arr` are the same, resulting in a MEX of 0.
   - These edge cases are correctly managed by the logic in the loop.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is suitable given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is also O(n) due to the frequency array `freq`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game, considering the optimal strategies of both Alice and Bob. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
