The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` (the number of test cases) is within the given range and that the input for the loop is a valid integer that is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
