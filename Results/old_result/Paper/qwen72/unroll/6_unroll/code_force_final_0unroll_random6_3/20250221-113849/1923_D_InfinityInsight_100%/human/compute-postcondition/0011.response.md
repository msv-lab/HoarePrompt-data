The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` is within the range 1 to 10^9, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer within the range 1 to 3 * 10^5. The function returns a list `ans` of the same length as `a`. For each index `i` in the list `a`:
- If `a[i] < a[i - 1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1.
- If `a[i] >= a[i - 1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i - 1]`, and `inx` is non-negative.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is 1 if `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, and `i + 1 - inx` otherwise, with `inx` being the minimum of `func_1(left, x)` and `last[i - 1]`.**
