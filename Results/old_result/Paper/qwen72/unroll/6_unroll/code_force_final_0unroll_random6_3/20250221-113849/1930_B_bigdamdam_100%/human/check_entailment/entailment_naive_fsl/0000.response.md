Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when \( n \) is odd correctly. Specifically, the second loop that fills the odd indices does not start with the correct value for \( ind \). 

For example, consider \( n = 5 \):
- The first loop will set `p` to `[5, 0, 3, 0, 1]`.
- The second loop will start with `ind = 1 + 5 % 2`, which is `2`. It will then set `p` to `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

However, the correct permutation for \( n = 5 \) should be something like `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]` to ensure that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

The issue lies in the initialization of `ind` in the second loop. It should be initialized to `1` if \( n \) is odd, and to `2` if \( n \) is even. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to potential invalid permutations for odd \( n \).
