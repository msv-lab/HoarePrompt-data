Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (where \(1 \le t \le 1000\)) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (where \(1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}\)). The function then prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`, or 'YES' followed by 2 and the values of `n - k + 1` and 1 if `n + 2 > k * 2`, or 'NO' if neither condition is met. After processing all test cases, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged. **
