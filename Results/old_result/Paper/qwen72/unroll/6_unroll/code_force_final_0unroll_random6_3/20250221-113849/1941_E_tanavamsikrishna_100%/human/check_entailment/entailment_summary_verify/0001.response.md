### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the first cell with a cost of 1 (since \(a_{i,1} = 0\)).
   - It then iterates through the first d cells, setting their costs to \(a_{i,j} + 2\) (since the first support is already placed at the first column).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last d+1 cells.
   - For each cell beyond the first d cells, it pops the minimum cost from the heap that is within the valid range (i.e., the distance from the current cell is no more than d).
   - It updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - It pushes the updated cost and the current cell index back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to install supports for the entire row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, including the dimensions of the grid (n, m), the number of bridges (k), and the maximum distance between supports (d).
   - It reads the grid values for each row.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - **Initialization of the first cell**: The first cell is correctly initialized with a cost of 1.
   - **Cost calculation for the first d cells**: The cost for the first d cells is correctly set to \(a_{i,j} + 2\).
   - **Min-heap usage**: The min-heap is used to efficiently find the minimum cost for each cell, considering the constraint on the maximum distance between supports.
   - **Cost update for cells beyond the first d cells**: The cost of each cell beyond the first d cells is correctly updated by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell plus 1.
   - **Final cost calculation**: The function correctly returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to install supports for the entire row.
   - **Processing multiple test cases**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases and calculates the minimum total cost for k consecutive bridges.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity for `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\), where m is the number of columns and d is the maximum distance between supports.
   - The time complexity for `func_2` is \(O(t \cdot n \cdot m \log d)\), where t is the number of test cases, n is the number of rows, and m is the number of columns.
   - This complexity is efficient given the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows, considering the constraints and edge cases. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient computation, and the overall structure of the program is sound.

Final: **True**
