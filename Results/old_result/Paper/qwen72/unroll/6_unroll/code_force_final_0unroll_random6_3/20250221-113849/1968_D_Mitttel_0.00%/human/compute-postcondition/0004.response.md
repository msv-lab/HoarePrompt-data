Output State: **`start_pos` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `start_pos` <= `n`, `score` is 0, `current_pos` is equal to `start_pos`, `steps` is 0, `visited` is an empty dictionary, `cycle_start` is -1.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new assignment of `cycle_start` to -1.
