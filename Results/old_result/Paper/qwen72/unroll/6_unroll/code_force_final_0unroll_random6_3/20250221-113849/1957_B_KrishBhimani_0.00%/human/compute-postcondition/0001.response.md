Output State: **The loop processes each test case and prints the resulting array `ans` for each test case. The array `ans` is constructed such that it contains powers of 2 corresponding to the positions where the binary representation of `k` has a 1, and the remaining elements are 0. If the length of `ans` is less than `n`, it is padded with zeros. After all iterations of the loop, the variables `n`, `k`, and `k0` are reset for the next test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.**
