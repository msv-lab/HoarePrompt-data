Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array. The final answer should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for returning the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It takes an integer `number` and returns `number % 1000000007`.
   - This function is correct and straightforward.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `arr`.
   - However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` incorrectly. `new_segment` should be a list with two elements: the sum of the current segment and the starting index.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect. It does not properly handle the case where the current element is negative.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers. It should return the maximum subarray sum, which could be zero if the array is empty or all elements are negative.
     - The function returns a list with the sum of the maximum segment, the starting index, and the ending index. However, the ending index is not always correctly calculated.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the maximum possible sum after `k` operations using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it assumes that the maximum segment sum can be doubled `k` times, which is not always the case. The correct approach should involve finding the maximum subarray sum and using it to maximize the array sum over `k` operations.
   - The function `func_3` is not used in the main logic and is not relevant to the problem.

Given the issues in `func_2` and the main logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
