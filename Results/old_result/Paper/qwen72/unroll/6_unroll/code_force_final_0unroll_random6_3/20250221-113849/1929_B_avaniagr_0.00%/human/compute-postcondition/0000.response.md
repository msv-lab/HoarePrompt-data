The only objects in the loop head are `s` and the result of `[*open(0)][1:]`, so we can only adjust those. The loop will execute if `[*open(0)][1:]` is a non-empty list. This means that `open(0)` must return an iterable with at least two elements, where the first element is skipped and `s` is the second element.

State: **`[*open(0)][1:]` must be a non-empty list, `s` is the second element from the result of `[*open(0)]`**
