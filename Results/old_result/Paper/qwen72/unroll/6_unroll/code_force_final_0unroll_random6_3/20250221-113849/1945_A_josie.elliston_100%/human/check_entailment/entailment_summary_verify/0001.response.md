### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must be alone in a tent.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any type of tent configuration.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate extroverts and universals.
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3 to form a valid tent.
   - If the remaining extroverts plus universals is less than 3, it returns `None`, indicating it is impossible to form a valid tent.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed by combining the results from `func_1` and the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, and `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of the number of introverts (each needing their own tent) and the number of tents calculated by `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents needed is exactly the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents needed is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents needed is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function should handle cases where there are a mix of introverts, extroverts, and universals, ensuring that extroverts are always in tents of 3 people.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `1 2 3`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (need 1 more person to form a tent of 3)
     - Universals: 3 (1 universal can join the 2 extroverts, and the remaining 2 universals can form another tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Example 2:** `1 4 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (need 2 more people to form 2 tents of 3)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a valid tent with extroverts)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible to accommodate)
   - **Example 3:** `1 4 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (need 2 more people to form 2 tents of 3)
     - Universals: 2 (enough to form a valid tent with extroverts)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
   - **Example 4:** `1 1 1`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (need 2 more people to form a tent of 3)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form a valid tent with extroverts)
     - Total tents: -1 (impossible to accommodate)
   - **Example 5:** `1 3 2`
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (1 tent of 3 people)
     - Universals: 2 (can form another tent of 3 people with 1 universal and 1 introvert)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 1 (extroverts) + 1 (universals) = 3
   - **Example 6:** `19 7 18`
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (need 14 more people to form 3 tents of 3 people)
     - Universals: 18 (enough to form valid tents with extroverts and universals)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28
   - **Example 7:** `0 0 0`
     - No participants, so no tents needed.
     - Total tents: 0
   - **Example 8:** `7 0 0`
     - Only introverts, so 7 tents needed.
     - Total tents: 7
   - **Example 9:** `0 24 0`
     - Only extroverts, so 8 tents needed.
     - Total tents: 8
   - **Example 10:** `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (need 2000000000 more people to form 333333334 tents of 3 people)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (enough to form valid tents with extroverts and universals)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Function 1: `func_1`**
  - The function correctly checks if the number of extroverts is a multiple of 3.
  - If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts plus the number of universals is at least 3 to form a valid tent.
  - The ceiling function is used correctly to ensure that the number of tents is rounded up when necessary.

- **Function 2: `func_2`**
  - The function correctly handles the case where `func_1` returns `None` by returning -1.
  - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly handles the problem description and edge cases. It ensures that introverts are always alone, extroverts are always in tents of 3 people, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots as needed. The program returns -1 when it is impossible to form valid tents, and it calculates the minimum number of tents required otherwise.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
