The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s`, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 10^6. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, so it is unclear what the function returns. However, based on typical programming patterns, it is likely that the function processes the string `s` for each test case and returns some result based on the processing.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the length of the string `s`), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The function processes the string `s` for each test case and returns a result based on the processing, but the specific output is not provided.**
