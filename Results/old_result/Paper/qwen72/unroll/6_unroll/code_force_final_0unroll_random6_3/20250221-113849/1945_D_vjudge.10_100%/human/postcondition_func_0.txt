The function `func_1` accepts an integer `pergunta` representing the number of test cases, two lists of integers `a` and `b` of length `n`, and two integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000. It calculates the minimum value between the initial `pergunta` and the sum of `x + a[i]` for all `i < m`, where `x` is the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to `0`. The function then prints this minimum value. The input lists `a` and `b`, and the integers `n` and `m` remain unchanged after the function execution.
