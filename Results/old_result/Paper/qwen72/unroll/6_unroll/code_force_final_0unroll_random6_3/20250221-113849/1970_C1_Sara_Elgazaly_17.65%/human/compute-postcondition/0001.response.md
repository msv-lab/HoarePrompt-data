Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `u_1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lst` is a defaultdict with lists as default values.**

The code initializes `lst` as a `defaultdict` with lists as the default factory. This means that any key accessed in `lst` that does not already exist will automatically have an empty list as its value. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `u_1`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
