Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters in `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in `c`. However, it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the template according to the rules given in the problem description. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
In this case, the program will return 'YES' because `a[i] != c[i]` and `b[i] != c[i]` for all `i`. However, there is no template `t` that can satisfy the conditions for `a` and `b` to match and `c` to not match. For `a` and `b` to match, the template must have lowercase letters that match `a` and `b` exactly, but for `c` to not match, `c` must differ from `a` and `b` in every position, which is impossible with the given strings.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
