The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the counts of the substrings 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie' in `s` and prints the value of `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the count of 'map', `y` is the count of 'pie', and `z` is the count of 'mapie'. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters. After the function concludes, the input values remain unchanged, and the variables used within the function are reset for each test case.
