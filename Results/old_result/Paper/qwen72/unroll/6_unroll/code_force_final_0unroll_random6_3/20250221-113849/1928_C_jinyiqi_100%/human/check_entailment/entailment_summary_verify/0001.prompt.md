You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))
    print(len(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, followed by their corresponding complementary divisors. The input variable `x` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers assigned to students in a line repeat every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The pattern for the first \(k\) students is \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The pattern for the next \(k - 2\) students is \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - The pattern then repeats.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \(n\) and \(x\).
   - \(n\) is Vasya's position in the line.
   - \(x\) is the number Vasya received during the settling.
   - The output is the number of different \(k\) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Constraints:**
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - \(k > 1\)

4. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given \(k\), the pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The number \(x\) can appear in two different segments of the pattern:
     - In the first segment: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
     - In the second segment: \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\)

5. **Key Observations:**
   - If \(x\) is in the first segment, then \(x\) can be any number from 1 to \(k\).
   - If \(x\) is in the second segment, then \(x\) can be any number from 2 to \(k - 1\).

6. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For \(x\) in the first segment: \(n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2}\)
   - For \(x\) in the second segment: \(n \equiv 2k - 1 - x \pmod{2k - 2}\)

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \((n + x - 2) \mod 2 == 0\)
     - \((n - x) \mod 2 == 0\)
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \(x\).
   - It appends valid \(k\) values to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique `output` list.

8. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \(x\).
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.

9. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It correctly checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \(x\).
   - It correctly handles the constraints and the pattern described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem's constraints and pattern accurately.

Correctness: **True**
