Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping Through Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Contiguous Subarray Sum**:
   - The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum contiguous subarray sum. However, the implementation is flawed:
     - The variable `new_segment` is initialized as an empty list, and `max_segment` is initialized as `[0, 0]`.
     - The loop iterates through the array `arr` and attempts to update `new_segment` and `max_segment` based on whether the current element is positive or negative.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is incorrect. Specifically, the condition `if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]` is not sufficient to determine the maximum segment sum, and the way `max_segment` and `new_segment` are updated can lead to incorrect results.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` with the end index, but it does not handle the case where the last segment is positive correctly.
     - The final check to update `total_max_segment` is also flawed. It does not correctly identify the maximum segment sum and can return `[-1]` even when a valid segment exists.

3. **Calculating the Final Answer**:
   - The program calculates the final answer using the formula `answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the correct way to maximize the sum after `k` operations. The correct approach should involve finding the maximum subarray sum and then using it to maximize the overall sum after `k` operations.
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied using `func_1`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` is defined but not used in the program. It does not contribute to the solution and can be ignored.

Given the issues in the implementation of `func_2` and the incorrect formula used to calculate the final answer, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
