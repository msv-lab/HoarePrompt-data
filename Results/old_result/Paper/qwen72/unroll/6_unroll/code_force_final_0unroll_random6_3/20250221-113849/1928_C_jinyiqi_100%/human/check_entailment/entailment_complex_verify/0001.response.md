### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the numbers assigned to students in a line repeat every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The pattern for the first \(k\) students is \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\).
   - The pattern for the next \(k - 2\) students is \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\).
   - The pattern then repeats.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \(n\) and \(x\).
   - \(n\) is Vasya's position in the line.
   - \(x\) is the number Vasya received during the settling.
   - The output is the number of different \(k\) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Constraints:**
   - \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)
   - \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\)
   - \(k > 1\)

4. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - For a given \(k\), the pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - The number \(x\) can appear in two different segments of the pattern:
     - In the first segment: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, k\)
     - In the second segment: \(k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2\)

5. **Key Observations:**
   - If \(x\) is in the first segment, then \(x\) can be any number from 1 to \(k\).
   - If \(x\) is in the second segment, then \(x\) can be any number from 2 to \(k - 1\).

6. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - For \(x\) in the first segment: \(n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2}\)
   - For \(x\) in the second segment: \(n \equiv 2k - 1 - x \pmod{2k - 2}\)

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(x\).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \((n + x - 2) \mod 2 == 0\)
     - \((n - x) \mod 2 == 0\)
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \(x\).
   - It appends valid \(k\) values to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the unique `output` list.

8. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \(x\).
   - It returns a list of divisors in ascending order.
   - The function correctly identifies all divisors of \(x\) and returns them in the correct order.

9. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \(n + x - 2\) and \(n - x\).
   - It correctly checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and greater than or equal to \(x\).
   - It correctly handles the constraints and the pattern described in the problem.

10. **Annotated Code Validation:**
    - The annotations confirm that the program correctly identifies the divisors of \(x\) in `func_1`.
    - The program correctly checks the conditions \((n + x - 2) \mod 2 == 0\) and \((n - x) \mod 2 == 0\).
    - The program correctly appends valid \(k\) values to the `output` list and ensures uniqueness by converting the list to a set.

11. **Edge Cases:**
    - The program handles the edge case where \(k = 1\) is not valid.
    - The program correctly handles the constraints \(1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem's constraints and pattern accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
