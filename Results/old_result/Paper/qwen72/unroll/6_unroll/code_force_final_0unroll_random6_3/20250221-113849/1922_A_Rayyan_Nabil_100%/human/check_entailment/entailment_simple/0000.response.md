### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a template `t` such that:
     - For each position `i` in the strings `a` and `b`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - If `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
   - The string `c` should not match the template `t` at any position.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function `func_1(n, a, b, c)`:**
     - The function iterates over each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
     - It checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
     - If such an index is found, it returns 'YES'.
     - If no such index is found after the loop, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` ensures that for at least one position `i`, both `a` and `b` can match a template where `t[i]` is the uppercase version of `c[i]`.
   - This means that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, we can set `t[i]` to be the uppercase version of `c[i]`, and `a` and `b` will match this template, while `c` will not.
   - If no such position exists, then for every position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` (or both) is the same as `c[i]`, making it impossible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

4. **Function `func_2()`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to determine if a valid template exists.
   - It stores the results in a list and prints them after all test cases are processed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 20.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are the same string, as long as they differ from `c` at some position.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. The conditions and the loop logic are sound and cover all necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
