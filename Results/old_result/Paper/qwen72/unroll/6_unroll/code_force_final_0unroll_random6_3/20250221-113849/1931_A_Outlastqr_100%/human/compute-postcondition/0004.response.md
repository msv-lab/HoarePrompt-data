The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but lacks the actual parameters in the function definition. Based on the provided constraints, the function should accept an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it should accept an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= 78, representing the encoded word. However, the function definition does not specify these parameters. Assuming the function is intended to process these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 78) representing an encoded word. The function returns the decoded word for each test case.**
