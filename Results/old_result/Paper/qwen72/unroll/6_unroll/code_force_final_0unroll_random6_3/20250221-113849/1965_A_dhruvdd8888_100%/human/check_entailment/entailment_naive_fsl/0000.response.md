Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly identifying the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2
1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bob
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Alice
```

In this case, Alice must choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn because there is a pile of size 1. This leaves the piles as \( [0, 1] \). Bob can then choose \( k = 1 \) and empty the remaining pile, leaving Alice with no valid move. Therefore, Bob should win, but the program incorrectly outputs "Alice".
