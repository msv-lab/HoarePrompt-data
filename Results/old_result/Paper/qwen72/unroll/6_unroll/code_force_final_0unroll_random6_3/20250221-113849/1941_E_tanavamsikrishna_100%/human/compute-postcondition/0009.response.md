Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 1. It modifies the list `row` by setting `row[0]` to 1, incrementing each element in the range 1 to d-1 by 2, and then updating each element from index `d` to the end of the list based on the smallest element in a sliding window of the first `d` elements. Finally, it returns the last element of `row`, which is a non-negative integer updated based on the smallest element in the relevant window of the first `d` elements. **
