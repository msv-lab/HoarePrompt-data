Output State: **The loop has processed all the test cases and printed the results. The variables `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `k`, `q1`, `q2`, and `y` have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values are not retained for the next iteration. The loop completes its execution, and the program ends.**
