### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `T` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `T` times, each time reading two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - **If `a == b`:** This means both players have the same number of coins. Since both players play optimally, they will always end up in a situation where they have to remove the last coin from their wallets simultaneously, and the player who is forced to do this first will lose. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **If `a == 1`:** Alice has only one coin. She must remove this coin on her first turn, leaving her with an empty wallet. Bob will then win because Alice cannot make a move.
   - **If `b == 1`:** Bob has only one coin. Alice can swap wallets with Bob on her first turn, leaving Bob with an empty wallet. Bob will then lose because he cannot make a move.
   - **If `a % 2 == 1`:** Alice has an odd number of coins. The game will always end in a situation where the player with the odd number of coins will be forced to make the last move, which will result in a loss. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **If `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`:** Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins. Alice can always force Bob to be the one with the odd number of coins, and thus Bob will be forced to make the last move, resulting in a loss. Therefore, Alice wins.
   - **If `a > b`:** Alice has more coins than Bob. If both players have an even number of coins, Alice can always force Bob to be the one with the fewer coins, and thus Bob will be forced to make the last move, resulting in a loss. Therefore, Bob wins.
   - **Otherwise:** This covers the case where `a < b` and both have an even number of coins. Alice can always force Bob to be the one with the fewer coins, and thus Bob will be forced to make the last move, resulting in a loss. Therefore, Alice wins.

### Analysis of the Program:
- The program correctly handles the case where both players have the same number of coins (`a == b`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has only one coin (`a == 1`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Bob has only one coin (`b == 1`), and Alice wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has an odd number of coins (`a % 2 == 1`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins (`a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`), and Alice wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Alice has more coins than Bob (`a > b`), and Bob wins.
- The program correctly handles the case where Bob has more coins than Alice (`a < b`), and Alice wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
