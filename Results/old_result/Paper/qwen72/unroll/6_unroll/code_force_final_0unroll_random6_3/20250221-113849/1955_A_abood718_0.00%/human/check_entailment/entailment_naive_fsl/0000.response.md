Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the logic for printing the result when `A % 2 == 1` is incorrect. The program prints the number of pairs `X` and then calculates `X * C + B`, but it should directly print the total cost without printing `X`.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 5 9
```

**Expected Output:**
```
14
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
14
```

The program incorrectly prints `1` before the final result `14`. This extra print statement makes the output format incorrect and does not match the expected output format. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
