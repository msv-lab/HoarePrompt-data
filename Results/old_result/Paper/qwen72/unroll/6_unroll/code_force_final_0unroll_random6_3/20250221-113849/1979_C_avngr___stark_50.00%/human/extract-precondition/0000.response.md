It seems there is a mismatch in the function definition provided for the problem. The problem description is about a game involving betting coins on outcomes with specific multipliers, while the function definition `def func_1(numbers):` does not match this context. Based on the problem description, the correct function definition should be:

```python
def distribute_coins(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the integer `n` and a list of `n` multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.

Given this, the precondition for the function is:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20).**
