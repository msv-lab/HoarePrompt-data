The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26) from the input. It then prints a string that consists of the first `k` letters of the English alphabet repeated `n` times. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the state of the program includes the updated values of `n` and `k` based on the last test case, while `t` remains unchanged.
