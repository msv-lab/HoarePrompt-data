### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The program attempts to perform the operation on elements that are greater than 10 and out of order.
   - It checks if `list1[p - 1]` is greater than `list1[p]` and if `list1[p - 1]` is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits `list1[p - 1]` into its digits and inserts them back into the list.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After performing the operations, the program uses the `func_1` function to check if the array is sorted.
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the list `lst` is equal to its sorted version `sorted_lst`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements less than 10, as these elements are not modified.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program only performs the operation once for each element that is out of order and greater than 10. This might not be sufficient to ensure the array is sorted.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. After the first pass, the array becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. The program will not further split `28` because `2` is not greater than `28`. However, `28` should be split to `[2, 8]` to make the array sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only performs the operation once for each out-of-order element, which is insufficient.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
