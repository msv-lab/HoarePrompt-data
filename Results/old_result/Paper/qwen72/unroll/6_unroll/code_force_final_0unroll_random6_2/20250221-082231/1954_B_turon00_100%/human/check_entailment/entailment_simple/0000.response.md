### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal but not necessarily incorrect in this context. The function reads inputs directly from `stdin`, which is a common practice in competitive programming.
   - The function correctly handles the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `n` for each test case.

2. **Initialization and Logic:**
   - The variable `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a`. This is used to track the first element of the array.
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the array. This variable will store the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Loop and Consecutive Element Counting:**
   - The loop iterates through the array `a` and counts the number of consecutive elements that are the same as `tmp`.
   - If a different element is encountered, the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` is updated, and `cnt` is reset to 0.
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

4. **Output Conditions:**
   - If `n` is 1 or if `ans` is equal to `n`, the function prints `-1`. This is correct because:
     - If `n` is 1, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
     - If `ans` is equal to `n`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and removing any number of elements will still leave the array beautiful.
   - Otherwise, the function prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the array has only one element.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same.

6. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element and updates the answer accordingly.
   - The logic ensures that the array is checked for beauty and the minimum number of elements to remove is calculated.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful, and it handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.
