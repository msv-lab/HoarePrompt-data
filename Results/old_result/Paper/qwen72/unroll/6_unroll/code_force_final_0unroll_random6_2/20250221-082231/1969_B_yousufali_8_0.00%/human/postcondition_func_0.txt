The function does not accept any parameters. It reads a binary string from the standard input, converts it to a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans` based on the pattern of 1s and 0s in the list. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each sequence of 1s followed by a 0, where `n` is the count of consecutive 1s in that sequence. The function then prints the value of `ans`. The list `s` remains unchanged after the function execution.
