Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where all elements in the array are negative correctly. According to the problem description, if all elements are negative, the optimal strategy is to take an empty subarray in each operation, which does not change the sum of the array. However, the program incorrectly calculates a positive `maxi` value in such cases, leading to an incorrect final result.

Example case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```
Expected output:
```
-6
```
Actual output:
```
1000000001
```
The program should output `-6` (or `1000000001` modulo \(10^9 + 7\)), but it outputs `1000000001`, which is incorrect.
