Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case with the first element being an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5) and the second element being a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.
