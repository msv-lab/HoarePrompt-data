### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input correctly. The first line is ignored (likely the length of the list, which is not used explicitly in the code), and the second line is split and converted to a list of integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to find the optimal range `[r, l]` that maximizes the sum of the elements outside the range plus the square of the length of the range.
   - The logic is to iterate over all possible sublists and calculate the potential sum if the MEX of the sublist is applied to all elements in the sublist.
   - The function correctly updates `r` and `l` with the indices of the optimal sublist and returns them.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop continues to apply the optimal operation found by `func_1` until `r` equals `l`.
   - The `func_3` function is called to update the list and record the operations.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` with the MEX value of the sublist, which is the length of the sublist `n = l - r + 1`.
   - The function appends the operation to `ops` and updates the sublist in `lst`.
   - The function also recursively applies operations to ensure the sublist is updated correctly.

5. **Final 0 Handling:**
   - After the main loop, the program attempts to replace all remaining zeros in the list with ones. This is done using a `try` block to catch the `ValueError` when `0` is no longer in the list.
   - This step ensures that the sum is maximized by converting all zeros to ones, as zeros are the smallest non-negative integers that can be replaced.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final sum of the list and the number of operations.
   - It then prints each operation.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Function `func_2` is not used correctly:**
  - The function `func_2` is defined but not used correctly in the main loop. It is called within `func_3`, but the recursive calls and the logic inside `func_2` do not seem to contribute to the solution. This function appears to be redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

- **Redundant Operations in `func_3`:**
  - The function `func_3` appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary. The operation should be appended only once after the sublist is updated.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX calculation is not explicitly shown in the code. The function `func_1` assumes that the MEX of the sublist is the length of the sublist, which is not always correct. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sublist.

### Conclusion:
The program has logical issues in the way it handles the MEX calculation and the operations. The function `func_2` is redundant, and the operations in `func_3` are not necessary. The MEX calculation is also incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****

The program does not correctly implement the MEX operation and the sequence of operations to maximize the sum of the array. The logic for finding the optimal range and updating the array is flawed.
