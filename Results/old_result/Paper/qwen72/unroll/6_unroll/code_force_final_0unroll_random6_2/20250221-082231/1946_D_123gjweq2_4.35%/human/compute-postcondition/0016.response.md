Output State: **The program returns -1 or the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`, depending on whether the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1 or 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `xor` is 0.
- The bit-th bit of `xor` (which is 0) is 0.
- Since the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, `thing1` is set to the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
- The program returns `thing1`, which is the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`. However, if the bit-th bit of `xor` were 1, `thing1` would be -1. Since `xor` is 0, the program returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
