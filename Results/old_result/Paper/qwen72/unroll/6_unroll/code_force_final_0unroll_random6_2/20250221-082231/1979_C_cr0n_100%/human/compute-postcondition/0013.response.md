Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer `N` and a list of `N` integers `vals` from user input. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in `vals` and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the GCD divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. If the GCD minus the sum of the elements in `vprod` is less than or equal to zero, the function prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces. The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. The list `vals` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
