#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. The input must be provided in a structured format, typically through standard input or a predefined input method, as the function itself does not take any parameters. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0, as the loop has processed all `t` test cases. The variables `n` and `a` will be undefined or will hold the values from the last test case processed, but these values will not be used further. The variable `res` will hold the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) for the last test case processed, and this value will be printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` with elements 0 or 1, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free or contain a chip. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the ribbon. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` will be 0, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `res` will hold the values from the last test case processed, but these values will not be used further.
