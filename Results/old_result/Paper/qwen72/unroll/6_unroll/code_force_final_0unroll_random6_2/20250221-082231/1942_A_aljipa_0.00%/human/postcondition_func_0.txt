The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the length of an array and `k` is a parameter. If `k` equals `n`, it prints an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the output will be the printed results for each test case.
