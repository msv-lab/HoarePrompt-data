Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is beautiful and can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1` because removing the last element (index 4) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is no longer beautiful. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove.

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, where it tries to find the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it should focus on finding the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.
