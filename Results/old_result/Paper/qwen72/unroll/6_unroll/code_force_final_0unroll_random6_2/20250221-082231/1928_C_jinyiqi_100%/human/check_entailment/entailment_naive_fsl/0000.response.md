Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - It appends both `i` and `x // i` to the list of divisors.
   - It reverses the first list of divisors and concatenates it with the second list to ensure all divisors are included.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions: `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of the respective value.
   - It then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values:
     - `k` must be even and greater than or equal to `x`.
     - `(s + 2) / 2` is used to convert the divisor `s` to a potential `k` value.
   - It collects all valid `k` values in the `output` list, ensures they are unique by converting the list to a set, and then prints the length of the set.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` must be greater than 1.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
