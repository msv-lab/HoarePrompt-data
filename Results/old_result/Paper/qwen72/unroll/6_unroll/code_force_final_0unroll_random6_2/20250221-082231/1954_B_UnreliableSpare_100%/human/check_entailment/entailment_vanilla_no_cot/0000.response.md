Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program has a logical flaw in how it determines the minimum number of elements to remove to stop the array from being beautiful. The logic in `func_1()` checks if all elements in the array are the same and, if so, prints `-1`. However, the part where it tries to find the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`arr[0]`), and then tries to find the minimum count of such consecutive elements. This approach does not correctly solve the problem because it does not consider the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements that are not part of the longest sequence of identical elements.

Here's a corrected version of the logic:

1. If all elements are the same, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, so the answer is `-1`.
2. If the array is not all the same, the goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same. This means finding the smallest sequence of elements that can be removed to break the pattern where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` for any `i`.

A more appropriate approach would be to:

1. Check if all elements are the same.
2. If not, find the minimum number of elements to remove by looking for the smallest subarray that, when removed, breaks the pattern of the beautiful array.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if all elements are the same
    if len(set(arr)) == 1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if arr[i - 1] == arr[i + 1]:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
            else:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, 2)
        
        # If the array is already non-beautiful, no removals are needed
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            print(0)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()
```

This version correctly handles the cases where the array is all the same and where it is not, and it finds the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful pattern.
