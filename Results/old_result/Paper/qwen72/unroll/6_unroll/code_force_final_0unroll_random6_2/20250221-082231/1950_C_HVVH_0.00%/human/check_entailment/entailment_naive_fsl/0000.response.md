Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the transition between AM and PM. Specifically, the logic for setting `day` to 'AM' or 'PM' is incorrect. For example, when the input is "12:14", the program will output "12:14 PM" instead of "12:14 PM" as expected. The issue lies in the following block:

```python
else:
    day = 'PM'
    if h == 12:
        day = 'AM'
```

This block incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for all hours between 1 and 11, and then changes it back to 'AM' if the hour is 12. This results in incorrect output for times like "12:14" and "00:59". The correct logic should be:

```python
if h == 0:
    h = 12
    day = 'AM'
elif h == 12:
    day = 'PM'
elif h > 12:
    h = h - 12
    day = 'PM'
else:
    day = 'AM'
```
