Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains multiple elements that are the same, and these elements are the smallest non-negative integers. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
0 0 0 1 1 1
```

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 0, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 0, `a = [0, 1, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 1, `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 0, `a = [1, 1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
5. Alice picks 1, `a = [1]`, `c = [0, 1, 1]`.
6. Bob picks 1, `a = []`, `c = [0, 1, 1]`.

The MEX of `c` is 2, but the program will output 0 because it incorrectly assumes that if a number appears only once, it should be included in the MEX calculation. This logic fails to consider the optimal strategy where both players can choose the same number multiple times, leading to an incorrect MEX calculation.
