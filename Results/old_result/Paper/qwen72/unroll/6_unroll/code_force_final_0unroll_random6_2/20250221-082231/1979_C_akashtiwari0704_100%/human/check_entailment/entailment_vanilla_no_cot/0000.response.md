Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **LCM Calculation**: The function `lcm` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the list `a`, which contains the multipliers for each outcome. This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, the program calculates the bet as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is a multiple of the LCM, which is a key part of the solution.

4. **Sum of Bets**: The program sums up the calculated bets and checks if the total sum is less than the LCM. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating that there is no valid distribution of coins. Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets.

5. **Output Formatting**: The program correctly formats the output as a space-separated list of integers for each test case.

The logic ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
