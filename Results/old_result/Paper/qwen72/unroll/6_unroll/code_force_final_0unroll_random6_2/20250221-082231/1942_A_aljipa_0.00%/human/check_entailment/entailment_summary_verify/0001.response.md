### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) of its cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - The elements of the array must satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Special Cases:**
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**
     - If \( k = n \), all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This is only possible if the array is constant (i.e., all elements are the same).
     - The program constructs an array with all elements equal to 1, which is correct.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**
     - If \( k = 1 \), exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This can be achieved by creating an array where the elements are in strictly increasing order, except for one element that is much larger than the others.
     - The program constructs an array with elements in the range \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \). However, this is not strictly correct because the elements should be within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The correct approach would be to use a large number for one element, such as \( 10^9 \), to ensure the array is not sorted in any other cyclic shift.
   - **Case 3: \( 1 < k < n \)**
     - If \( 1 < k < n \), it is not possible to construct an array that has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. This is because if an array has more than one sorted cyclic shift, it implies that the array must have a repeating pattern or be constant, which would result in either all shifts being sorted or none being sorted.
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) in this case.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly handles the special cases:
     - For \( k = n \), it constructs an array with all elements equal to 1.
     - For \( k = 1 \), it constructs an array with elements in the range \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), but this is not the optimal solution as it does not ensure the elements are within the required range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
     - For any other \( k \), it outputs \(-1\).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Case \( k = n \):**
     - The array \( [1, 1, \ldots, 1] \) is indeed sorted in all cyclic shifts.
   - **Case \( k = 1 \):**
     - The array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is sorted only in its original form, but the elements should be within the range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). A better solution would be to use a large number for one element, such as \( 10^9 \), to ensure the array is not sorted in any other cyclic shift.
   - **Case \( 1 < k < n \):**
     - The program correctly outputs \(-1\) because no such array exists.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct but has a minor issue in the case where \( k = 1 \). The array constructed should use a large number to ensure the elements are within the required range \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). However, the program's logic for handling the cases is sound.

Final: **False**

The program needs a slight modification to handle the case where \( k = 1 \) correctly by ensuring the elements are within the required range. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(1, n)) + [10**9]
        else:
            res = [-1]
        print(*res)
```

This corrected version ensures that the elements are within the required range and the program is now correct for all cases.
