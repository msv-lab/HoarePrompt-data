The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers, where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters. However, the specific output conditions are not provided in the example. Assuming the function processes these parameters to return a specific value or list based on the constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers, each between 1 and `n` and not equal to its index. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.**
