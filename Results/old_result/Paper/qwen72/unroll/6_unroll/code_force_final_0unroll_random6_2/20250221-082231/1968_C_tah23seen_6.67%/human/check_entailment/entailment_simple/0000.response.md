### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of length `n-1` where each element is between 1 and 500.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element of `ans` to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2`, which is necessary for the modulo operation to work correctly.
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-3` (inclusive), setting `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = arr[i]` for all `2 \le i \le n-1`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that the modulo condition is satisfied for the next element in the sequence.
   - Finally, it sets `ans[n-1]` to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-2]`. This ensures that the last element in `ans` satisfies the modulo condition with the second-to-last element.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which should satisfy the given conditions.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **Condition 1:** \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
  - The initial value `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` is always greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(10^9\) since `arr[0]` is between 1 and 500.
  - The subsequent values in `ans` are constructed by adding `arr[i]` to `ans[i]`, and if necessary, by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` to ensure the value is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that all values in `ans` are within the valid range.

- **Condition 2:** \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).
  - The loop ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is always greater than `arr[i]` and is constructed such that `ans[i + 1] \bmod ans[i] = arr[i]`.
  - The final element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-2]`, which ensures that `ans[n-1] \bmod ans[n-2] = arr[n-2]`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. In this case, the loop is not executed, and the function directly sets `ans[0]` and `ans[1]` to satisfy the conditions.
- The program also handles the case where `arr` contains large values (up to 500) and ensures that the values in `ans` are within the valid range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that the given conditions are satisfied for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
