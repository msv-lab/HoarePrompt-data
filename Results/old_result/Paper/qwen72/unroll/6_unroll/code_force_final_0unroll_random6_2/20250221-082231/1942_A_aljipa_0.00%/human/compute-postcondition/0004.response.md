The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is the length of the array, and `k` is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3. The function should handle up to 10^3 test cases. The function returns the array after performing `k` sorted cyclic shifts on it.
