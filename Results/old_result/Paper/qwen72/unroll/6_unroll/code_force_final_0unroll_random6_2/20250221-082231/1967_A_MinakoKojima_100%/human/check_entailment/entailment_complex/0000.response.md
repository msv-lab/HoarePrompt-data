### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to determine the minimum number of cards of any type and then incrementally increase the count of cards to maximize the score.

3. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to the smallest number of cards of any type (`a[0]`).
   - The variable `res` is initialized to `n - 1`, which represents the number of positions that can be filled to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Incremental Adjustment**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list `a` and calculates the difference `dif` between consecutive elements.
   - If `dif` is zero, it means the current and next elements are the same, and `res` is decremented.
   - If `dif` is non-zero, the function checks if there are enough coins (`k`) to make the current element equal to the next element. If so, it adjusts `ans` and `k` accordingly and decrements `res`.
   - If there are not enough coins to make the adjustment, it calculates the maximum possible increase in `ans` using the remaining coins and updates `res` and `k`.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - If there are still coins left after the loop, the function uses them to further increase `ans` by `k // n` and adjusts `res` by `k % n`.
   - The final score is calculated by adding the number of complete permutations (`(ans - 1) * (n - 1)`) and the remaining positions (`res`).

6. **Output**:
   - The function appends the final score to `ans_list` and prints each score for the test cases.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the function is designed to maximize the number of cards that can be made equal by spending the available coins.
- The sorting step ensures that the function can efficiently determine the minimum number of cards and incrementally adjust the counts.
- The loop and the final adjustments correctly handle the distribution of coins to maximize the score.
- The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output format.
