You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in `a`. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using the `cnt` dictionary. The loop variable `t` is used to track the number of unique integers that appear exactly once in `a`. The loop prints the first integer `i` that either appears exactly once (incrementing `t` each time such an integer is found) or is missing from `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`), and breaks out of the loop if `t` reaches 2 or if a missing integer is found. After all iterations, the variables `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt`, and `t` will have been modified as described, but the input variable `input()` remains unchanged as it is a built-in function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. For each test case, it reads `N` and the list `a`, counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`, and then prints the first integer `i` (0 <= i < N) that either appears exactly once in `a` or is missing from `a`. If two unique integers are found that appear exactly once, it prints the first such integer and breaks out of the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the input variables `a` and `N` are consumed, and the function has no side effects on external state other than printing the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to a new array `c`, while Bob simply removes it.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she will try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he will try to remove elements that Alice might need to maximize the MEX.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - If an element appears more than once in `a`, Alice can always choose one of them, and Bob can only remove one.
   - If an element appears exactly once, Alice and Bob will both have a chance to pick it, but Alice will always pick it first if it is the smallest such element.
   - The game ends when all elements are removed from `a`.

4. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the possible values from 0 to `N-1` (since the elements are in the range `[0, N-1]`).
   - For each value `i`, it checks:
     - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it increments a counter `t` by 1.
     - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i] == 0`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The logic of the program is to find the smallest integer `i` that either:
     - Does not appear in `a` (i.e., `cnt[i] == 0`).
     - Appears exactly once, and Alice and Bob have already picked another unique element (i.e., `t >= 2`).
   - This ensures that the MEX is correctly identified because:
     - If `cnt[i] == 0`, `i` is the smallest integer not in `a` and thus not in `c`.
     - If `t >= 2`, it means that Alice and Bob have already picked two unique elements, and the next smallest integer that is not in `c` is `i`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are unique and the case where some elements are repeated.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all the necessary cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
