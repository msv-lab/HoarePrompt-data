Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider overlapping occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map". For example, consider the string "pipie". The program will only count the first "pie" and will not recognize the second "pie" that overlaps with the first one. This results in an incorrect output.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:
- The string "pipie" contains two overlapping "pie" substrings.
- The program will only remove the first "pie" and will not recognize the second one, leading to an incorrect output of 1 instead of 2.

To fix this, the program should handle overlapping substrings correctly.
