Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX**: The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from the array `a` until it is empty. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c` (which she builds), while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: To determine the optimal strategy, consider the following:
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest possible integers by removing them from `a`.

3. **Frequency Analysis**: The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each integer in the array `arr` and stores it in the list `freq`. This is a crucial step because it helps in determining which integers are available and how many times they appear.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - If an integer `i` appears at least twice in `arr`, it is ignored (since it will be removed by Bob).
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, `cou` is incremented.
   - If `cou` reaches 2 or if an integer `i` does not appear at all in `arr`, the loop prints `i` and breaks.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The loop correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either does not appear in `arr` or is the second unique integer that appears exactly once.
   - This logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players:
     - Alice will try to include the smallest integers in `c` that are not removed by Bob.
     - Bob will try to remove the smallest integers to minimize the MEX.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in `arr` by printing `n` (since `n` is the smallest integer not in the range [0, n-1]).
   - The function also handles the case where some integers appear multiple times and others do not appear at all.

7. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct MEX for each test case, as per the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.

Correctness: **True**
