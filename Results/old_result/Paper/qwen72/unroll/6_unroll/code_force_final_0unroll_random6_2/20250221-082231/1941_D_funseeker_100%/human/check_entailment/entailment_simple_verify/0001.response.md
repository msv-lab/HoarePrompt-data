### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the input, which is efficient and appropriate for handling large inputs.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers. This is consistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop. This is correct as per the problem description.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

4. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over the `m` throws.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly. This is a crucial part of the program and is implemented correctly.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, as player `0` is the same as player `n` in a 1-indexed circle.
   - This adjustment is necessary because the problem specifies that players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and the modulo operation can result in `0` which should be converted to `n`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players in the set and the sorted list of player numbers. This matches the required output format.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program correctly handles the problem as described. It correctly parses the input, processes each throw, and updates the set of possible positions. The final adjustments to handle the 1-indexed circle are also correct. The output format matches the problem description, and the program ensures that all possible positions are considered.

### Additional Considerations:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n` is 2 correctly. For example, if `n = 2`, the only possible positions are 1 and 2, and the program will correctly output these.
  - The program also handles the case where `c` is '?' correctly by considering both possible directions for each throw.

- **Performance:**
  - The use of sets to keep track of possible positions is efficient and appropriate given the constraints.
  - The program's time complexity is O(m * n) in the worst case, which is manageable given the constraints (n * m <= 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
