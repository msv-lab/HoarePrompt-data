The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and the list `a` contains `n` integers, each in the range `1 <= a_i <= n`. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

The function returns the result of processing each test case. The exact output for each test case is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes the list `a` in some way and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
