The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m` is an integer representing the size of the window to be considered in list `a`.
- `k` is an integer representing the threshold for the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers, where each integer `b_i` is between 1 and 10^6.

The function returns the number of windows of size `m` in list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the window and list `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
