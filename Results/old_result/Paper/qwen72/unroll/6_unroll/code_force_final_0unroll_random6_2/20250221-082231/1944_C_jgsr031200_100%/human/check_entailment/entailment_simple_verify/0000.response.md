### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. However, the program's approach to calculating the MEX is not entirely wrong; it just doesn't align with the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

Let's break down the program and the annotations:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a frequency list `freq` of length `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - It correctly updates the frequency list based on the elements in `arr`.

3. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program then iterates through the frequency list to find the first integer `i` where `freq[i] == 0` or the second integer `i` where `freq[i] == 1`.
   - The logic here is to find the smallest integer that is either missing from `arr` or appears only once, which is a valid approach to finding the MEX in a simplified scenario.

However, the problem requires both players to play optimally, and the program does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob. Specifically:

- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
  - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
  - The optimal strategy involves both players making choices that influence the final composition of `c` to achieve their respective goals.

### Counterexample Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

- **Optimal Play:**
  - Alice should pick the middle value (2) first, as it helps in maximizing the MEX.
  - Bob will then pick the smallest value (0) to minimize the MEX.
  - Alice will pick the next middle value (3).
  - Bob will pick the next smallest value (1).
  - Alice will pick the remaining value (4).

  The final array `c` will be `[2, 3, 4]`, and the MEX of `c` is 1.

- **Program Output:**
  - The program will output `0` because it simply finds the first integer that is missing from `arr` or appears only once, without considering the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program's approach to finding the MEX is not aligned with the optimal play strategy required by the problem. The program does not simulate the game correctly and does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
