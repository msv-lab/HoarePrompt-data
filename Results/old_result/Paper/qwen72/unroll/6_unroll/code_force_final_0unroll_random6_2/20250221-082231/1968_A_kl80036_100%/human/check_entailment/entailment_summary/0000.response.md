Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The key insight here is that for any integer \( x \), the value \( y = x - 1 \) will always have \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \) because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and the greatest common divisor of any two consecutive integers is always 1.

Given this, the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) simplifies to \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \). This is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( y \) is maximized at \( x - 1 \) and \( \gcd(x, y) \) is 1.

The program correctly implements this logic by:
1. Reading the number of test cases \( t \).
2. For each test case, reading the integer \( x \).
3. Calculating \( y = x - 1 \).
4. Printing \( y \) for each test case.

Since the program follows the correct logic and produces the expected output for the given problem, it is correct.

Correctness: **True**
