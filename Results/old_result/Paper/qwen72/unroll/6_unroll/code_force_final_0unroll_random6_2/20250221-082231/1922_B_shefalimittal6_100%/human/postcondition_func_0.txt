The function reads input from the standard input stream, processes a series of test cases, and prints the results. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function calculates the number of ways to choose 2 or 3 identical elements from the list of integers for each test case and prints these counts, one per line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, `data` remains a list of strings obtained from the input, `idx` is the index after the last processed element in `data`, and `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
