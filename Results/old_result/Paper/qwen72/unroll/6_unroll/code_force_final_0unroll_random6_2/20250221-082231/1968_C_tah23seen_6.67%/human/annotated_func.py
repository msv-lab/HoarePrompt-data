#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), and n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a list of length `n` where `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` and for all 1 <= i < n-1, `ans[i]` is the cumulative sum of `arr` values from index 0 to i, adjusted to be greater than `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[n-1]` is not modified by the loop.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, for all 1 <= i < n-1, `ans[i]` is the cumulative sum of `arr` values from index 0 to i, adjusted to be greater than `arr[i]`, and `ans[n-1]` is `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the middle elements (from index 1 to n-2) are cumulative sums of `arr` values from index 0 to the current index, adjusted to be greater than the corresponding `arr` elements, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
