Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `row[0]` and `row[m-1]`**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `row[0]` to 1, but it should be 1 because the cost of installing a support in the first column is `a_{i,1} + 1`, and `a_{i,1}` is always 0. Similarly, the cost of installing a support in the last column should be `a_{i,m} + 1`, which is also 1. However, the function does not handle the last column correctly.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation for Initial Columns**:
   - The function `func_1` adds 2 to the cost of the first `d` columns, which is incorrect. The cost of installing a support in any cell `(i, j)` should be `a_{i,j} + 1`.

3. **Heap Management**:
   - The heap management in `func_1` is not correctly handling the removal of elements that are too far away. The condition `e[1] <= i - (d + 2)` is incorrect. It should be `e[1] < i - d` to ensure that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

4. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` returns `row[-1]`, which is the cost of the last column. However, the last column should always have a support installed, and the cost should be 1. The function should return the total cost of the supports installed in the row, not just the cost of the last column.

5. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for each test case but does not handle the multiple test cases correctly. It should be wrapped in a loop to handle each test case separately.

### Corrected Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from heapq import heapify, heappop, heappush

def func_1(row, d: int):
    n = len(row)
    dp = [float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 1  # Cost of installing a support in the first column
    min_heap = [(1, 0)]  # Initialize the heap with the first column cost

    for j in range(1, n):
        while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < j - d:
            heappop(min_heap)
        cost = row[j] + 1
        dp[j] = cost + min_heap[0][0]
        heappush(min_heap, (dp[j], j))

    return dp[-1]  # Return the cost of the last column

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - (k - 1))]
        print(min(total_costs))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0]` is set to 1 because the cost of installing a support in the first column is always 1.
   - `min_heap` is initialized with the cost of the first column.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each cell `j` in the row, the cost of installing a support is `row[j] + 1`.
   - The minimum cost to reach cell `j` is the cost of installing a support in cell `j` plus the minimum cost of any support within the last `d` columns.
   - The heap is used to efficiently keep track of the minimum cost within the last `d` columns.

3. **Final Cost**:
   - The function returns `dp[-1]`, which is the minimum total cost of installing supports in the row.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func_2` is wrapped in a loop to handle multiple test cases.

This corrected solution should work correctly for the given problem.
