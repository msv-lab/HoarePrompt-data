Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by reading the input, processing each test case, and calculating the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Pair Selection and Removal**:
   - The program attempts to remove elements from the list using `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])`. This is incorrect because `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which do not correctly index the elements to be removed. Instead, it should remove the first two elements of the list in each iteration.
   - The correct way to remove the first two elements is to use `lst.pop(0)` twice or to slice the list.

2. **Inefficient Pair Selection**:
   - The program does not sort the list before processing it, which means it does not always select the optimal pairs to maximize the score. To maximize the score, you should always pair the smallest elements together. Sorting the list and then summing the first half of the sorted list will achieve this.

3. **Incorrect Loop Condition**:
   - The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not necessary and can be simplified. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, as each iteration processes a pair of elements.

4. **Redundant Break Statement**:
   - The `break` statement in the `else` block is unnecessary because the loop will naturally terminate after `n` iterations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

Explanation:
- **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Sorting the List**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order.
- **Summing the Minimum Values**: The sum of the first `n` elements of the sorted list is calculated, which corresponds to the minimum values of the pairs.
- **Appending and Printing Results**: The result for each test case is appended to `ans_f` and printed at the end.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
