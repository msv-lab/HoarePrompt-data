The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of the function `func` and the variables `a` and `n` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, to ensure the loop can run, we need to specify that the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
