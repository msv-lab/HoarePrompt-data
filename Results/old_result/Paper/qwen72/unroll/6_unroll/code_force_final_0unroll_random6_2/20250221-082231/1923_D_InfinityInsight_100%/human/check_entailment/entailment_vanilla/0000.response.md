### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a specific size.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the slimes and calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`**
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   - If the found index corresponds to an element equal to `x`, it returns the index + 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the index.

4. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - Initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of prefix sums and the last index of a different size.
   - Initializes `ans` list to store the result for each slime, initially set to -1.
   - Iterates through the slimes to update the `last` list with the last index of a different size.
   - Updates the `left` list with the prefix sums of the sizes.
   - For each slime, checks if it can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - If not, calculates the minimum time it can be eaten by a larger slime to the left using `func_1`.
   - Updates the `ans` list with the calculated time.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The `left` list correctly calculates the prefix sums of the sizes.
   - **Last Index of Different Size:** The `last` list correctly tracks the last index of a different size to the left.
   - **Eating Condition:** The program correctly checks if a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - **Minimum Time Calculation:** The program uses binary search to find the minimum time a slime can be eaten by a larger slime to the left, which is a valid approach.
   - **Handling Impossible Cases:** The program correctly handles cases where a slime cannot be eaten by setting the result to -1.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where all slimes have the same size.
   - The program should handle cases where the slimes are in a strictly increasing or decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum time for each slime to be eaten or reporting -1 if it is impossible. The use of prefix sums and binary search is appropriate for the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
