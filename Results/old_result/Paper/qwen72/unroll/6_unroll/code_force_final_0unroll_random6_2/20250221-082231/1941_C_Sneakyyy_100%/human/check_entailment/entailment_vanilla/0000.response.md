### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - We need to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure these substrings do not appear.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the number of characters to be removed.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the string `a` with an index `i`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the substring `a[i:i+3]` is either "map" or "pie".
     - If it is, it increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1, indicating that 3 characters are removed.
     - If it is not, it increments `i` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program correctly identifies the substrings "map" and "pie" and increments the index by 3 when found.
   - However, the program only increments `ans` by 1 for each occurrence of "map" or "pie", which is incorrect. Each occurrence of "map" or "pie" requires the removal of 3 characters, not 1.
   - The program should increment `ans` by 3 instead of 1 when a substring "map" or "pie" is found.

4. **Correcting the Program**:
   - Change the line `ans += 1` to `ans += 3` to correctly count the number of characters removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 3  # Corrected line
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly count the number of characters to be removed.
- The corrected program increments `ans` by 3 for each occurrence of "map" or "pie", which is the correct approach.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
