Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list `total_max_segment`. If `arr` does not contain any positive segment, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` contains the sum of the maximum positive segment found in `arr`, the index of the first element in that segment, the index of the last element in that segment, and the value `len(arr) - 1`. **
