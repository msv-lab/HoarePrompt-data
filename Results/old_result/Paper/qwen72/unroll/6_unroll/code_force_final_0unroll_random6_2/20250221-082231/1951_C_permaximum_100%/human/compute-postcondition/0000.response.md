Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), `prices` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index.**

Explanation:
- The code creates a new list `pq` using a list comprehension.
- Each element in `pq` is a tuple `(price, i)`, where `price` is an element from the `prices` list and `i` is its index.
- The list `pq` will have the same number of elements as `prices`, and each element in `pq` will be a tuple containing the price and its index.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remain unchanged.
