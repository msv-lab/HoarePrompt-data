### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the size of the chessboard `n` based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.

2. **Board Size Update:**
   - If the move is not on the diagonal (i.e., `a != b`), the program reduces `n` by 2, which is correct because both the row and column are blocked by the rooks.
   - If the move is on the diagonal (i.e., `a == b`), the program reduces `n` by 1, which is correct because only one row (or column) is blocked by the rook.

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which represents the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The DP transition is correctly implemented as `dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]`. This transition accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on a reduced board size.
   - The `dp.pop(0)` operation ensures that the DP array always contains the last two values needed for the next calculation.

4. **Output:**
   - The program returns `dp[-1]`, which is the correct value for the number of possible final configurations for the given `n`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input, updates the board size based on the moves, and uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The DP transition and modulo operation are also correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
