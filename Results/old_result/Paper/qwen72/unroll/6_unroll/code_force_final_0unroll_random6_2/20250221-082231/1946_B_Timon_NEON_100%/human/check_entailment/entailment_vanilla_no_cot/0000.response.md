Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incomplete and does not fully solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function 3 is incomplete**: The function `func_3` is supposed to calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, but it is not implemented. The function currently only initializes `answer` to 0 and does nothing else.

2. **Function 2 logic is flawed**: The function `func_2` is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but the logic is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains both positive and negative numbers, and it does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray.

3. **Modulo operation**: The function `func_1` is used to return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but it is not used in the context of the problem. The modulo operation should be applied to the final result of the maximum sum after `k` operations.

4. **Handling multiple test cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. It lacks a loop to process each test case and output the results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- Use this maximum sum to perform the operations and calculate the final maximum sum after `k` operations.
- Apply the modulo operation to the final result.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_subarray_sum(arr):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    current_sum = 0
    for num in arr:
        current_sum = max(num, current_sum + num)
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

def max_array_sum_after_operations(n, k, arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    max_subarray = max_subarray_sum(arr)
    if max_subarray <= 0:
        return func_1(total_sum)
    else:
        return func_1(total_sum + max_subarray * k)

def func_1(number):
    return number % 1000000007

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(max_array_sum_after_operations(n, k, arr))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **max_subarray_sum**: This function uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
2. **max_array_sum_after_operations**: This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the total sum of the array remains unchanged. Otherwise, the maximum subarray sum is added `k` times to the total sum.
3. **func_1**: This function returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
4. **Main loop**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case, printing the result for each.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
