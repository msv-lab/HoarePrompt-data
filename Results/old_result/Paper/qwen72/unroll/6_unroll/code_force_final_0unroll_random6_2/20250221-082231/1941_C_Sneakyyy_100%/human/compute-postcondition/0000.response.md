The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is influenced by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. The state of `t`, `n`, and `s` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the initial state provided. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input to the loop is a positive integer, which will be the number of iterations the loop will run.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, `s` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6, and `int(input())` must be a positive integer (at least 1).**
