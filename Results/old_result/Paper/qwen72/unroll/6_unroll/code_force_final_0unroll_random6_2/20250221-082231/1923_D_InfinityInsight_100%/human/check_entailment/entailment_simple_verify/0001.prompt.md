You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a line of slimes, each with a specific size.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to find the index of the smallest element in the prefix sum array `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the slimes and calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a, x)`**
   - This function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1.
   - If the found index corresponds to an element equal to `x`, it returns the index + 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the index.

4. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - Initializes `left` and `last` lists to keep track of prefix sums and the last index of a different size.
   - Initializes `ans` list to store the result for each slime, initially set to -1.
   - Iterates through the slimes to update the `last` list with the last index of a different size.
   - Updates the `left` list with the prefix sums of the sizes.
   - For each slime, checks if it can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - If not, calculates the minimum time it can be eaten by a larger slime to the left using `func_1`.
   - Updates the `ans` list with the calculated time.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation:** The `left` list correctly calculates the prefix sums of the sizes.
   - **Last Index of Different Size:** The `last` list correctly tracks the last index of a different size to the left.
   - **Eating Condition:** The program correctly checks if a slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in the next second.
   - **Minimum Time Calculation:** The program uses binary search to find the minimum time a slime can be eaten by a larger slime to the left, which is a valid approach.
   - **Handling Impossible Cases:** The program correctly handles cases where a slime cannot be eaten by setting the result to -1.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where all slimes have the same size.
   - The program should handle cases where the slimes are in a strictly increasing or decreasing order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum time for each slime to be eaten or reporting -1 if it is impossible. The use of prefix sums and binary search is appropriate for the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
