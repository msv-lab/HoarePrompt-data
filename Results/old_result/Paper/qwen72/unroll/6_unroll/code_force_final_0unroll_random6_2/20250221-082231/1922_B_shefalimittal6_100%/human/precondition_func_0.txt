t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) with n being an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and a being a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
