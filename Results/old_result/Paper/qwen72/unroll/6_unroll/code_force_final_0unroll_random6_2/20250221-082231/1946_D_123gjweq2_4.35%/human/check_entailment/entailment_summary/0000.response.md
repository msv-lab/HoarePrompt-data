Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of segments `k` such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`. The solution provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `find_max`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - However, `func_1` does not use the parameter `x` at all, which is crucial for the problem. This suggests that the function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem.

2. **Function `find_max`**:
   - This function is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments by checking the bits of the cumulative XOR values.
   - The function processes the array `cur_arr` and creates a new array `new_arr` containing cumulative XOR values up to the point where the `bit`-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0.
   - It then recursively calls itself with the new array and the next bit (bit - 1).
   - The function handles the case where the `bit`-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 1 by returning the maximum value between the result of the recursive call with the original array and the length of the new array.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of the final cumulative XOR is 0, it returns the result of the recursive call with the new array.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of the recursive call with the original array and the length of the new array.
   - If the `bit`-th bit of `x` is 0, it returns the result of the recursive call with the new array.

The key issue is that `func_1` does not pass `x` to `find_max`, which is essential for the function to correctly determine the segments. Without `x`, `find_max` cannot check if the bitwise OR of the XOR results is less than or equal to `x`.

Therefore, the program as provided is incorrect because it does not use the parameter `x` in the main function `func_1`, which is necessary to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
