The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or process multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer that represents the number of test cases, with each test case involving integers `k`, `x`, and `a` within their specified ranges. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.

Given the constraints and the lack of explicit parameters in the function signature, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` where `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.**
