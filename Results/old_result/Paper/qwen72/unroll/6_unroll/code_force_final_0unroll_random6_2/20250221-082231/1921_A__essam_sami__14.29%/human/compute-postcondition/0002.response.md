Output State: **The loop will print the smaller of the two squared distances between the diagonally opposite corners of the square for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `steps`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, `h`, `n`, and `x` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, but these values are not retained or meaningful outside the loop. The number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.**
