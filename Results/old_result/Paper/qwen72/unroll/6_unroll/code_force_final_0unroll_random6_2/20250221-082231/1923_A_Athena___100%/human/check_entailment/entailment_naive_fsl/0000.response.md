Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where chips are not initially in a single block but can be moved to form a single block with a different number of operations. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
8
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```

The correct output should be 3, as we need to move the chips from positions 2, 4, and 6 to form a single block. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect. The program counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.
