The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be such that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1, which means `x` must be at least 1. Since `x` is already given to be within the range 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, this condition is inherently satisfied. The variable `i` starts at 1, which is the first value in the range.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for `x` or `i`. However, for clarity, we can specify the initial state of `i` and the condition for `x`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1**
