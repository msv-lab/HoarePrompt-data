### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` reads a binary string from the input and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which is used to count consecutive 1s.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - The function iterates over the list `s` and updates `n` and `ans` based on the pattern of 1s and 0s.
   - If a 1 is encountered, `n` is incremented.
   - If a 0 is encountered and `n` is not 0, `ans` is incremented by `n + 1` and `n` is reset to 0.
   - Finally, `ans` is printed.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm aims to calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of the substring.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies sequences of 1s followed by a 0 and calculates the cost for each such sequence.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the string ends with a sequence of 1s. This means if the string ends with 1s, the cost for the final sequence of 1s is not included in `ans`.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input "10", the function correctly outputs 2.
   - For the input "0000", the function correctly outputs 0.
   - For the input "11000", the function correctly outputs 9.
   - For the input "101011", the function correctly outputs 5.
   - For the input "01101001", the function correctly outputs 11.

5. **Edge Case**:
   - Consider the input "111". The function will output 0, which is incorrect because the string is already sorted, and no operations are needed. The correct output should be 0.
   - Consider the input "1110". The function will output 4, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 4 because the sequence of 1s at the end is not accounted for.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the string ends with a sequence of 1s. This means the total cost calculation is incomplete, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
