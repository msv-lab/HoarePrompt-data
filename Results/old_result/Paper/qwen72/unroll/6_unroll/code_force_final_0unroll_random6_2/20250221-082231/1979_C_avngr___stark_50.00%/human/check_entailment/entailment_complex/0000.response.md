Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The amount received back for a winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by its corresponding multiplier `k_i`.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
   - It then calculates the product of all multipliers `m`.
   - It creates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is `m / k[i]`, which represents the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - It calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the list `c` using the `func_1` function.
   - It then divides each element in `c` by the HCF to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values.
   - It checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is strictly less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The program aims to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total bet `sum(x_i)` is less than the return for any winning outcome `k_i * x_i`.
   - The program uses the product of all multipliers `m` to ensure that the bets are proportional to the multipliers. This is a valid approach because it ensures that the bets are scaled appropriately.
   - The HCF is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values while maintaining the proportionality. This is a valid step because it ensures that the bets are integers and as small as possible.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers `k_i` are the same, the program should output `-1` because it's impossible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the sum of the bets is not less than the return for any winning outcome by printing `-1`.

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - The use of the `gcd` function from the `math` module is correct.
   - The program correctly calculates the HCF of the list `c`.
   - The program correctly checks the condition `sum(c) < m / hcf` and prints the appropriate output.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program calculates `m` as the product of all `k_i`, which can lead to very large numbers. However, since the maximum value of `k_i` is 20 and the maximum value of `n` is 50, `m` will not exceed the limits of Python's integer type.
   - The program correctly reduces the bets by the HCF, ensuring that the bets are integers and as small as possible.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should work as intended for the given problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
