Output State: **For each test case, the list `a` will have its elements modified such that each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.**

To break it down:
- The integer `t` remains the same.
- For each test case, the integer `n` remains the same.
- The list `a` in each test case will have each element `a[i]` increased by `i + 1`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.

For example, if the initial state was:
- `t = 2`
- Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`
- Test Case 2: `n = 2`, `a = [4, 5]`

After the loop executes, the output state would be:
- `t = 2`
- Test Case 1: `n = 3`, `a = [2, 4, 6]`
- Test Case 2: `n = 2`, `a = [5, 7]`
