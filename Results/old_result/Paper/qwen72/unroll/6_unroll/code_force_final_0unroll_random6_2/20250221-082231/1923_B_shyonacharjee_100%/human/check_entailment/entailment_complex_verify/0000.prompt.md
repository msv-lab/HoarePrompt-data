You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `cases` remains unchanged, and the loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the player can survive the attack of the monsters. The variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `x`, `monsters`, `bullets_used`, and `can_survive` are reinitialized for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` and processes `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four inputs: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. It determines whether a player can survive an attack from `n` monsters, where each monster has a position `x_i` and health `a_i`. The player can survive if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters (sum of their health) does not exceed the maximum number of bullets the player can shoot, which is `k` times the distance of the farthest monster. The function prints 'YES' if the player can survive and 'NO' otherwise for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case by first sorting the monsters based on their distance from the character. It then iterates through the sorted list, calculating the total number of bullets needed to kill each monster and checking if the character can survive by ensuring that the total bullets needed do not exceed the product of the distance and the number of bullets that can be fired per second (k). If at any point the total bullets needed exceed this product, the program correctly determines that the character cannot survive and outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES". This approach correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases mentioned in the problem description.
