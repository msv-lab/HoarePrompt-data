Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum final score by optimally performing the described moves. However, the implementation has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of integers `n` for each test case. However, it reads the list of integers as a single string and splits it into a list of strings. This is fine, but it should convert these strings to integers before processing.

2. **Pair Selection and Removal**: The program attempts to select pairs of integers and add the minimum of each pair to the score. However, the way it removes elements from the list is incorrect. The lines `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are intended to remove the first and second elements of the list, but they are not doing so correctly. The expression `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, which means it will only remove the first element and then try to remove the third element, which is not what is intended.

3. **Optimal Pairing**: The program does not use an optimal strategy to pair the integers. The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to sort the list of integers and then pair the smallest integers together. This way, you always add the smallest available integer to the score, which ensures the maximum possible score.

4. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is not necessary. The loop should simply iterate `n` times, selecting and removing pairs of integers.

Given these issues, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. The correct approach would be to sort the list of integers and then sum the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements in a sorted list of `2n` integers will always be the minimum values of the pairs).

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input().strip()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split(' ')))
        
        # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest integers
        lst.sort()
        
        # Sum the first n elements (the minimum values of the pairs)
        ans = sum(lst[:n])
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    # Print the results for each test case
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program follows the optimal strategy and correctly processes the input and output as described in the problem statement.
