You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:

    #State: `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that combines `output2` (containing divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`) and `output1` (containing divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reversed order).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the sequence of numbers assigned is: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), the position \( n \) must be congruent to \( x \) or \( 2k - 1 - x \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \).
   - This means \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k - 1 - x \pmod{2k - 2} \).

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - From \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k - 2} \), we get \( n - x = m(2k - 2) \) for some integer \( m \).
   - From \( n \equiv 2k - 1 - x \pmod{2k - 2} \), we get \( n - (2k - 1 - x) = m(2k - 2) \) or \( n + x - 1 = m(2k - 2) \).

4. **Finding Divisors:**
   - We need to find all divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 1 \) that are of the form \( 2k - 2 \).
   - For each divisor \( d \), we solve \( 2k - 2 = d \) to get \( k = \frac{d + 2}{2} \).
   - \( k \) must be a natural number greater than 1, so \( d \) must be even and \( d + 2 \geq 2x \).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) using the function `func_1`.
   - It then checks if each divisor \( d \) can form a valid \( k \) by ensuring \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).
   - Finally, it counts the number of unique valid \( k \) values and prints the result.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) to find divisors and appends both the divisor and its corresponding quotient to the output lists.
   - The divisors are then combined and returned.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
   - It also ensures that \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1 by checking \( d \) is even and \( k \geq x \).

8. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient for the given constraints, as it only iterates up to \( \sqrt{x} \) to find divisors, which is \( O(\sqrt{x}) \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
