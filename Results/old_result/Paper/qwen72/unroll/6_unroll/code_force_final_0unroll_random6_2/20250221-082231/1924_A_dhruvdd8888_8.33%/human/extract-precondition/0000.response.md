Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem requirements:

```python
def func_1(n, k, s):
```

This ensures that the function receives the necessary inputs to perform the required operations.
