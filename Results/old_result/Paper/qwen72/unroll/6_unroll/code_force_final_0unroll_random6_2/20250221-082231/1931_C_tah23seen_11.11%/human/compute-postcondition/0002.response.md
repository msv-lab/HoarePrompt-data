The variables in the loop head are `i` and `j`. The loop condition is `i <= j`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than or equal to `j`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 0
- `j` is `len(arr) - 1`

Since `len(arr)` is at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5, `j` will be at least 0 and at most 2 * 10^5 - 1. Therefore, `i` being 0 and `j` being at least 0 ensures that `i <= j` is true, and the loop can execute the first time.

No adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `j` is len(arr) - 1**
