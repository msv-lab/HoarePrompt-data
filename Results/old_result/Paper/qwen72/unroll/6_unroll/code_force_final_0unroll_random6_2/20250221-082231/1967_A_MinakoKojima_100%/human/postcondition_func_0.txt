The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards (`n`), the number of coins available for buying new cards (`k`), and a list of integers (`a`) representing the initial number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by spending the available coins and prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program is that `ans_list` contains the results for all test cases, and the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are no longer meaningful outside the context of the loop.
