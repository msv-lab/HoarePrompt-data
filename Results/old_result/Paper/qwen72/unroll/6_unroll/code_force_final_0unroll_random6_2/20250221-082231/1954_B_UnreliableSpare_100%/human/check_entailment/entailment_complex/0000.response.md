Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` from the input.

2. **Beautiful Array Check**: The program checks if all elements in `arr` are the same by iterating through the list and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different. This is a valid check for a beautiful array where all elements are the same, as such an array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Minimum Consecutive Sequence Length Calculation**: If the array is not all the same, the program calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr`. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element. The minimum count is updated whenever a different element is encountered.

4. **Output**: 
   - If the array is all the same (i.e., `flag` is `True`), the program prints `-1`, which is correct because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - If the array is not all the same (i.e., `flag` is `False`), the program prints the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element. This is intended to be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program only considers the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the first element in `arr`. This is incorrect because the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, regardless of which element is being considered. The program should consider the minimum length of consecutive sequences of any element in the array, not just the first element.

To fix this, the program should:
- Iterate through all unique elements in the array.
- For each unique element, find the minimum length of consecutive sequences of that element.
- The final answer should be the minimum of these lengths.

Given this flaw, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
