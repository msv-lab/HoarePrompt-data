### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads the integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Permutation Generation:**
   - The program generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the list `a` using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.

3. **Output:**
   - The modified list `a` is printed, which is the permutation.

4. **Validation of the Permutation:**
   - The problem requires that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are in reverse order while the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions. This approach helps to avoid the condition where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any `i` and `j`.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 4`, the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, `a` becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   - For `n = 3`, the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, `a` becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly generates a permutation of length `n` and ensures that the condition `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` is not met by reversing the elements at even indices.
   - This approach is valid for all `n` in the range `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
