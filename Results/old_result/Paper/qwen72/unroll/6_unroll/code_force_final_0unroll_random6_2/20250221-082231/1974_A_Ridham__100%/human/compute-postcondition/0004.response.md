To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `x` and `y` are the last input integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\).
- `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `result`**:
   - `result` is a list that contains integers representing the number of screens required for each iteration.
   - The exact values in `result` are not provided, but we know that each element is an integer.

2. **`map(str, result)`**:
   - The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in the `result` list.
   - This converts each integer in the `result` list to a string.

3. **`'\n'.join(map(str, result))`**:
   - The `join` method concatenates all the string elements in the list returned by `map(str, result)` into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that each number in the `result` list will be printed on a new line.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Since the exact values of the elements in `result` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[len(result) - 1]] (where each element of `result` is an integer representing the number of screens required for each iteration)**
