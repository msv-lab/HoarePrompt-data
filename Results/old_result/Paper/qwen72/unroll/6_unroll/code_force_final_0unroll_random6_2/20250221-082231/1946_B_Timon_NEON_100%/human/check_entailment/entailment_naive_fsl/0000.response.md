Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the overall logic to perform the k operations and calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after these operations is missing. Additionally, the logic in `func_2` for finding the maximum sum subarray is flawed and does not handle all edge cases, such as arrays with all negative numbers or arrays with a mix of positive and negative numbers. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
