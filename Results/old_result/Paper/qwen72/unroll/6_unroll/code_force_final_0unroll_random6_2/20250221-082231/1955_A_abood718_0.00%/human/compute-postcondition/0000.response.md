The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, so we don't need to adjust `i` directly. However, we need to ensure that the input provided is a valid integer that fits within the constraints given for `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The input to the loop should be a valid integer within the range of `t` to ensure the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a valid integer and greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, `int(input())` must be a valid integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `t`**
