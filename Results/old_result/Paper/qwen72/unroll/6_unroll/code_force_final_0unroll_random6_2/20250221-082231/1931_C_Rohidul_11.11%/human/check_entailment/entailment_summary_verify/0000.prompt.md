You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
        (st, end) = (0, 0)
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = r - l - 1
        elif st == 0 and end == 0 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            ans = len(a) - 1
        else:
            ans = r - l
        print(max(0, ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the maximum length of a subarray within `a` that does not contain consecutive equal elements. If the entire array consists of equal elements, it prints 0. The function does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, or `a` and processes all test cases provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple different values, but the most frequent value is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
7
4 3 2 7 1 1 3
```

The expected output is 6, because the optimal solution is to set the values from index 0 to 5 to 1, which costs 6 burles. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect. The program fails to consider the most frequent value in the array and the cost to make all elements equal to that value.
