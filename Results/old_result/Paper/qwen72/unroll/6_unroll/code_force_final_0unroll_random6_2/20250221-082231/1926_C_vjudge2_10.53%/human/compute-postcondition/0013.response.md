The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the largest number Vladislav writes, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.

The function returns different values based on the input:
- Case_1: For each test case, if `n` is 1, the function returns 1.
- Case_2: For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, the function returns the number of times Vladislav needs to write numbers to reach or exceed `n` by writing consecutive integers starting from 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`. `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is the largest number Vladislav writes. For each test case, if `n` is 1, it returns 1. If `n` is greater than 1, it returns the number of times Vladislav needs to write numbers to reach or exceed `n` by writing consecutive integers starting from 1.**
