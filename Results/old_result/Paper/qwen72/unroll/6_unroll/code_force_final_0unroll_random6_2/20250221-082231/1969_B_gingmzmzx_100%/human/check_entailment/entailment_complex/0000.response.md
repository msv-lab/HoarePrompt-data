Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The key idea is to count the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1', as these are the positions where a cyclic shift is needed to move the '0' or '1' to its correct position.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` using `s.count(0)`.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's as it iterates through the string.
   - It also initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string:
     - If `c` is '0', it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any '1's before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is '1', it adds the number of remaining '0's after it (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1: "10"**
  - `zeroes = 1`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` → `cnt = [0, 1]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` → `cnt = [1, 1]` → `ans += 1` (1 '1' before '0')
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Example 2: "0000"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 0` → `cnt = [1, 0]` → `ans += 0` (no '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` → `cnt = [2, 0]` → `ans += 0` (no '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 3: `c = 0` → `cnt = [3, 0]` → `ans += 0` (no '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` → `cnt = [4, 0]` → `ans += 0` (no '1's before '0')
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Example 3: "11000"**
  - `zeroes = 3`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` → `cnt = [0, 1]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 2: `c = 1` → `cnt = [0, 2]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 3: `c = 0` → `cnt = [1, 2]` → `ans += 1` (2 '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` → `cnt = [2, 2]` → `ans += 1` (2 '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 5: `c = 0` → `cnt = [3, 2]` → `ans += 1` (2 '1's before '0')
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Example 4: "101011"**
  - `zeroes = 2`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 1` → `cnt = [0, 1]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 2: `c = 0` → `cnt = [1, 1]` → `ans += 1` (1 '1' before '0')
  - Iteration 3: `c = 1` → `cnt = [1, 2]` → `ans += 1` (1 '0' after '1')
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` → `cnt = [2, 2]` → `ans += 1` (2 '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 5: `c = 1` → `cnt = [2, 3]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 6: `c = 1` → `cnt = [2, 4]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Example 5: "01101001"**
  - `zeroes = 4`
  - `cnt = [0, 0]`
  - `ans = 0`
  - Iteration 1: `c = 0` → `cnt = [1, 0]` → `ans += 0` (no '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 2: `c = 1` → `cnt = [1, 1]` → `ans += 3` (3 '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 3: `c = 1` → `cnt = [1, 2]` → `ans += 3` (3 '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 4: `c = 0` → `cnt = [2, 2]` → `ans += 2` (2 '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 5: `c = 1` → `cnt = [2, 3]` → `ans += 2` (2 '0's after '1')
  - Iteration 6: `c = 0` → `cnt = [3, 3]` → `ans += 3` (3 '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 7: `c = 0` → `cnt = [4, 3]` → `ans += 3` (3 '1's before '0')
  - Iteration 8: `c = 1` → `cnt = [4, 4]` → `ans += 0` (no '0's after '1')
  - Output: `11` (Correct)
