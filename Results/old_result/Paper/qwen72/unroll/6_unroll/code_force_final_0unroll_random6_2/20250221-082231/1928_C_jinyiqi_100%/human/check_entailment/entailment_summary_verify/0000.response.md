### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values `n` and `x`.
   - This is in line with the problem description and is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` and checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - It appends both `i` and `x // i` to the list of divisors.
   - It reverses the first list of divisors and concatenates it with the second list to ensure all divisors are included.
   - This function is correct and efficiently finds all divisors of `x`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks two conditions: `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0`.
   - These conditions are derived from the problem's constraints and the pattern of the settling process.
   - For each condition, it calls `func_1` to find the divisors of the respective value.
   - It then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values:
     - `k` must be even and greater than or equal to `x`.
     - `(s + 2) / 2` is used to convert the divisor `s` to a potential `k` value.
   - It collects all valid `k` values in the `output` list, ensures they are unique by converting the list to a set, and then prints the length of the set.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` must be greater than 1.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`.

5. **Correctness of the Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is based on the pattern of the settling process, which repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are derived from the fact that the position `n` and the number `x` must align with the pattern of the settling process.
   - The filtering step ensures that only valid `k` values are considered, which must be even and greater than or equal to `x`.

6. **Verification of the Conditions**:
   - The condition `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` checks if the sum of `n` and `x - 2` is even.
   - The condition `(n - x) % 2 == 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `x` is even.
   - Both conditions are necessary to ensure that the position `n` and the number `x` align with the pattern of the settling process.

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case `n = 10` and `x = 2`, the program correctly identifies `k = 2, 3, 5, 6` as valid.
   - For the test case `n = 3` and `x = 1`, the program correctly identifies `k = 2` as valid.
   - For the test case `n = 100` and `x = 99`, the program correctly identifies that no valid `k` exists.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, handles all edge cases, and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Final: **True**
