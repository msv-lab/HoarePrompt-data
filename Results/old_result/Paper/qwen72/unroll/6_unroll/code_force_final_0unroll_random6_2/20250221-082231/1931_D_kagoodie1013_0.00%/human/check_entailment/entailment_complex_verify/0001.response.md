Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input and the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - This is done correctly and ensures that all test cases are stored for further processing.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes `count` to 0, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

4. **Loop Through Array**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` is used to find the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y = num % y` is used to find the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - The program then increments `count` by the number of elements in `mod_x_map` that have the same `mod_x` and the number of elements in `mod_y_map` that have the same `mod_y`.

5. **Update Dictionaries**:
   - The program updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key = num % x` is used to find the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y_key = num % y` is used to find the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - The counts of these remainders in the dictionaries are incremented.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of results, one for each test case.
   - The main program prints the results, one per line, as required.

However, there is a logical issue in the way the program calculates the beautiful pairs:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Beautiful Pairs**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that if `mod_x` and `mod_y` are the same for two elements, then the pair is beautiful.
  - The correct condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is:
    - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
    - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - The current implementation does not correctly check these conditions. Specifically, it should check if \((a_i + a_j) % x == 0\) and \((a_i - a_j) % y == 0\).

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the program should use nested loops to compare each pair of elements in the array.
   - For each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\), it should check if both conditions are satisfied and increment the count if they are.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the beautiful pairs. The current implementation incorrectly uses the remainders to count pairs without verifying the actual conditions for a pair to be beautiful.

Final: **False**
