- The program's approach of calculating the product of all multipliers and then dividing by each multiplier to find the bets is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results.
   - A more efficient and correct approach would be to find a set of bets such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. This can be achieved by setting the bets in a way that the sum of the bets is just less than the minimum of the `c[i] * k[i]` values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_bets(k):
    total = reduce(lcm, k)
    bets = [total // ki for ki in k]
    if sum(bets) < total:
        return bets
    else:
        return -1

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = find_bets(k)
    if result == -1:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```
