Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly count the number of beautiful pairs as described in the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to count pairs. The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to track the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. However, it incorrectly adds the counts from both dictionaries to the `count` variable, which can lead to counting pairs that do not satisfy both conditions simultaneously.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
The beautiful pairs should be:
- \langle 1, 4 \rangle: \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (6 is divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (-4 is divisible by 2).

However, the program will count pairs that satisfy either condition separately, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should only count pairs that satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This can be achieved by using a single dictionary to track pairs that satisfy both conditions.
