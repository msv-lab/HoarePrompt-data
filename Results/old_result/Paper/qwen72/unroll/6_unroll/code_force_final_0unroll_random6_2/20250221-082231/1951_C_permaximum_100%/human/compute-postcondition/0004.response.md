Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9)), `prices` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), `pq` is now a heap containing the same elements as the original list of tuples, where each tuple contains a price from `prices` and its corresponding index, `total_cost` is 0, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the introduction of the variable `price_increase`, which is set to 0. All other variables retain their original values and properties.
