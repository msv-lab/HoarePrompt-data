Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to find the optimal indices `r` and `l` such that the sum of the elements outside the sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized.
   - The function iterates over all possible sublists and calculates the potential new sum if the MEX of the sublist is applied to the entire sublist.
   - The function correctly identifies the indices `r` and `l` that maximize this sum.
   - However, the function does not actually compute the MEX of the sublist, which is a critical part of the problem. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sublist, and the function should return this value along with the indices.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to append operations to the `ops` list.
   - The function is recursive and appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum.
   - The function does not compute the MEX or update the array `lst` in any way, which means it does not contribute to the solution of the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is supposed to apply the operation to the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` and update the `ops` list.
   - The function appends several operations to `ops` and updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to contain the value `n` (which is the length of the sublist).
   - The function does not correctly compute the MEX of the sublist. Instead, it sets the entire sublist to the length of the sublist, which is not the correct approach.
   - The function also appends redundant operations to `ops`, which is not optimal.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the input, initializes the list `lst`, and the operations list `ops`.
   - It repeatedly calls `func_1` to find the optimal indices and then `func_3` to apply the operation.
   - After the loop, it tries to replace any remaining zeros in the list with ones, which is a valid step but not the most efficient way to maximize the sum.
   - The program prints the final sum and the operations list.

**Conclusion**:
The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the sublists and does not apply the operations in a way that maximizes the sum of the array. The functions `func_1` and `func_3` are flawed in their logic, and `func_2` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
