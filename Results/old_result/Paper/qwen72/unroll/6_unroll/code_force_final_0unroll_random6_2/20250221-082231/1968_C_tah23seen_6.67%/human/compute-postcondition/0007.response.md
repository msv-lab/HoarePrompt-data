Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, the middle elements (from index 1 to n-2) are cumulative sums of `arr` values from index 0 to the current index, adjusted to be greater than the corresponding `arr` elements, and the last element is the sum of the second-to-last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`. **
