### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them. Each test case is processed by calling `func_2()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The function starts by setting `row[0]` to 1, which is correct because the cost of installing a support in the first column (river bank) is always 1.
     - It then iterates over the first `d` cells (excluding the first cell) and increases their values by 2. This is correct because the cost of installing a support in these cells is `a_{i,j} + 1`, and since `row[0]` is 1, the total cost for the first `d` cells is `a_{i,j} + 2`.
   - **Heap Initialization:**
     - A min-heap is created from the first `d` elements of the row. This is used to find the minimum cost of installing supports in the subsequent cells.
   - **Dynamic Programming with Heap:**
     - The function iterates over the remaining cells in the row, starting from index `d`.
     - For each cell, it pops elements from the heap until the distance between the current cell and the cell at the top of the heap is less than or equal to `d + 2`. This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
     - The cost of installing a support in the current cell is updated by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the current cell's depth plus 1.
     - The updated cell is then pushed back into the heap.
   - **Return Value:**
     - The function returns the last element of the row, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads the input for each test case, including the dimensions of the grid, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance between supports.
     - It then reads the grid of depths and stores it in `rows`.
   - **Calculating Costs:**
     - The function calls `func_1` for each row in `rows` to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.
   - **Finding Minimum Total Cost:**
     - The function then calculates the total cost for each possible segment of `k` consecutive rows.
     - It prints the minimum total cost among these segments.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly implements the logic for finding the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and then finding the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.
- The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the dynamic programming approach is efficient and correctly handles the constraints.
- The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
