### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a list of slimes with sizes `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - Each slime can eat its neighbor if it is strictly larger.
   - We need to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report -1 if it is impossible.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point of `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is found in `a`, it returns the index of `x` plus 1.
   - If `x` is not found, it returns the index where `x` would be inserted, but `a[inx]` is not equal to `x`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from the left side.
   - It maintains two lists: `left` for the cumulative sum of slime sizes and `last` for the last occurrence of a different element before the current index.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and updates the `ans` list based on the following conditions:
     - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, the slime at index `i` can be eaten by the slime at index `i-1` in 1 second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum up to `i` and subtracts the current slime size to get `x`.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index of the first element in `left` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It then updates `ans[i]` based on the minimum of the current value and the difference between `i + 1` and the index found by `func_1`.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and their sizes `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` on the original list `a` and on the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results from both calls to get the minimum time for each slime to be eaten from either direction.
   - If a slime can be eaten from one direction but not the other, it takes the maximum of the two values (which will be -1 if it cannot be eaten from one direction).
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Cumulative Sum and Last Occurrence**:
  - The cumulative sum `left` helps in quickly calculating the total size of slimes before the current index.
  - The `last` list helps in tracking the last occurrence of a different element, which is useful for determining the minimum time to be eaten.

- **Reversing the List**:
  - By processing the list from both directions (left and right), the program ensures that it considers all possible ways the slimes can be eaten.
  - This is crucial because a slime might be eaten faster from the right side than from the left side.

- **Combining Results**:
  - The program combines the results from both directions to get the minimum time for each slime to be eaten.
  - If a slime cannot be eaten from one direction, it takes the maximum value (which will be -1 if it cannot be eaten at all).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum time for each slime to be eaten based on the problem description. The use of cumulative sums and tracking the last occurrence of different elements ensures that the program can efficiently handle the slimes' eating process from both directions.

### Correctness:
**True**
