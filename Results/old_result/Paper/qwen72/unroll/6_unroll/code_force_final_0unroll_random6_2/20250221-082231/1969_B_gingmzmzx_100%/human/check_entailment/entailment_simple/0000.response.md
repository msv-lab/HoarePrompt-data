### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It then counts the number of zeroes in the string.
   - The program uses a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string, updating `cnt` and calculating the cost `ans` based on the current character and the counts in `cnt`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each '0' in the string, if there are any '1's before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to the cost `ans`.
   - For each '1' in the string, it adds the number of '0's that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to the cost `ans`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the input constraints and multiple test cases.
   - The cost calculation logic is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after a '1' in the original string needs to be moved to the front, and each '1' that appears before a '0' needs to be moved to the end.
   - The program correctly computes the minimum total cost by summing the necessary shifts for each character.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles strings that are already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111").
   - It also handles cases where the string is not sorted but can be sorted with the minimum number of shifts.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input "10", the program correctly outputs 2 because the entire string needs to be cyclically shifted once.
   - For the input "0000", the program correctly outputs 0 because the string is already sorted.
   - For the input "11000", the program correctly outputs 9, which is the sum of the costs of the optimal shifts as described in the problem statement.
   - For the input "101011", the program correctly outputs 5, which is the sum of the costs of the optimal shifts.
   - For the input "01101001", the program correctly outputs 11, which is the sum of the costs of the optimal shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The cost calculation is consistent with the problem statement, and the program handles all edge cases and examples correctly.

**Correctness: True**
