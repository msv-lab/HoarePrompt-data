The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be used to iterate over the range. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that the input is a positive integer, which aligns with the given state that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
