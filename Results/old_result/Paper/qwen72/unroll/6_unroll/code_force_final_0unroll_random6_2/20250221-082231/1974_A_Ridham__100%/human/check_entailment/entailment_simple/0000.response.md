### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to read the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total space required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. This is done by:
     - `space_x = x * 1` for 1x1 icons.
     - `space_y = y * 4` for 2x2 icons.
     - `total_space = space_y + space_x` for the total space required.

3. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons. This is done by:
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.
   - This is correct because a 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells. Therefore, each screen can hold at most 3.75 (or 3 when considering whole icons) 2x2 icons. The calculation ensures that all 2x2 icons are placed on the minimum number of screens.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`.
   - This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

5. **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the program appends `screen_require_for_y` to the result.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`.
     - If `extra_space` is a multiple of 15, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15`.
     - Otherwise, `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`.
   - The program then appends the total number of screens (`extra_screen + screen_require_for_y`) to the result.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, each on a new line, which matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens. The logic for calculating the number of screens required is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: True**
