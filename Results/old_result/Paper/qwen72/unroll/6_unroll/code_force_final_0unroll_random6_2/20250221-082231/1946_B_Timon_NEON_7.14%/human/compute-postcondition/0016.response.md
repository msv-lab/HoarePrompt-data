The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element is between -10^9 and 10^9. The function returns a list `total_max_segment`. If `total_max_segment` has only one element, it is `[-1]`. Otherwise, `total_max_segment` is the list from `segments_variants` with the highest sum, including the sum of the positive segment, the indices of the first and last elements in that segment, and the additional value `len(arr) - 1`.
