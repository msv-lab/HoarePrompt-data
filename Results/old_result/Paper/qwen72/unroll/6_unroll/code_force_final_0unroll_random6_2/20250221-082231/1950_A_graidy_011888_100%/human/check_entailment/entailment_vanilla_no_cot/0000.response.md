Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case by reading three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
   - If `a < b` and `b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the conditions given.

The program follows the problem's constraints and requirements, and it will produce the correct output for valid inputs as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
