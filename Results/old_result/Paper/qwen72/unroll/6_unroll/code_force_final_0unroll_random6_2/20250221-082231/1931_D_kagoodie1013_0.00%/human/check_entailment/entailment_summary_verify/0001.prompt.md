You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding test case's array `arr` such that `i < j`, `-arr[i] % x` and `arr[j] % y` both result in values that have been previously seen in the array. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input and the array `arr` of length `n`.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the problem's input format.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The program appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - This is done correctly and ensures that all test cases are stored for further processing.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It initializes `count` to 0, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes two dictionaries `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.

4. **Loop Through Array**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates `mod_x` and `mod_y`:
     - `mod_x = -num % x` is used to find the remainder when `-num` is divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y = num % y` is used to find the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - The program then increments `count` by the number of elements in `mod_x_map` that have the same `mod_x` and the number of elements in `mod_y_map` that have the same `mod_y`.

5. **Update Dictionaries**:
   - The program updates `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` with the current element's remainders:
     - `mod_x_key = num % x` is used to find the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
     - `mod_y_key = num % y` is used to find the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
   - The counts of these remainders in the dictionaries are incremented.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of results, one for each test case.
   - The main program prints the results, one per line, as required.

However, there is a logical issue in the way the program calculates the beautiful pairs:

- **Incorrect Calculation of Beautiful Pairs**:
  - The program incorrectly assumes that if `mod_x` and `mod_y` are the same for two elements, then the pair is beautiful.
  - The correct condition for a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful is:
    - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
    - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - The current implementation does not correctly check these conditions. Specifically, it should check if \((a_i + a_j) % x == 0\) and \((a_i - a_j) % y == 0\).

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly count the beautiful pairs, the program should use nested loops to compare each pair of elements in the array.
   - For each pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\), it should check if both conditions are satisfied and increment the count if they are.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the beautiful pairs.

Correctness: **False**
