Precondition: **n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases, the size of the chessboard, the number of moves already played, and the moves themselves. Here is the corrected function definition:

```
def func_1(t, n, k, moves):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and moves is a list of k tuples (r_i, c_i) where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, representing the positions of the rooks already placed. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**
