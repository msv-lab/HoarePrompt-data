Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the problem statement. Here is a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem's input format.

2. **Case 1: `n == k`**:
   - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This is handled correctly by printing "YES", followed by 1 stall with a price of 1.

3. **Case 2: `n + 2 > k * 2`**:
   - This condition simplifies to `n > 2k - 2`. If this condition is true, it means Alice can buy `k-1` jewels from a stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and then buy 1 more jewel from a stall priced at 1 coin per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and is handled correctly by printing "YES", followed by 2 stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and 1.

4. **Case 3: `n + 2 <= k * 2`**:
   - If the above conditions are not met, it means Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. This is handled correctly by printing "NO".

The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement and ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the allowed limit. The prices are also within the allowed range of 1 to \(10^{18}\).

Therefore, the program is correct.
