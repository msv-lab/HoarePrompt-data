Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from standard input. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a distinct string of length 5 with letters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters in the last test case, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value. **
