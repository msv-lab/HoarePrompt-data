Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where the coordinates of the square are given in a different order:

Input:
```
1
1 1
1 4
4 1
4 4
```

The correct output should be `9` because the side length of the square is `3` (from `1` to `4` on both the x-axis and y-axis), and the area is `3 * 3 = 9`. However, the program calculates the distance between two points and uses the smaller of the two distances to determine the area, which can lead to incorrect results if the points are not in a specific order. In this case, the program will print `1` instead of `9`, which is incorrect.
