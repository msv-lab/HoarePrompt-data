Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the elements in the arrays `lft` and `rgt` are not in the same order after sorting, which can lead to incorrect pairing of elements. Specifically, the program assumes that the elements in `lft` and `rgt` will be in pairs after sorting, but this is not guaranteed. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4 1
1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1
```

After sorting, `lft` and `rgt` will both be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. However, the program will not correctly pair the elements to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal. The program will output:

```
1 1
1 1
```

This output is incorrect because `1 ⊕ 1 = 0` and `1 ⊕ 1 = 0`, but the problem requires that the elements in `l` and `r` be subsets of the first half and second half of the input array, respectively, and the elements in `l` and `r` should be different to satisfy the XOR condition. A correct output for this case could be:

```
1 2
3 4
```

or any other valid combination that satisfies the XOR condition.
