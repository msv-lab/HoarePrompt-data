Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` edges, each defined by three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It calculates a value `s` based on these inputs and prints `s % M`, where `M` is \(10^9 + 7\). The value of `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`, with `c` being the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. **
