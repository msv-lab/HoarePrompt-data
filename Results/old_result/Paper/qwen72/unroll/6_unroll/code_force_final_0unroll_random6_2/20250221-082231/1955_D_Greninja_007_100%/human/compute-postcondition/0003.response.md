Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first m elements of list `a`, `ans` is 0, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between the first m elements of `a` and `b`.**
