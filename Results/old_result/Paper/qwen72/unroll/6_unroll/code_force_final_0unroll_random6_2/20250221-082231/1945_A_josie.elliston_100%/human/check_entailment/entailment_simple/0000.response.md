### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it further checks if the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 plus the number of `universals` is less than 3. If this condition is true, it returns `None`, indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts according to their preferences.
   - If the condition is not met, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate all extroverts and universals.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` calculates the total number of tents needed by adding the number of tents required for introverts (which is simply `introverts` since each introvert needs a separate tent) to the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there are not enough universals to make up the remainder, the function returns `None`, which is correctly handled by `func_2` to return -1.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement and the provided examples. It ensures that introverts are given separate tents, extroverts are accommodated in groups of three, and universals are used to fill the remaining spots as needed. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions, it correctly returns -1.

**Correctness: True**
