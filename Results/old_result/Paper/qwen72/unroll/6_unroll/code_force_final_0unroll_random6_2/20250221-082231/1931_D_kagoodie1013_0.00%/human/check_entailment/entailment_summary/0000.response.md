Reasoning:
The program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array `a` for multiple test cases. A beautiful pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is defined by two conditions:
1. \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
2. \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

The function `func_1` processes each test case as follows:
- It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
- It uses two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
- For each element `num` in the array, it calculates:
  - `mod_x = -num % x` (this is intended to help find pairs where \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\)).
  - `mod_y = num % y` (this is intended to help find pairs where \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\)).
- It then increments the counter `count` by the number of times the current `mod_x` and `mod_y` have been seen before in the array.
- It updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) means that \((a_i + a_j) % x == 0\), which is equivalent to \((a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0\).
- The condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) means that \((a_i - a_j) % y == 0\), which is equivalent to \((a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0\).

The program incorrectly uses `mod_x = -num % x` and `mod_y = num % y` to check for these conditions. Specifically:
- `mod_x = -num % x` does not correctly represent the condition \((a_i + a_j) % x == 0\). Instead, it should use `mod_x = num % x` and check if there exists another element `a_j` such that \((a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0\).
- `mod_y = num % y` is correct for checking the condition \((a_i - a_j) % y == 0\).

To fix this, the program should:
- Use `mod_x = num % x` and check if there exists another element `a_j` such that \((a_i % x + a_j % x) % x == 0\).
- Use `mod_y = num % y` and check if there exists another element `a_j` such that \((a_i % y - a_j % y) % y == 0\).

Given the current implementation, the program will not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
