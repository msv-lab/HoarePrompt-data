Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, representing whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. The input must be provided in a structured format, typically through standard input or a predefined input method, as the function itself does not take any parameters. Additionally, in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip. `t` is the number of test cases to be processed, and `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    res = 0
    while a and a[0] == 0:
        a.pop(0)
    while a and a[-1] == 0:
        a.pop()
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == 0:
            res += 1
    print(res)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
