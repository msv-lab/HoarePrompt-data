Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of integers and we can perform an operation that sets a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to perform the MEX operation on.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is set to its MEX.
   - The MEX of a subarray is approximated by \((j - i + 1) ** 2\), which is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX value.
   - It does this by repeatedly calling itself with a smaller subarray and appending the operation to `ops`.
   - The function does not actually compute the MEX value, which is a critical part of the problem.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and updates the list `ops` with the operations.
   - It appends the operation to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends the operation again.
   - It then appends another operation and recursively calls `func_2` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - Finally, it updates the subarray in `lst` to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not \((j - i + 1) ** 2\).
   - **Operation Sequence**: The sequence of operations in `func_2` and `func_3` is not optimal and does not correctly handle the MEX value.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array elements because it uses an incorrect MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are performed optimally.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
