Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case. This is in line with the problem's input requirements.

2. **Initialization of `values` and `sum_values`**:
   - The `values` list is initialized to store the sum of the digits of each number from 0 to the maximum `n` in the test cases.
   - The `sum_values` list is initialized to store the cumulative sum of the `values` list up to each index.
   - The first 10 elements of `values` are correctly set to the digits themselves (0 through 9), and the `sum_values` list is correctly set to the cumulative sum of these digits.

3. **Calculation of `values` and `sum_values`**:
   - For numbers greater than 9, the program correctly splits the number into its last digit and the remaining part.
   - The sum of the digits of the number is calculated by adding the sum of the digits of the last digit and the sum of the digits of the remaining part.
   - The cumulative sum is updated in `sum_values` by adding the current value of `values[i]` to the previous cumulative sum.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each `n` in the `numbers` list, which corresponds to the sum of the numbers on the board after the replacement.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a pre-computation approach to calculate the sum of digits and their cumulative sums up to the maximum `n` in the test cases. This is efficient and avoids recalculating the same values multiple times.
   - The time complexity of the pre-computation loop is O(n), and the space complexity is also O(n), which is manageable given the constraints.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is a single-digit number correctly by using the pre-computed values in `values` and `sum_values`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
