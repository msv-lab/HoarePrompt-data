The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a result based on these parameters. However, the specific output based on the parameters is not provided in the example, so I will describe the general functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints and relationships.**
