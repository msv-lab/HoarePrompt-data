Reasoning:

The program is designed to generate an array `a` based on the given array `x` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The approach taken in the function `func_1` is to initialize the first element of `a` as `arr[0] + 1` (which is `x_2 + 1`), and then for each subsequent element, it calculates the cumulative sum of the elements in `arr` from the start up to the current index, adjusting it if necessary to ensure that `a_i` is greater than `x_i` and satisfies the modulo condition.

1. **Initialization of `ans[0]`**: The first element `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `ans[1] mod ans[0]` will equal `arr[0]` because `arr[0]` is the remainder when `ans[1]` is divided by `ans[0]`.

2. **Loop for middle elements**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n-2` (i.e., from `x_2` to `x_{n-1}`). For each `i`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This ensures that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i]` and that `ans[i + 1] mod ans[i]` will equal `arr[i]`. If `ans[i + 1]` is not greater than `arr[i + 1]`, it adjusts `ans[i + 1]` by repeatedly adding `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than `arr[i + 1]`. This adjustment ensures that the modulo condition is met for the next element as well.

3. **Setting the last element**: The last element `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`. This ensures that `ans[n-1] mod ans[n-2]` will equal `arr[n-1]`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the generated array `ans` for each test case.

The program's logic is sound and meets the requirements of the problem. The adjustments made in the loop ensure that the modulo conditions are satisfied for all elements. The constraints on the input values are also respected, as the values of `ans` are kept within the range `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

Correctness: **True**
