Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a subarray to its MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - We need to ensure that the operations are performed within the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to perform the MEX operation on.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is set to its MEX.
   - However, the MEX calculation is incorrect. Instead of calculating the MEX, it uses \((j - i + 1) ** 2\), which is the square of the length of the subarray. This is not the correct way to compute the MEX.
   - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum based on this incorrect MEX calculation.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to set the subarray from `r` to `l` to the MEX value.
   - It does this by repeatedly calling itself with a smaller subarray and appending the operation to `ops`.
   - The function does not actually compute the MEX value, which is a critical part of the problem. This means that the operations it generates are not based on the correct MEX value.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function performs the operation on the subarray from `r` to `l` and updates the list `ops` with the operations.
   - It appends the operation to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends the operation again.
   - It then appends another operation and recursively calls `func_2` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
   - Finally, it updates the subarray in `lst` to the MEX value, which is the length of the subarray.
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_3`, but the MEX value used is incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the length of the subarray.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: Both `func_1` and `func_3` use incorrect methods to calculate the MEX value. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the length of the subarray or the square of the length.
   - **Operation Sequence**: The sequence of operations generated by `func_2` and `func_3` is not based on the correct MEX value, making the operations invalid.
   - **Sum Maximization**: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array elements because it uses an incorrect MEX value and does not ensure that the operations are performed optimally.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
