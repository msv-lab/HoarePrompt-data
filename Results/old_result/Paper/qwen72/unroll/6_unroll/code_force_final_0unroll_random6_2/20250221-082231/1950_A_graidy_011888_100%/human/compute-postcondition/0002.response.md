Output State: **The loop will print 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` provided during that iteration. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated with the new input values for each iteration, and `i` will increment from 0 to `n-1`. After the loop completes, the final value of `i` will be `n-1`.**
