### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows x 3 columns).
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` because each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows (since 2x2 icons can be placed in a 2x2 block, and each screen has 5 rows, so 2 rows per 2x2 icon).
   - The program then checks if `t` is divisible by 5. If it is, `t` is set to `t // 5`. If not, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`. This ensures that the number of screens is rounded up to the nearest whole number.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The calculation `t = b * 2` and the subsequent rounding up to the nearest whole number of screens is correct. Each 2x2 icon requires 2 rows, and since each screen has 5 rows, the number of screens required is `ceil(b * 2 / 5)`. The program correctly calculates this as `t = t // 5 + 1` if `t % 5 != 0`.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons on the screens already allocated: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - It then checks if the remaining space on these screens is enough to place all 1x1 icons (`a`). If it is, the number of screens remains `t`.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct. It correctly computes the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons. If `t1 >= a`, the number of screens remains `t`.

4. **Additional Screens for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space is not enough for all 1x1 icons, the program calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The variable `t2` is set to `a - t1`, which represents the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the already allocated screens.
   - The program then checks if `t2` is divisible by 15. If it is, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`. If not, `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the additional screen needed.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The calculation `t2 = a - t1` and the subsequent increment of `t` is correct. If `t2 % 15 != 0`, the program correctly adds an additional screen to account for the remaining 1x1 icons.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The output is correctly printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of 2x2 Icon Placement**:
  - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. The logic for rounding up to the nearest whole number of screens is accurate.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icon Placement**:
  - The program correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens allocated for 2x2 icons and checks if it is sufficient for the 1x1 icons.
  - If additional screens are needed, the program correctly calculates and adds the necessary screens.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
