The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `arr` of `n` integers. It then prints the first integer `i` that is either not present in `arr` or is present exactly once after the first occurrence of a number that appears exactly once in `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function, but the internal state of the loop, including the `mpp` dictionary and the `first` flag, is reset for each test case.
