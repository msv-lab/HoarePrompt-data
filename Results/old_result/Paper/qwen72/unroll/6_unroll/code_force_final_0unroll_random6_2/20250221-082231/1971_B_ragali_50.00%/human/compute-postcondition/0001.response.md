The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `s` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters**
