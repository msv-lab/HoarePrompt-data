### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description, where the first line of input contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `n` times. This is correct as it matches the requirement to process `n` test cases.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is also correct as it matches the problem description, which states that each test case contains three digits.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if true. This correctly identifies a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if true. This correctly identifies a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, the program prints 'NONE'. This correctly handles the case where the digits do not form a stair or a peak.

5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate output for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Final State**: The program processes all `n` test cases and prints the correct output for each, as described in the comments.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
