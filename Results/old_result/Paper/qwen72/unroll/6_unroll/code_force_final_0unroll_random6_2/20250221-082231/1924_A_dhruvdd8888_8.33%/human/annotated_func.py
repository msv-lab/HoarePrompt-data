#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func_1():
    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of such substrings found in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is a list containing the last character of each substring of `s` that contains all `k` unique characters, `ps` is the number of such substrings found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: The loop prints a string for each unique character in `us` that is not in `win`. Each string is formed by concatenating the characters in `ans`, followed by the unique character from `us`, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. The variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It takes three inputs: `n`, `k`, and `m`, where `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `m` is the length of a string `s` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) that consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function then processes the string `s` to find substrings that contain all `k` unique characters. If the number of such substrings found is at least `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last found substring, it prints a string formed by concatenating the characters in the list of last found substrings, followed by the unique character, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` as described in the annotations.
