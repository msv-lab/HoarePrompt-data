You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and n is even), and a list of two strings, each of length n, containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(str, input()))
        
        b = list(map(str, input()))
        
        if b[n - 2] == str('<'):
            print('No')
        else:
            print('Yes')
        
    #State: The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer n, and two lists of strings a and b, each of length n. After processing, it prints 'No' if the second-to-last character in b is '<', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The variables t, a, and b are not retained between iterations, and their values are reset with each new iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, and two lists of strings `a` and `b`, each of length `n`. The function then checks if the second-to-last character in the list `b` is '<'. If it is, the function prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not retain any state between test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves in two steps: a voluntary move followed by a forced move along the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left (<) or right (>).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (the number of columns).
   - It then reads the arrows in the first row `a` and the second row `b`.
   - The program checks if the arrow in the cell (2, n-1) (i.e., `b[n-2]`) is pointing left (`<`).
   - If `b[n-2]` is `<`, it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The robot needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can only move to the right or down from the first row.
   - To reach the last column in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the second row and then move to the right until it reaches column `n`.
   - The critical point is the cell (2, n-1). If the arrow in this cell points left (`<`), the robot will be forced back to the left and cannot reach the cell (2, n).
   - If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) points right (`>`), the robot can move to the right and reach cell (2, n).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes that `n` is even, as specified in the problem constraints.
   - The program also assumes that the input is valid and does not contain arrows pointing outside the grid, which is consistent with the problem constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly identifies whether the robot can reach cell (2, n) by checking the arrow in cell (2, n-1).
   - If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is `<`, the robot cannot reach the target cell, and the program prints 'No'.
   - If the arrow in cell (2, n-1) is `>`, the robot can reach the target cell, and the program prints 'Yes'.

Correctness: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and constraints.
