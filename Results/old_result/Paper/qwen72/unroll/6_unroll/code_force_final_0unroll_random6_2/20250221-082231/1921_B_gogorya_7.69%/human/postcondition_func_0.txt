The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `t` and `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1' characters. It calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1' characters in `s1` and `s2`, and then adjusts this difference based on the positions of '1' in `s1` and '0' in `s2`. The function prints the adjusted difference for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the only persistent state after the function concludes is the sequence of printed values for each test case.
