Output State: **x and y remain distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and x ≠ y.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input.
- Inside the loop, the variables `n` and `m` are read from user input and used to compute `k`.
- The value of `k` is then printed based on certain conditions, but the values of `x` and `y` are not modified within the loop.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.
