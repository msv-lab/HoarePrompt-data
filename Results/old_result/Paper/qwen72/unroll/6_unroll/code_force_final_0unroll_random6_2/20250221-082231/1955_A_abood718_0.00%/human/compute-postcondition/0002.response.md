The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts `t`, which is an integer indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are integers. The constraints are as follows: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a, b <= 30`.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts and the constraints on them.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a, b <= 30`. The function's return value is not specified based on the given information.**
