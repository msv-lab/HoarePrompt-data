Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it processes numbers greater than 9. Specifically, the line `remainder = int(word[:-1])` is incorrect because it treats the remainder as a single digit, which is not always the case. For example, when `i = 100`, `word[:-1]` will be `"10"`, and `remainder` will be `10`, but the sum of the digits of `100` should be `1 + 0 + 0 = 1`, not `10`. This incorrect handling of the remainder will lead to incorrect sums for numbers with more than two digits.

To fix this, the program should correctly compute the sum of the digits of the remainder, not just treat it as a single digit.
