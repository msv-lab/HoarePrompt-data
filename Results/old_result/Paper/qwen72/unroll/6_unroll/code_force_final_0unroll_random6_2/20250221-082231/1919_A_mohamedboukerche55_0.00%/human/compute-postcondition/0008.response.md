Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After processing all test cases, it prints 'bob' if the sum of the last `a` and `b` values is even, and 'alice' if the sum is odd. The function does not return any value. **
