### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Winning Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `a == b`**:
     - If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the first to make a move, and if both wallets have the same number of coins, Alice will be forced to reduce her wallet to a state where Bob can mirror her moves and eventually win.
   - **Case 2: `a == 1`**:
     - If Alice has only 1 coin, she will lose because she can only remove the coin and then Bob will have a non-empty wallet, allowing Bob to win.
   - **Case 3: `b == 1`**:
     - If Bob has only 1 coin, Alice can always win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, leaving Bob with an empty wallet.
   - **Case 4: `a % 2 == 1`**:
     - If Alice has an odd number of coins, Bob will always win. This is because Alice will always be the first to make a move, and after each move, the number of coins in her wallet will be even. Bob can then mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice will eventually be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - **Case 5: `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`**:
     - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, leaving Bob with an even number of coins and Alice with an odd number of coins. Alice can then mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that Bob will eventually be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - **Case 6: `a > b`**:
     - If Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob will always win. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, and since Alice has more coins, she will eventually be forced to remove the last coin and lose.
   - **Case 7: `a < b`**:
     - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, Alice can always win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, leaving Bob with fewer coins and Alice with more coins. Alice can then mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that Bob will eventually be forced to remove the last coin and lose.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `a == b`, `a == 1`, and `b == 1`.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a % 2 == 1` (Alice has an odd number of coins).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1` (Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a > b` (Alice has more coins than Bob).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `a < b` (Alice has fewer coins than Bob).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where both wallets have the same number of coins.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where one of the wallets has only 1 coin.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the number of coins is very large (up to \(10^9\)).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
