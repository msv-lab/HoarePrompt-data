Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the encoded number is 78 correctly. According to the problem description, the maximum possible sum of the positions of three letters is 78 (i.e., "zzz" = 26 + 26 + 26 = 78). However, the program does not account for this specific case and will incorrectly output "rzz" for an input of 78, which is not the lexicographically smallest word that can be encoded to 78. The correct output for 78 should be "zzz".
