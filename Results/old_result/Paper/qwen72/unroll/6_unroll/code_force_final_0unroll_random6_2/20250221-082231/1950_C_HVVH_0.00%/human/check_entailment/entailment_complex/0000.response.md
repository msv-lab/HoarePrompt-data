Reasoning:  
The program has a logical error in the condition handling for the `day` variable. Specifically, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for hours from 1 to 11, and then checks if `h` is 12 to set `day` to 'AM'. This results in incorrect AM/PM assignments for hours from 1 to 11.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect AM/PM Assignment for Hours 1 to 11**: The program sets `day` to 'PM' for hours from 1 to 11, which is incorrect. These hours should be 'AM'.
2. **Redundant Check for `h == 12`**: The check `if h == 12` is placed after setting `day` to 'PM', which is redundant and incorrect. It should be placed before setting `day` to 'PM'.

To correct the program, the logic for setting `day` should be:
- If `h` is 0, set `h` to 12 and `day` to 'AM'.
- If `h` is 12, set `day` to 'PM'.
- If `h` is greater than 12, set `h` to `h - 12` and `day` to 'PM'.
- Otherwise, set `day` to 'AM'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        h, m = map(int, input().split(':'))
        
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h == 12:
            day = 'PM'
        elif h > 12:
            h = h - 12
            day = 'PM'
        else:
            day = 'AM'
        
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
