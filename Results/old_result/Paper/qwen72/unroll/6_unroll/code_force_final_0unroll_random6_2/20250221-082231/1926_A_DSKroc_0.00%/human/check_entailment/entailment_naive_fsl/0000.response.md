Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the output for each test case correctly. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks are outside the loop that processes each test case, which means the program will only print the result for the last test case. For the given example, the program will only print one result instead of printing a result for each of the 8 test cases. This violates the problem description, which requires an output for each test case.
