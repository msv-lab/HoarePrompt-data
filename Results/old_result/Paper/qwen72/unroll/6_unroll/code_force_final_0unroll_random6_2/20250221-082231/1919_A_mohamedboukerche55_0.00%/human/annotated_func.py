#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost.
    if ((a + b) % 2 == 0) :
        print('bob  ')
        #This is printed: bob
    else :
        print('alice')
        #This is printed: alice
    #State: *The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop, and `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases). The initial values of `a` and `b` provided before the loop will be lost. Additionally, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the sum of `a` and `b` is divisible by 2. Otherwise, the sum of `a` and `b` is not divisible by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After processing all test cases, it prints 'bob' if the sum of the last `a` and `b` values is even, and 'alice' if the sum is odd. The function does not return any value.
