To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to understand the behavior of the function `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, I'll assume a common function that could be used in such a context, such as the greatest common divisor (GCD) function. This is a reasonable assumption because the GCD function is often used in loops where a common divisor is being computed iteratively.

Given this assumption, `func_1(den, x)` will compute the GCD of `den` and `x` and update `den` with the result. Let's break down the loop:

1. **Initial State**: `N` is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, `vals` is a list of integers of length N where each element \( k_i \) satisfies 2 <= \( k_i \) <= 20, and `vals` is populated with these integers. `den` is initialized to the first element of `vals`.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `x` in `vals` and updates `den` to be the GCD of `den` and `x`.

3. **Final State**: After the loop finishes, `den` will be the GCD of all the elements in `vals`.

Here is the output state in natural language:

Output State: **`den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `vals`. The list `vals` remains unchanged.**
