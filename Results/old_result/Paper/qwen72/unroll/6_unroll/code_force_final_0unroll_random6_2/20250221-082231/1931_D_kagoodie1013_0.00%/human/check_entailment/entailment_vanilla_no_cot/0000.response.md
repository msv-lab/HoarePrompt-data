Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in how it counts the beautiful pairs. Specifically, the way it updates the `count` variable and the `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map` dictionaries does not correctly account for the conditions required for a pair to be beautiful.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Pair Counting**: The program incorrectly counts pairs by adding the number of elements that have the same remainder when divided by `x` and `y`. This does not ensure that the pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) satisfies both conditions \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by `x` and \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by `y`.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The calculation of `mod_x` and `mod_y` is not correct. The condition for \(a_i + a_j\) to be divisible by `x` should be checked using the sum of the remainders, and the condition for \(a_i - a_j\) should be checked using the difference of the remainders.

3. **Dictionary Update**: The program updates the dictionaries with the current element's modulo values before checking the conditions, which can lead to incorrect counts.

To fix these issues, the program should correctly check for both conditions for each pair of elements in the array. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if (arr[i] + arr[j]) % x == 0 and (arr[i] - arr[j]) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) and checks both conditions explicitly. If both conditions are satisfied, it increments the `count` variable. This approach ensures that the program correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
