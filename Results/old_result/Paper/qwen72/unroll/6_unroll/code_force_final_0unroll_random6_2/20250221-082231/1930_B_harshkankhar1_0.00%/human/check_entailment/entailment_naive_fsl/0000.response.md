Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem. Specifically, the permutation generated by the program does not always ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

For example, consider the input \(n = 4\). The program generates the permutation \([4, 1, 2, 3]\). However, this permutation is not valid because:

- For \(i = 1\) and \(j = 3\), \(p_1 = 4\) divides \(p_3 = 2\) and \(p_2 = 1\) divides \(p_4 = 3\).

Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for this input.
