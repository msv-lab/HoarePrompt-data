### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `lit` itself.

2. **Subsequence Splitting Logic:**
   - The program initializes two empty lists `a` and `b` to hold the subsequences.
   - It iterates over the elements of `lit` and decides which subsequence to append the current element to based on the last elements of `a` and `b`.
   - The conditions for appending to `a` or `b` are:
     - If `x > y` (last element of `a` is greater than the last element of `b`):
       - If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `y`, it is appended to `b`.
       - If `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, it is appended to `b`.
       - If `lit[i]` is between `x` and `y`, it is appended to `a`.
     - If `x == y`:
       - `lit[i]` is appended to `a`.
     - If `x < y`:
       - If `lit[i]` is less than or equal to `x`, it is appended to `a`.
       - If `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, it is appended to `a`.
       - If `lit[i]` is between `y` and `x`, it is appended to `b`.

3. **Penalty Calculation:**
   - After distributing the elements, the program calculates the penalty for each subsequence by counting the number of increasing pairs.
   - The total penalty is the sum of the penalties of `a` and `b`.
   - The total penalty is printed for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` or `b` is empty by initializing `x` and `y` to `float('inf')` when the respective list is empty.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is 1, which means there are no increasing pairs, and the penalty is 0.

5. **Optimality:**
   - The logic for distributing elements between `a` and `b` is not optimal. The conditions provided do not ensure that the penalty is minimized.
   - For example, in the first test case, the optimal split is `s=[1,2,3,4,5]` and `t=[\,]`, which results in a penalty of 0, but the program might not achieve this split due to the conditions provided.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty. The conditions for appending elements to `a` and `b` are flawed and do not guarantee the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
