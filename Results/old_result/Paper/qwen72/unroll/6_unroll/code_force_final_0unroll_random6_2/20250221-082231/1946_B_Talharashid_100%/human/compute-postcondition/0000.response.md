The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if the input provided by `int(input())` is greater than 0. The value of `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
