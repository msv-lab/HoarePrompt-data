You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, the function splits the list `a` into two halves, sorts them, and then prints pairs of duplicate elements from each half and single elements from the first half, up to `k` elements in total for each half. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the program ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the list `lst` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into two halves: `lft` (first half) and `rgt` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted. This is a good step because it helps in identifying pairs of duplicate elements more easily.

4. **Identifying Pairs and Singles:**
   - The function uses two lists, `ldb` and `rdb`, to store pairs of duplicate elements from `lft` and `rgt` respectively.
   - It also uses a list `sng` to store single elements from `lft` that do not have a duplicate immediately next to them.

5. **Constructing the Subsets:**
   - The function constructs the subsets `l` and `r` by first trying to add pairs of duplicate elements from `ldb` and `rdb` to ensure the XOR condition.
   - If there are not enough pairs, it adds single elements from `sng` to complete the subsets.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Handling Pairs:**
  - The code correctly identifies pairs of duplicate elements in `lft` and `rgt` and adds them to `ldb` and `rdb` respectively.
  - It then prints these pairs to form the subsets `l` and `r`.

- **Handling Singles:**
  - The code correctly identifies single elements in `lft` and adds them to `sng`.
  - It then prints these single elements to complete the subsets `l` and `r`.

- **XOR Condition:**
  - The XOR condition is satisfied by ensuring that the subsets `l` and `r` are constructed from the same elements (either pairs or singles).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The code handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by ensuring that it prints the required number of elements.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by ensuring that it prints the required number of pairs and singles.

### Potential Issues:
- **Single Elements in `sng`:**
  - The code only adds single elements from `lft` to `sng`, but it does not add single elements from `rgt`. This could lead to a situation where `sng` does not contain enough elements to complete the subsets `l` and `r` if `k` is large.

- **Subset Length:**
  - The code ensures that the subsets `l` and `r` have exactly `2k` elements, but it does not explicitly check if the XOR condition is met after constructing the subsets. However, since the problem guarantees that a solution always exists, this is not a critical issue.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct and follows the problem description. However, it has a minor issue with handling single elements from `rgt`. Despite this, the program should still produce valid subsets `l` and `r` that satisfy the XOR condition for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
