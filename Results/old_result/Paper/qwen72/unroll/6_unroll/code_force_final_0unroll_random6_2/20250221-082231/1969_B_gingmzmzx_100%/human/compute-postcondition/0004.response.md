Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from the input, processes it to compute a value `ans`, and prints `ans`. The value `ans` represents the sum of the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1' in the string `s`. After processing all `n` test cases, the function terminates, and the final state is that `n` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset for each test case. **
