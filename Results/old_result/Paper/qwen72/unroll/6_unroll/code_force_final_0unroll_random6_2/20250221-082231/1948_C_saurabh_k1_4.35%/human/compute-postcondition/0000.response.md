The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The `range` function depends on the input provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state provided before the loop starts does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it does describe the conditions for the function parameters.

Given the task, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. Therefore, the input to the `range` function should be `t`, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
