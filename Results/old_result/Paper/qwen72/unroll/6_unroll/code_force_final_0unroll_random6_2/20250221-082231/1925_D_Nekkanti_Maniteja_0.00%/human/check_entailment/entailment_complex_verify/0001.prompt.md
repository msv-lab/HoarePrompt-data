You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

    #State: For each test case, the final value of `s` is calculated and printed as `s % M`, where `M` is \(10^9 + 7\). The value of `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the loop iterates `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` edges, each defined by three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It calculates a value `s` based on these inputs and prints `s % M`, where `M` is \(10^9 + 7\). The value of `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`, with `c` being the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and initializes the modulus `M` to \(10^9 + 7\).
   - It calculates the inverse of the total number of possible pairs \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and stores it in `c`.

2. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 0, which will store the expected sum of friendship values.
   - It initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of initial friendship values.

3. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values.
   - It correctly adds the initial friendship values to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over `k` excursions.
   - For each excursion, it updates the expected sum `s` by adding the contribution of the current excursion.
   - The contribution of the current excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` accounts for the expected increase in friendship value due to the current excursion.
     - `c * a` accounts for the expected value of the initial friendship values.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program ensures that the final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `s % M`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Contribution Calculation:**
  - The term `c * i * c * m` is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion should be `c * m` (since each pair of friends has a probability of `c` of being chosen, and there are `m` such pairs).
  - The term `c * a` is also incorrect. The expected value of the initial friendship values should be `c * a` for each excursion, but the sum should be `c * a * k` because the initial friendship values contribute to each of the `k` excursions.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected the total number of pairs
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * m  # Corrected the contribution of the current excursion
        s = (s + c * a * k) % M  # Corrected the contribution of initial friendship values
        print(s)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the expected value calculation.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected sum of friendship values for each excursion and the initial friendship values.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
