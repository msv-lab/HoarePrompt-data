The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `n`, so for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `dp` is a list containing the values [1, 1], which does not need to be adjusted as it is not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `dp` is a list containing the values [1, 1]**
