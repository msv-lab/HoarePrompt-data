Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by cyclically shifting substrings. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes `ans` to store the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of 0s in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one 1 before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of 1s in `cnt` and adds the number of remaining zeroes (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

The logic of the program is based on the observation that to make the string sorted, we need to move all 1s to the right of all 0s. The cost is calculated by considering the number of 1s that need to be moved past each 0 and the number of 0s that need to be moved past each 1.

This approach ensures that the minimum total cost is calculated correctly for each test case, and the program handles the constraints and input format as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
