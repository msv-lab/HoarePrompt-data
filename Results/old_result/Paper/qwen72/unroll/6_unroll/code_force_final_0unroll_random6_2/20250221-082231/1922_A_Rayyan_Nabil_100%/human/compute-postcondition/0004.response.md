Output State: `t` is the same input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration of the loop.
