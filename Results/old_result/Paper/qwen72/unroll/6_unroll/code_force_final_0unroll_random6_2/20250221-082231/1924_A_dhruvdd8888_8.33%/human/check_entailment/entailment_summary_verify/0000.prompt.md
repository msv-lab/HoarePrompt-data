You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It takes three inputs: `n`, `k`, and `m`, where `n` and `k` are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 26, 1 ≤ k ≤ 26) and `m` is the length of a string `s` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) that consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function then processes the string `s` to find substrings that contain all `k` unique characters. If the number of such substrings found is at least `n`, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and, for each unique character in the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in the last found substring, it prints a string formed by concatenating the characters in the list of last found substrings, followed by the unique character, and then 'a' repeated `n - len(ans) - 1` times. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, and `ps` as described in the annotations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. The program only checks if a window of characters in `s` contains all `k` characters at least once, and then it tries to build a string of length `n` based on this window. This approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible combinations of the first `k` characters of length `n`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
**Input:**
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
abc
```

In the third test case, the program incorrectly prints `abc` as a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `aabbccabab`. However, `abc` is a subsequence of `aabbccabab`. The correct output should be `ccc` or any other string of length 3 formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets that does not occur as a subsequence in `aabbccabab`.

The program fails to correctly identify and print a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` when the answer is `NO`.
