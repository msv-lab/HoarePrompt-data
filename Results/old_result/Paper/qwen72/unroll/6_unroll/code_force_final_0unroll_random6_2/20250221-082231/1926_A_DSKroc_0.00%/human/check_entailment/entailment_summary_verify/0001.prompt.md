You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from standard input. The first line of input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a distinct string of length 5 with letters 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters in the string. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'A' if the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters in the last test case, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, correctly iterating over each test case.

3. **Counting Characters**: Inside the loop, the program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero. These counters are used to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string `s`.

4. **Reading the String**: The program reads the string `s` for each test case using `s = input()`. This is correct as it matches the problem description.

5. **Character Counting Logic**: The program iterates over each character in the string `s` and increments the appropriate counter (`ac` for 'A' and `bc` for 'B'). This logic is correct and matches the problem requirements.

6. **Output Logic**: After counting the characters for a test case, the program checks if `ac` is greater than `bc`. If `ac` is greater, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic is correct for determining which character appears more frequently.

7. **Indentation Issue**: However, the program has an indentation issue. The `if ac > bc:` block should be inside the loop that iterates over the test cases. Currently, it is outside the loop, which means it will only print the result for the last test case.

8. **Correct Indentation**: To fix this, the `if ac > bc:` block should be indented to be inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

Given the original program's indentation issue, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
