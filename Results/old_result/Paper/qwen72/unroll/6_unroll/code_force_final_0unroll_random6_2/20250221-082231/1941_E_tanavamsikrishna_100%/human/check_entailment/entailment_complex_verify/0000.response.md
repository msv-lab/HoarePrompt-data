### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). Let's analyze the program and the annotations to see if this is accurate.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `row[0] = 1`: This sets the cost of the first support to 1, which is correct because the depth at the first cell is 0, and the cost is \(0 + 1 = 1\).
   - `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2`: This increases the cost of the first \(d-1\) cells by 2. This is correct because the cost of installing a support in these cells is \(a_{i,j} + 1\), and the initial cost is \(a_{i,j}\).

2. **Heap Initialization:**
   - `min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]`: This creates a min-heap of the first \(d\) elements of the row, which is correct for the initial window of size \(d\).
   - `heapify(min_heap)`: This converts the list into a valid min-heap.

3. **Sliding Window Update:**
   - `for i in range(d, len(row))`: This iterates over the remaining elements of the row.
   - `while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2)`: This ensures that the heap only contains elements within the current window of size \(d\). The condition `<= i - (d + 2)` is used to remove elements that are out of the range of the current window.
   - `row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1`: This updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of installing a support in the current cell.
   - `heappush(min_heap, e)`: This re-inserts the minimum element back into the heap.
   - `heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))`: This adds the updated cost of the current cell to the heap.

4. **Return Value:**
   - `return row[-1]`: This returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of building a bridge in that row.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))`: This reads the number of rows, columns, bridges, and maximum distance between supports.
   - `rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]`: This reads the depths of the river cells for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - `costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]`: This calculates the cost of building a bridge for each row using `func_1`.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - `total_costs = []`: This initializes an empty list to store the total costs of building \(k\) consecutive bridges.
   - `for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1))`: This iterates over the possible starting rows for building \(k\) consecutive bridges.
   - `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))`: This calculates the total cost for each possible set of \(k\) consecutive rows and appends it to `total_costs`.

4. **Output:**
   - `print(min(total_costs))`: This prints the minimum total cost of building \(k\) consecutive bridges.

### Evaluation:
- **Condition Enforcement:**
  - The function `func_1` ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than \(d\) by using a sliding window approach with a min-heap. The heap is updated to only contain elements within the current window of size \(d\), and the cost of each cell is updated based on the minimum cost within this window.
  - The condition `|j_1 - j_2| - 1 \leq d` is effectively enforced because the heap only contains elements within the current window of size \(d\).

- **Correctness of Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation in `func_1` is correct. It sets the first support cost to 1, increases the cost of the first \(d-1\) cells by 2, and then updates the remaining cells based on the minimum cost within the sliding window.
  - The total cost calculation in `func_2` is also correct. It sums the costs of \(k\) consecutive rows and finds the minimum sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\) and correctly calculates the minimum total cost of building \(k\) consecutive bridges.

Final: **True**
