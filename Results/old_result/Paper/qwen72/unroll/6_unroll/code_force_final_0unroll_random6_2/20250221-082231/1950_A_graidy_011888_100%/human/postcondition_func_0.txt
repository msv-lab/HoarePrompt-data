The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (each between 0 and 9) from the user. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b` and `b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After all iterations, the function completes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `n` iterations have been processed, and the appropriate output has been printed for each set of input digits.
