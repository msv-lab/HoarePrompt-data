The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the start and end indices of a sublist within `lst`. This sublist is chosen such that the sum of the elements outside the sublist plus the square of the length of the sublist is maximized. The function ensures that `r` and `l` are the indices that achieve this maximum sum, and `over_sum` holds the maximum value of this sum.
