The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` representing the number of outcomes, followed by a list of integers `a` representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. It calculates a list of bets such that the sum of these bets is strictly less than the product of the multipliers (LCM of the multipliers). If such a distribution is possible, it prints the list of bets as a space-separated string. If no such distribution is possible, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, `bets`, and `a` will have their final values from the last test case.
