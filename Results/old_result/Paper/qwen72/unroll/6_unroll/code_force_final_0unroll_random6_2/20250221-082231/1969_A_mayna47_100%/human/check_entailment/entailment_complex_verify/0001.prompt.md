You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
    print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if v[v[i]] == i:
            print(2)
            return
        
    #State: The loop will either print 2 and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything. The values of t, n, p, and v remain unchanged.
    print(3)
    #This is printed: 3
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user and a list of `n` integers from the user. It then checks if for any index `i` in the range `[1, n]`, the value at `v[v[i]]` equals `i`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and returns. If no such index is found, the function prints `3` and returns. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `p` (though `p` is not used in the function). The final state of the program is that the function has printed either `2` or `3` and has returned.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The best friend relationships are given by the array `p` where `p[i]` is the best friend of friend `i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the best friend relationships `v`.
   - It then checks for pairs of friends `(i, v[i])` where `v[v[i]] == i`, which means friend `i` and friend `v[i]` are each other's best friends.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, as sending invitations to both friends in the pair will ensure that both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, which is the default case.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Case 1: Pairs of Best Friends**
     - If there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, the program correctly prints `2` because sending invitations to both friends in the pair ensures that both will come to the party.
   - **Case 2: No Pairs of Best Friends**
     - If there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program prints `3`. This is not always correct. For example, if `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the correct answer should be `3` because inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 will ensure that friends 1 and 2 come to the party. However, the program does not consider the possibility of inviting more than 2 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where `n = 2` and the friends are not each other's best friends. For example, if `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`, the program will print `2` which is correct.
   - However, if `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]` is not the case, the program will print `3` which is incorrect. For example, if `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]` is not the case, the correct answer should be `2`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations needed is more than 2 but less than 3.
