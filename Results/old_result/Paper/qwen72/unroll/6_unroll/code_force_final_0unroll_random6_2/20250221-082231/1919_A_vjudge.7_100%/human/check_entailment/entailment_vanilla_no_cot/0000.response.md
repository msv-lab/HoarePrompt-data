Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given Python program is incorrect because it misinterprets the game logic. The program checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd to determine the winner. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach involves understanding that the game is essentially about the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of coins each player has. The key points are:

1. If both players have an even number of coins, Bob will always win because Alice will be forced to make the first move to an odd number of coins, and then Bob can always mirror Alice's moves.
2. If both players have an odd number of coins, Alice will always win because she can make the first move to an even number of coins, and then she can always mirror Bob's moves.
3. If one player has an even number of coins and the other has an odd number of coins, the player with the odd number of coins will always win because they can always force the game into a state where the opponent has an even number of coins, and then they can mirror the opponent's moves.

The program should check the parity of `a` and `b` separately to determine the winner, not the sum of `a` and `b`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This version correctly checks the parity of the number of coins each player has and determines the winner based on the rules of the game.
