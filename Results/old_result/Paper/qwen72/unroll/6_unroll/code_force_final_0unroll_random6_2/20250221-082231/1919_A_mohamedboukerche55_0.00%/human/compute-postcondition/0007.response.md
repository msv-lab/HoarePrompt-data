The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000. `a` and `b` are integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, with the constraint 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the result for each test case, indicating whether Alice or Bob has more coins, or if they have the same number of coins.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It returns the result for each test case indicating if Alice has more coins, Bob has more coins, or if they have the same number of coins.**
