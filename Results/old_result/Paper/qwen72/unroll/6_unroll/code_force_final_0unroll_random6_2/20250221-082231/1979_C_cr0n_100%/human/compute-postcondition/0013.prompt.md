You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, vals is a list of integers of length N where each element k_i satisfies 2 <= k_i <= 20.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `vals`. The list `vals` remains unchanged.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: - Since the `print` statement is printing a constant value `-1`, the output will be `-1`.
        #
        #Output:
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list `vals` minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`, `vals` remains unchanged, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: - The elements in `vprod` are calculated as `den / vals[i]` for each `i` in the range of `vals`.
    #   - Since `den` is the GCD of `vals`, each element in `vprod` will be an integer.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `None`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
