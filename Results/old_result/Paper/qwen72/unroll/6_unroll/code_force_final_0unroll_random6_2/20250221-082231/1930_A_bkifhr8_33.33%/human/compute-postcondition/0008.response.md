Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` lines of input, each containing a list of 2n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, the function calculates the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the input list and appends this sum to a result list `ans_f`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element in `ans_f`, which contains `t` elements, each being the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the corresponding input list. The function does not return any value. **
