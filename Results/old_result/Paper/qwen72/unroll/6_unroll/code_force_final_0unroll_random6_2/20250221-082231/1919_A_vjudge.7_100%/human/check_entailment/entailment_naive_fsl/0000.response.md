Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program contains a logical error in the condition `if a + b & 1 == 0:`. The bitwise AND operator `&` has higher precedence than the addition operator `+`, so the expression `a + b & 1` is evaluated as `a + (b & 1)`. This is incorrect because the intended operation is to check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, which should be written as `(a + b) & 1 == 0`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  1 2
  ```
- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Alice
  ```
- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  Bob
  ```

In this case, the sum of `a` and `b` is `3`, which is odd. The correct output should be "Alice" because the sum is odd. However, the program incorrectly evaluates `1 + 2 & 1` as `1 + 0` (since `2 & 1` is `0`), which is `1`, and then checks `1 == 0`, which is `False`. Therefore, it incorrectly prints "Alice" instead of "Bob".

The correct condition should be:
```python
if (a + b) & 1 == 0:
```

This ensures that the sum of `a` and `b` is correctly evaluated before checking if it is even.
