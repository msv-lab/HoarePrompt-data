Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Base Case (n == k)**: 
   - If `n` equals `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up one stall with a price of 1 coin per jewel. This is correct because Alice will spend all `k` coins on `k` jewels, and the function prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1.

3. **Second Case (n + 2 > k * 2)**:
   - If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the function prints "YES" followed by 2 and the values `n - k + 1` and 1.
   - This condition ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up two stalls. The first stall has a price of `n - k + 1` coins per jewel, and the second stall has a price of 1 coin per jewel.
   - Alice will buy one jewel from the first stall, spending `n - k + 1` coins, and then she will have `k - 1` coins left. She will then buy `k - 1` jewels from the second stall, spending `k - 1` coins, which totals to `k` jewels.
   - This logic is correct because `n - k + 1` ensures that Alice can buy exactly one jewel from the first stall, and the remaining coins are exactly `k - 1`, which she can spend on the second stall.

4. **Third Case (n + 2 <= k * 2)**:
   - If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, the function prints "NO".
   - This condition checks if it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. If `n + 2` is less than or equal to `k * 2`, it means that even if Alice buys one jewel from each of two stalls, she will not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels. This is a valid check to determine impossibility.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum (1) and maximum (10^18) values correctly.
   - For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the function correctly prints "YES" followed by 1 and 1.
   - If `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the function correctly prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy 2 jewels with only 1 coin.

6. **General Correctness**:
   - The function ensures that the number of stalls is always 1 or 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.
   - The prices set for the stalls are always valid (1 ≤ price ≤ 10^18).

Given the above reasoning, the function `func` correctly handles all the requirements and edge cases of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
