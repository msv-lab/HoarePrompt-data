Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the removal of elements from the array and the calculation of the product modulo `m` for each command. Specifically, the logic for updating the indices `q1` and `q2` is flawed, leading to incorrect results in several cases.

Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 2 4 1
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
0 2 4 4
```

The issue arises because the program does not correctly track the indices of the elements being removed. For example, when the command is 'L', the program should remove the leftmost element and update the product accordingly. However, the logic for updating `q1` and `q2` does not correctly handle this, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should use a more straightforward approach to track the current state of the array and the product modulo `m` for each command.
