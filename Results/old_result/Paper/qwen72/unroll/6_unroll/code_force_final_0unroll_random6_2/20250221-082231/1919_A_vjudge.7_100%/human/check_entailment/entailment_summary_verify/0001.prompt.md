You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    1 4
    
    5 3
    
    4 5

    1000000000 1000000000
    
    53110 2024

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Bob

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Bob
    
Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program:
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `test` indicating the number of test cases (1 <= test <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that the loop has completed, and the output for each test case has been printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the other or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the decision, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game is essentially a turn-based game where each player can remove one coin per turn.
   - The total number of coins \( a + b \) is crucial. If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a draw if both players play optimally, but since the game must have a winner, Bob will win because he will be the one to make the last move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will win because she will be the one to make the last move.

3. **Bitwise Operation:**
   - The condition \( a + b \) & 1 == 0 checks if the sum \( a + b \) is even.
   - If \( a + b \) is even, the result of the bitwise AND operation with 1 will be 0.
   - If \( a + b \) is odd, the result of the bitwise AND operation with 1 will be 1.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It then checks if \( a + b \) is even using the bitwise AND operation.
   - If \( a + b \) is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If \( a + b \) is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input \( (1, 1) \), \( a + b = 2 \) (even), so the output should be "Bob".
   - For the input \( (1, 4) \), \( a + b = 5 \) (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
   - For the input \( (5, 3) \), \( a + b = 8 \) (even), so the output should be "Bob".
   - For the input \( (4, 5) \), \( a + b = 9 \) (odd), so the output should be "Alice".
   - These match the expected outputs in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
