You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: row is a list of non-negative integers representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, with row[0] and row[-1] being 0 (river banks). d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row).
def func_1(row, d):
    row[0] = 1
    for i in range(1, d):
        row[i] = row[i] + 2
        
    #State: `row` is a list of non-negative integers with `row[0]` set to 1, `row[-1]` is 0, and each element in `row` from index 1 to index `d-1` is increased by 2. The value of `d` remains unchanged.
    min_heap = [(e, i) for i, e in enumerate(row[:d])]
    heapify(min_heap)
    for i in range(d, len(row)):
        while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
            pass
        
        row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
        
        heappush(min_heap, e)
        
        heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))
        
    #State: `row` is updated for indices from `d` to `len(row) - 1` based on the smallest element in `min_heap` within a certain range, and `min_heap` is a valid heap containing all elements of `row` and their indices.
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest element in `min_heap` within a certain range.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers representing river depths with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It updates the list `row` based on the smallest element in a `min_heap` within a certain range and returns the last element of the updated list `row`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the last element of the list `row`, which has been updated based on the smallest element in `min_heap` within a certain range.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
