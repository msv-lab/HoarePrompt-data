### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Case Handling:**
   - **Case 1: `k == n`**
     - If `k` equals `n`, the function prints an array of `n` ones.
     - This is correct because an array of `n` ones will have all `n` cyclic shifts sorted, as each shift will still be an array of ones.
   - **Case 2: `k == 1`**
     - If `k` equals 1, the function prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
     - This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` will have exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the array itself. All other cyclic shifts will not be sorted.
   - **Case 3: `k != n` and `k != 1`**
     - If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, the function prints `-1`.
     - This is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. There are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts for such cases.

3. **General Case:**
   - The function does not handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `1 < k < n`. It only handles the edge cases where `k` equals `n` or `1`.

### Correctness:
**False**
