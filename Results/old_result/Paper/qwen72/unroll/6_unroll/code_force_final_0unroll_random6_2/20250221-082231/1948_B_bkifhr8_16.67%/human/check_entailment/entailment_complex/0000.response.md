### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program attempts to simulate the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10 into their digits.
   - It iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After simulating the operation, the program uses the function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - The function `func_1` correctly compares the original list with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating the list is sorted.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array is already sorted correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements less than 10, as it only splits elements that are at least 10.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the operation needs to be applied multiple times to achieve a sorted array. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split the first element and then check if the array is sorted. However, it might need to split the third element as well to achieve a sorted array.
   - The program does not ensure that the array is checked for sorting after each split operation. It only checks once after the first pass through the array.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where multiple split operations are required to sort the array. It only performs one pass through the array and checks for sorting, which is insufficient for all test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
