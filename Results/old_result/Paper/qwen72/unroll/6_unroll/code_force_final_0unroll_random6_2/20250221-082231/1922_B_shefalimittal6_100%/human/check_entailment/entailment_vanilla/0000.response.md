### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks `a_i`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the stick lengths and increments the corresponding index in `v`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - It initializes `cnt` to keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - It iterates through the list `v` to calculate the number of ways to form a triangle:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and pairs them with any of the previously counted sticks.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these.
     - It updates `cnt` with the count of the current stick length.

4. **Output:**
   - It appends the result for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:

- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller sticks (e.g., \(2^a + 2^b\) where \(a < b\)) will never be greater than the largest stick (e.g., \(2^c\) where \(c > a\) and \(c > b\)).

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a triangle is if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length.
  - It correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a set of sticks with the same length using combinatorial formulas.
  - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from a set of sticks with the same length and pairs them with any of the previously counted sticks.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by outputting 0.
  - It also handles the case where there are multiple test cases and large inputs within the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program is logically correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given sticks.

### Correctness:
**True**
