Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The function `func` has processed all `t` test cases. For each test case, the final value of `ans` is printed as an integer. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values, and the loop counter `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`. The variable `count` for each test case ends with a value that is either `m + 1` or the value where `g < count - 1` condition breaks the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes up to 10,000 test cases, where each test case involves two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6). For each test case, it calculates a value `ans` based on the inputs `n` and `m` and prints the final integer value of `ans`. The function ensures that the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` retain their initial values, while the loop counter `i` has completed all iterations from 0 to `t-1`.
