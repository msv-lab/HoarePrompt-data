The function `func` reads an integer `test` indicating the number of test cases (1 <= test <= 1000). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program is that the loop has completed, and the output for each test case has been printed to the console.
