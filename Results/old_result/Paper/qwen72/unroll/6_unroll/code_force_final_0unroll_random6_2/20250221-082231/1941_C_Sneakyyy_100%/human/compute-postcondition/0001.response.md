Output State: **For each test case, the variable `ans` will hold the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the string `a` or one less than the length of the string `a` if the last two characters do not form a valid substring to check. The values of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged. The string `s` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.**
