Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the size of the remaining board `n`.

2. **Processing Initial Moves**:
   - For each initial move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the row and column are blocked.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only one diagonal is blocked.
   - This logic is correct as it accurately reflects the constraints of the problem.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` chessboard.
   - It uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of configurations.
   - The `dp` list is initialized with `[1, 1]` which represents the base cases:
     - `dp[0] = 1` (0 rooks on a 0x0 board has 1 configuration, the empty board).
     - `dp[1] = 1` (1 rook on a 1x1 board has 1 configuration, placing the rook on the only cell).
   - For each subsequent value of `i` from 2 to `n`, it updates the `dp` list using the formula:
     - `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`
     - This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board by considering:
       - Placing no rook in the new row and column: `dp[i-1]`
       - Placing one rook in the new row and column, and the rest in the remaining `(i-2) x (i-2)` board: `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]`
   - The result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.
   - The `dp` list is maintained as a rolling list of the last two values to optimize space.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach and the handling of initial moves are both sound and align with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
