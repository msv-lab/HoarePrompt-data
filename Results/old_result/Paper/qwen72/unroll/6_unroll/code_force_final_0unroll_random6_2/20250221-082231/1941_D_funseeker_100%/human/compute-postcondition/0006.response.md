Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, `ans` is a set containing all unique values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial `ans` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, excluding the value 0, and now also includes `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.add(n)` adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a set containing unique values generated by specific operations, and now `n` is added to this set, the output state reflects that `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged, while `ans` now includes `n` in addition to its previous contents.
