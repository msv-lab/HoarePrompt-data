#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. The function should return a list of n integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '

    #State: The function `func` will have processed `t` test cases. For each test case, if a valid distribution of bets is possible such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, the function will print a space-separated list of `n` integers representing the bets. If no such distribution is possible, the function will print -1. The variables `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, `bets`, and `a` will have their final values after processing all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `bets` representing the number of outcomes, followed by a list of integers `a` representing the multipliers for the winning outcomes. It calculates a list of bets such that the sum of these bets is strictly less than the product of the multipliers (LCM of the multipliers). If such a distribution is possible, it prints the list of bets as a space-separated string. If no such distribution is possible, it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `t`, `T`, `prod`, `sumo`, `bets`, and `a` will have their final values from the last test case.
