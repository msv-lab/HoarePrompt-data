The function `func_1` accepts a list `row` of non-negative integers representing river depths, with the first and last elements being 0, and a positive integer `d` such that 1 <= d < len(row). It updates the list `row` by setting the first element to 1, increasing the elements from index 1 to index d-1 by 2, and then updating the elements from index d to the end based on the smallest element in a min-heap within a certain range. The function returns the last element of the updated list `row`.
