The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`. It then ensures that the modified list `a` contains unique elements by inserting additional elements as necessary, while maintaining the total length of the list as `n`. The final list `ans` is printed, containing all unique elements from the modified list `a` and any additional elements needed to ensure the list length is `n`. The function does not return any value.
