Output State: **`results` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of pairs in the corresponding test case's array `arr` such that the first element of the pair, when negated and taken modulo `x`, and the second element of the pair, when taken modulo `y`, both result in values that have been previously seen in the array. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.**
