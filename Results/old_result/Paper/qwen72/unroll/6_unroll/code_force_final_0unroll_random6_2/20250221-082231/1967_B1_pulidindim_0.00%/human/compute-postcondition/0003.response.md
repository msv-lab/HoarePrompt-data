The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` must satisfy 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^6. The function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` for each of up to 10^4 test cases, ensuring that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
