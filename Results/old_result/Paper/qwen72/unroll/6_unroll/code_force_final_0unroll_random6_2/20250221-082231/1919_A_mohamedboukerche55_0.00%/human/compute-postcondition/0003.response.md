Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten with the last input values for `a` and `b` from the loop.
- `i` will be equal to `t-1` (where `t` is the number of test cases).
- The sum of `a` and `b` is even.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('bob  ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'bob  '`.
- The values of `a`, `b`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement, so their values do not affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'bob  '` exactly as it is written in the code.

Output: **bob  **
