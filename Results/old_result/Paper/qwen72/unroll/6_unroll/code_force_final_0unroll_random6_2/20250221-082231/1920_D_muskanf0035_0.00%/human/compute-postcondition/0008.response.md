Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple represents an operation type and a value, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It modifies an internal array based on the operations provided: if the operation type is 1, it appends the value to the array; if the operation type is 2, it duplicates the array by extending it with its current elements. After processing all operations, the function returns a list `result` containing the elements from the array at the indices `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The final state of the program includes the modified array and the returned `result` list. **
