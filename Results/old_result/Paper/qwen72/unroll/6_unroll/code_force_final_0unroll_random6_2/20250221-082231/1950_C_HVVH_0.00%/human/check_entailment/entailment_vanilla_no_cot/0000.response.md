Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the program for determining whether the time is AM or PM is flawed. Specifically, the `else` block incorrectly sets the `day` to 'PM' for all hours between 1 and 11, and then immediately changes it back to 'AM' if the hour is 12. This results in incorrect AM/PM assignments for hours 1 through 11. The correct logic should be:

- If the hour is 0, it should be 12 AM.
- If the hour is between 1 and 11, it should be AM.
- If the hour is 12, it should be PM.
- If the hour is between 13 and 23, it should be PM, and the hour should be adjusted by subtracting 12.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        if h == 0:
            h = 12
            day = 'AM'
        elif h < 12:
            day = 'AM'
        else:
            day = 'PM'
            if h > 12:
                h = h - 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

This corrected version will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
