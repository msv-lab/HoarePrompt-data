The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a binary string s (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
