Output State: `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from the standard input stream, `idx` is the index after the last element used in the loop, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list of strings, each representing the number of ways to pick 2 or 3 identical elements from the sublists defined by the input.

To break it down:
- `data` remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- `idx` will be the index of the element in `data` that comes right after the last element used in the loop.
- `t` remains the same as it is the number of test cases.
- `results` will contain the calculated answers for each test case, where each answer is a string representing the number of ways to pick 2 or 3 identical elements from the sublists defined by the input.
