Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the values of `n` and `k` have been read from the input. The loop has printed 'YES' followed by 1 and 1 if `n` equals `k`, printed 'YES' followed by 2 and the values `n - k + 1` and 1 if `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, and printed 'NO' otherwise. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are unchanged after the loop, but the input stream has been consumed for `t` lines.**
