### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, the amount received back is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It sets \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\) for each outcome \(i\).
   - The total amount bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - If \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \geq \text{LCM}\), it prints \(-1\) indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - The LCM is calculated correctly using the `gcd` function in the `lcm` function.
     - The LCM ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and that \(k_i \times x_i = \text{LCM}\) for each \(i\).
   - **Bets Calculation:**
     - The bets \(x_i\) are calculated as \(x_i = \text{LCM} / k_i\), which ensures that the return for each winning outcome is \(\text{LCM}\).
   - **Sum of Bets:**
     - The sum of the bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is calculated and compared to the LCM.
     - If \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \geq \text{LCM}\), it prints \(-1\), which is correct because it means there is no valid distribution.
     - If \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \text{LCM}\), it prints the bets, which is also correct.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where the sum of bets is equal to the LCM by printing \(-1\), which is correct.
     - The program also handles the case where the multipliers are all the same (e.g., \(k_1 = k_2 = \ldots = k_n\)) by correctly printing \(-1\) when the sum of bets equals the LCM.
   - **Constraints:**
     - The program ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers and within the range \(1 \le x_i \le 10^9\), which is valid as per the problem constraints.

4. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
   - The initial state before the function call is accurately described.
   - The final state after processing all test cases is accurately described.
   - The logic and calculations within the function are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets and checks the condition as required by the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
