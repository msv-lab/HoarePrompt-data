The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `piles`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `piles` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. Each inner list has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and each integer `a_i` in the inner list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the initial number of stones in the piles, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the initial number of stones in the piles.**
