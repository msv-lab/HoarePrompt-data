The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. Each integer in `lst` is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is equal to its sorted version `sorted_lst`. This means it returns `True` if `lst` was already sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.
