You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are input variables. The variables `a`, `b`, `o`, `n`, `f`, `k`, `fav`, `dic`, and `l` are re-initialized and updated in each iteration of the loop, but their final values after the loop depends on the last iteration's input. The loop prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs and processes each set to determine if a specific condition is met. For each set, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `a` and another list of integers `o`. It then checks if the favorite element (determined by the index `f-1` in `o`) can be within the top `k` elements of `o` when sorted in descending order. The function prints 'YES' if the favorite element is within the top `k` elements, 'NO' if it is not, and 'MAYBE' if it is within the top `k` but the condition is ambiguous. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. The input variables `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are re-read for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes and could be in a position that is not removed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the favorite cube will always be removed if it is within the first `k` positions after sorting, without considering the possibility that other cubes with the same value might be removed instead.

Example Case:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

Output:
YES
```

Expected Output:
```
MAYBE
```

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) shows the value 3. After sorting, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, where the favorite cube could be in the second, third, or fourth position. If the favorite cube is in the second position, it will be removed. If it is in the third or fourth position, it will not be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE," but the program outputs "YES."
