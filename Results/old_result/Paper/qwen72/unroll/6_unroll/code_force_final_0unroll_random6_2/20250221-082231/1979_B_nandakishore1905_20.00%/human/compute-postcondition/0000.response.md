The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `x` and `y` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9 and x ≠ y, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
