The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer with the constraint 1 <= t <= 1000, it is already ensured that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**
