### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The program provided simply sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \) and prints it for each test case.

Let's analyze why this approach works:

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1. This is because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are always coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1).

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) when \( y = x - 1 \) is \( 1 + (x - 1) = x \).

3. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - For any \( y \) in the range \( 1 \le y < x \), the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) will be at most \( x \) because \(\gcd(x, y) \le x\) and \( y < x \). Therefore, the maximum possible sum is \( x \), which is achieved when \( y = x - 1 \).

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which is the value of \( y \) that maximizes the sum \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Given this reasoning, the program is correct for the problem description.
