### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads input from standard input using `[*open(0)]`, which is a shorthand for reading all lines from standard input. It then processes every third line starting from the third line, which corresponds to the lines containing the card values for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each line, it splits the line into tokens using `line.split()`. This creates a list of card values.
   - It then calculates the difference between the number of tokens in the line and the number of unique tokens using `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result of this calculation for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally, given that Nene also plays optimally.
   - The function calculates the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards. This difference represents the number of duplicate cards in your hand.
   - Each duplicate card in your hand can potentially give you a point if Nene does not have the matching card and you play it after the first one. However, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.
   - The function's logic is incorrect because it does not account for Nene's optimal play. It simply counts the number of duplicates, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum points you can get.

### Example Analysis:
- **First Test Case:**
  - Input: `1 1 2 3`
  - Unique cards: `{1, 2, 3}`
  - Duplicates: `1` (the card `1` appears twice)
  - The function will output `1`, which is correct in this case, but this is coincidental.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - Input: `7 4 1 2 8 8 5 5`
  - Unique cards: `{7, 4, 1, 2, 8, 5}`
  - Duplicates: `2` (the cards `8` and `5` appear twice)
  - The function will output `2`, which is correct in this case, but again, this is coincidental.

- **Third Test Case:**
  - Input: `7 1 4 5 3 4 2 6`
  - Unique cards: `{7, 1, 4, 5, 3, 2, 6}`
  - Duplicates: `1` (the card `4` appears twice)
  - The function will output `1`, which is correct in this case, but the reasoning is still flawed.

- **Fourth Test Case:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Unique cards: `{1, 2, 3}`
  - Duplicates: `0`
  - The function will output `0`, which is correct.

- **Fifth Test Case:**
  - Input: `1`
  - Unique cards: `{1}`
  - Duplicates: `0`
  - The function will output `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function's logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal play of Nene. The function simply counts the number of duplicates, which is not the correct approach to determine the maximum points you can get. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
