Output State: **`lst` is updated such that the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is now filled with the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`), `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation, and the last two elements of `ops` are `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced with a list containing `n` elements, each of which is the value `n`.
- The value of `n` is `l - r + 1`, which is the length of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`.
- The values of `r`, `l`, and `ops` remain unchanged.
- The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` was 0, but now all elements in this sublist are `n`, which is a positive integer because `l - r + 1` is always positive given the constraints.
