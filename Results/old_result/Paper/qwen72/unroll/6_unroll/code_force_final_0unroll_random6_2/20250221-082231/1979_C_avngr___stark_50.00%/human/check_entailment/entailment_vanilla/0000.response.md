### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given multiple test cases, each with a set of multipliers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
   - We need to distribute coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome \( k_i \cdot x_i \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \( m = \prod_{i=1}^{n} k_i \).
   - It then calculates the bets \( c_i \) as \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - The highest common factor (HCF) of the bets \( c \) is computed using the `func_1` function.
   - Each bet \( c_i \) is then divided by the HCF to ensure the bets are as small as possible.
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) is strictly less than \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \). If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The product \( m \) is used to ensure that the bets \( c_i \) are proportional to the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - Dividing each \( c_i \) by the HCF ensures that the bets are the smallest possible integers that satisfy the proportionality.
   - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \) ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, the HCF will be \( k_i \) itself, and the sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) will be \( n \), which is not less than \( \frac{m}{k_i} = k_i^{n-1} \). This is correctly handled by the program.
   - If the multipliers are different, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the HCF, which is efficient.
   - The product \( m \) can be large, but the program handles it by dividing by the HCF, ensuring the bets are within the required constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if the condition is satisfied. It handles edge cases and ensures the bets are within the required constraints.

Correctness: **True**
