### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes and their sizes, processes them using `func_2`, and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to find the index of the first element in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1, which is a valid edge case.
   - If `a[inx]` is equal to `x`, it returns `inx + 1`, which is the correct index plus 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`, which is the index where `a[inx]` is the first element greater than `x`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is designed to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, considering only the left-to-right direction.
   - It initializes `left` with a cumulative sum of elements in `a` and `last` with the indices of the last occurrence of a different element before the current index.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and updates the `ans` list based on the following conditions:
     - If the current slime is smaller than the previous slime, it sets `ans[i]` to 1, indicating it will be eaten in the next second.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the cumulative sum of sizes up to the current slime and subtracts the current slime's size and 1 to find the target size `x`.
     - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` where the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - It also uses the `last` list to find the last occurrence of a different element before the current index, `inx2`.
     - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, it updates `inx` to `inx2`.
     - If `inx` is valid (not less than 0), it calculates the minimum number of seconds for the current slime to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The main loop calls `func_2` twice: once with the original list `a` and once with the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results from both calls to ensure the minimum number of seconds is considered from both directions.
   - If either direction results in -1, it takes the maximum value (which will be -1 if both are -1).
   - Otherwise, it takes the minimum value.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no slimes that can be eaten or when the list is empty.
   - The use of `bisect_left` and the cumulative sum list `left` ensures that the program efficiently finds the required indices.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, considering both left-to-right and right-to-left directions. The combination of results ensures that the minimum time is reported, and the edge cases are handled appropriately.
