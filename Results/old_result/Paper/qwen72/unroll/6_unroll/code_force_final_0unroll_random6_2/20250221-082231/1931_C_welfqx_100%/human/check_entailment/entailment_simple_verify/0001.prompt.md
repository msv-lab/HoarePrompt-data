You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.

    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, and the variables `n` and `num` are updated for each test case based on the input. The variables `f`, `onum`, `cn`, `ck`, `symb1`, and `symb2` are used within the loop to perform the necessary calculations and are reset for each test case. The output for each test case is printed, which is the result of `n - max(cn, ck)`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `num`.

2. **Initial Check for All Elements Being Equal:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are already equal by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one.
   - If all elements are equal or the array has only one element, it prints `0` because no operation is needed.

3. **Finding the Longest Prefix and Suffix with the Same Element:**
   - The program then creates a copy of the array `onum` and reverses it.
   - It initializes two counters `cn` and `ck` to count the length of the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to count the length of the longest prefix of the same element starting from the beginning.
   - It iterates through the reversed array to count the length of the longest suffix of the same element starting from the end.

4. **Combining Prefix and Suffix:**
   - If the first element of the original array (`symb1`) is the same as the first element of the reversed array (`symb2`), it adds the lengths of the prefix and suffix together.
   - The program then prints the result of `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Initial Check:**
  - The initial check for all elements being equal is correct. If all elements are the same, the cost is `0` because no operation is needed.
  - If the array has only one element, the cost is also `0` because the array is already uniform.

- **Correctness of Prefix and Suffix Calculation:**
  - The program correctly calculates the length of the longest prefix and suffix where all elements are the same.
  - If the first element of the array is the same as the last element, it combines the lengths of the prefix and suffix to get the maximum possible length of a segment that can be made uniform without additional cost.

- **Correctness of Final Output:**
  - The final output `n - max(cn, ck)` is correct because it represents the minimum number of elements that need to be changed to make the entire array uniform.
  - If the first and last elements are the same, the combined length of the prefix and suffix is considered, which ensures the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by identifying the longest prefix and suffix of the same element and calculating the minimum cost to make the entire array uniform. The logic and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
