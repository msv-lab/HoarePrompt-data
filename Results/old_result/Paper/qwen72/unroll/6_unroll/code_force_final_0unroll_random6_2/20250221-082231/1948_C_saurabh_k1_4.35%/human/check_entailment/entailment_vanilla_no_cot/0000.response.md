Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is overly simplistic and only checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (i.e., `b[n - 2]`) points to the left (`<`). This is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement on the grid and check if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. Here is a more detailed approach:

1. **Initialization**: Start the robot at cell `(1, 1)`.
2. **Movement Simulation**: Simulate the robot's movement by following the rules:
   - The robot can move left, right, down, or up.
   - After each move, the robot follows the direction of the arrow in the current cell.
3. **Check for Target Cell**: If the robot reaches cell `(2, n)`, print `YES`. If the robot gets stuck or cannot reach the target cell, print `NO`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target(n, a, b):
    # Initialize the robot's position
    row, col = 1, 1
    
    # Set to keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops
    visited = set()
    
    while True:
        # If the robot is at the target cell, return True
        if row == 2 and col == n:
            return True
        
        # If the robot visits a cell it has already visited, return False
        if (row, col) in visited:
            return False
        
        # Mark the current cell as visited
        visited.add((row, col))
        
        # Determine the next move
        if row == 1:
            if a[col - 1] == '>':
                col = min(col + 1, n)
            else:
                col = max(col - 1, 1)
        else:
            if b[col - 1] == '>':
                col = min(col + 1, n)
            else:
                col = max(col - 1, 1)
        
        # Move down or up based on the current cell
        if row == 1 and b[col - 1] == '>':
            row = 2
        elif row == 2 and a[col - 1] == '<':
            row = 1

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        if can_reach_target(n, a, b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This program correctly simulates the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`. It avoids infinite loops by keeping track of visited cells and ensures that the robot follows the rules of movement.
