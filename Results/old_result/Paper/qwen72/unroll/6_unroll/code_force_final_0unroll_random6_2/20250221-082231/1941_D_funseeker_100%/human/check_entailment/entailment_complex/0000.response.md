### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_2()`, which correctly converts the input to an integer.
   - For each test case, `func_4()` is called. This function reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which correctly splits the input line and converts the parts to integers.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function `func_4()` initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, each time reading the distance `r` and direction `c` of the throw.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` by adding the possible new positions of the ball:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - After updating `ans` with `temp`, it checks if `0` is in `ans` and, if so, replaces it with `n` to handle the circular nature of the game.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball at the end of the game.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `0` is in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`.
   - The program ensures that all players are unique and sorted in the output.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of sets ensures that all elements are unique.
   - The use of modulo operations correctly handles the circular nature of the game.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly simulates the game as described and handles all edge cases appropriately. The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
