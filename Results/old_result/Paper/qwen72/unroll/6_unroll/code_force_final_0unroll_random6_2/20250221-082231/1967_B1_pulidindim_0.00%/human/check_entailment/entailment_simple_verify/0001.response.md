### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), it implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This can be simplified to \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - The program needs to count all such pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy this condition.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to \(n\).
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `count` from 2 to \(m\).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It calculates `g` as \(n / \text{count}\).
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - It updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds \(\text{g} / \text{count} + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

4. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variable `g` is calculated as \(n / \text{count}\), which does not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.
   - The update to `ans` using \(\text{g} / \text{count} + 1\) does not align with the problem's logic.
   - The program does not use the \(\gcd\) function, which is essential for solving the problem.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The initial state of the program is correct: it reads the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which is incorrect because the loop should start from 1 to include all possible values of \(b\).
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \(n\), which is not the correct starting point for counting valid pairs.
   - The loop condition `while count <= m` is correct, but the logic inside the loop is flawed.
   - The calculation of `countmins` as `count - 1` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution.
   - The calculation of `g` as \(n / \text{count}\) is incorrect and does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The condition `if g < countmins` is not relevant to the problem's logic and should be removed.
   - The update to `ans` using \(\text{g} / \text{count} + 1\) is incorrect and does not count valid pairs.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Alternatively, a more efficient approach would involve precomputing the number of valid pairs for each \(b\) and using that to quickly answer each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It lacks the necessary steps to compute the \(\gcd\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
