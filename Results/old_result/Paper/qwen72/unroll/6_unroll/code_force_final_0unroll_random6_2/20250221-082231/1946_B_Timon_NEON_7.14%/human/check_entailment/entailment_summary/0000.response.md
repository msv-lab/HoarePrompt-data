### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and need to perform `k` operations where in each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray and insert its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is a standard operation to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `arr`. However, it has some issues:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` as lists, which is not typical for finding the maximum subarray sum.
     - It appends segments to `segments_variants` and then iterates over them to find the maximum sum, which is inefficient and not necessary.
     - The function returns a list `total_max_segment` which includes the sum of the maximum positive segment, the start index, the end index, and the length of the array minus one. This is more information than needed for the problem.
     - If no positive segment is found, it returns `[-1]`, which is not the correct approach for the problem.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the main logic and always returns `0`. It does not contribute to the solution and can be ignored.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
   - It calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and prints the result after applying `func_1`.

4. **Issues**:
   - **func_2** is not correctly implemented to find the maximum subarray sum. It should use a more efficient algorithm like Kadane's algorithm.
   - The logic in the main block for calculating the final answer is flawed. The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The correct approach should be to find the maximum subarray sum and use it to maximize the array sum after `k` operations.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is positive, the optimal strategy is to repeatedly insert the maximum subarray sum `k` times.
   - If the maximum subarray sum is non-positive, the optimal strategy is to insert the sum of the entire array `k` times.
   - Calculate the final sum using the correct formula and apply the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the issues in `func_2` and the flawed logic in the main block for calculating the final answer.

**Correctness: **False****
