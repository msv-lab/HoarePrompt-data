The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `cur_arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cur_arr`. If `cur_arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, and `i` will take the value of each element in `cur_arr` during the loop iterations.

To ensure the loop executes, `cur_arr` must have at least one element. The other variables (`bit`, `new_arr`, `xor`, `thing1`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least one element, `i` is the first element in `cur_arr`**
