The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, `n` is the size of the list `a`, and the elements of `a` are integers between 1 and `n`. The function is expected to handle up to 10,000 test cases, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the typical nature of such problems, the function likely returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
