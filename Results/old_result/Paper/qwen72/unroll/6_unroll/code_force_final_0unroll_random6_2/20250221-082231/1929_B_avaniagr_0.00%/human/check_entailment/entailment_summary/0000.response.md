### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an \( n \times n \) grid so that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The grid has a total of \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, which include both the main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right and top-right to bottom-left) and the secondary diagonals.

The given program reads input from the standard input, processes each test case, and prints the result. The formula used in the program is:
\[ \text{result} = (k // 2 + k \% 2) \times (k < 4n - 3) + 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2) \]

Let's break down the formula and verify if it correctly solves the problem:

1. **Case 1: \( k < 4n - 3 \)**
   - Here, the formula simplifies to \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \).
   - \( k // 2 \) gives the integer division of \( k \) by 2.
   - \( k \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( k \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( k \) is odd and 0 if \( k \) is even.
   - Therefore, \( k // 2 + k \% 2 \) is equivalent to \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is because each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals, and if \( k \) is odd, one additional cell is needed to cover the extra diagonal.

2. **Case 2: \( k \geq 4n - 3 \)**
   - Here, the formula simplifies to \( 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) + (k == 4n - 2) \).
   - If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \), the term \( 2n \times (k \geq 4n - 3) \) evaluates to \( 2n \).
   - If \( k == 4n - 2 \), the term \( (k == 4n - 2) \) evaluates to 1, otherwise it evaluates to 0.
   - Therefore, the formula becomes \( 2n + (k == 4n - 2) \).
   - If \( k == 4n - 2 \), the result is \( 2n + 1 \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
   - If \( k == 4n - 3 \), the result is \( 2n \), which is the minimum number of cells needed to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \) by adding 1 to the result.
   - The program also handles the case where \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \) by using the ceiling function of \( k / 2 \).

Given the problem constraints and the formula, the program appears to correctly handle all cases and produce the minimum number of cells needed to be colored.
