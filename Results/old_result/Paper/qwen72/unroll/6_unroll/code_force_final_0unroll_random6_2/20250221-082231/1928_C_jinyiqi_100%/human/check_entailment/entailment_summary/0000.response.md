### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints of Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It uses the function `func_1` to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It then checks if each divisor \( s \) plus 2 is even and if the resulting \( k \) (which is \( (s + 2) / 2 \)) is greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - It collects all valid \( k \) values and prints the count of unique valid \( k \) values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(x)` finds all divisors of \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by the current number \( i \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( i \), it appends both \( i \) and \( x / i \) to the output lists.
   - It reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors to form the final list of divisors.

4. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - The main logic checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - If they are even, it finds their divisors using `func_1`.
   - It then checks if each divisor \( s \) plus 2 is even and if the resulting \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - It collects all valid \( k \) values and ensures they are unique by converting the list to a set.
   - Finally, it prints the count of unique valid \( k \) values.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly filters the divisors to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The logic for checking if \( k \) is valid (i.e., \( k \geq x \) and \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1) is implemented correctly.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.
