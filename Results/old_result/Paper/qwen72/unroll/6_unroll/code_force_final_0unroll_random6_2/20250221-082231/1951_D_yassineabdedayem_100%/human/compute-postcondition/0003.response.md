The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, we can only infer that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The exact nature of the result depends on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). It returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` being an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**
