Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the list `a` are in reverse order.

### Understanding the List `a`:
- The list `a` starts with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
- However, the elements at even indices are reversed. This means:
  - The element at index 0 will be `n`.
  - The element at index 2 will be `n-2`.
  - The element at index 4 will be `n-4`.
  - And so on, until the last even index.

### Example:
- If `n = 5`, the list `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- After reversing the elements at even indices, the list `a` becomes `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.
  - Index 0: `5` (reversed from `1`)
  - Index 2: `3` (unchanged)
  - Index 4: `1` (reversed from `5`)

### General Case:
- For a general `n`, the list `a` will have the following structure:
  - The element at index 0 will be `n`.
  - The element at index 2 will be `n-2`.
  - The element at index 4 will be `n-4`.
  - And so on, until the last even index.
- The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) will remain in their original positions.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(a)
```

### Output:
The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` where the elements at even indices are in reverse order, and the elements at odd indices remain in their original positions.

Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1] (where n is the value of `n` and the list is structured such that elements at even indices are in reverse order while elements at odd indices remain in their original positions)**
