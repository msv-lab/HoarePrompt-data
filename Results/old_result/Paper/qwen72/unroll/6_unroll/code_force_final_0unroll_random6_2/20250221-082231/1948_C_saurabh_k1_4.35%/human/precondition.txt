t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of columns in the grid. The grid consists of 2 rows, and each row is represented by a string of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', indicating arrows pointing left or right, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
