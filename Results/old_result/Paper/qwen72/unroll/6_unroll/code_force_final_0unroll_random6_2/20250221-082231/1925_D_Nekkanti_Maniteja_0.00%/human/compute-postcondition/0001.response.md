Output State: **For each test case, the final value of `s` is calculated and printed as `s % M`, where `M` is \(10^9 + 7\). The value of `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the loop iterates `t` times.**

To break it down:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from input.
  - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\).
  - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
  - `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` input lines.
  - `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
  - The final value of `s` is printed as `s % M`.

Thus, the output state for each test case is the value of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
