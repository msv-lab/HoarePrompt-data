You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x - 1
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x - 1
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The loop prints the value of x - 1 for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest positive integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The given program always sets \( y \) to \( x - 1 \).
   - Let's consider the gcd of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \):
     - If \( x \) is any integer, \( x - 1 \) is the integer immediately less than \( x \).
     - The gcd of \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) is always 1 because \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and consecutive integers are coprime (their gcd is 1).

3. **Evaluating the Expression:**
   - The expression to maximize is \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).
   - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x \).

4. **Checking for Other Possible Values:**
   - For any other \( y \) where \( 1 \le y < x \), the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) will be less than or equal to \( x \).
   - This is because \( \gcd(x, y) \le x \) and \( y \le x-1 \), so \( \gcd(x, y) + y \le x \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program always outputs \( y = x - 1 \), which is a valid and optimal solution because it maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) to \( x \).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it always finds a valid \( y \) that maximizes the expression \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.
