You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string `s` as input, where `2 <= len(s) <= 2 * 10^5` and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `n` times, and for each execution, it will read a new binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, count the number of zeroes in `s`, and then compute and print the value of `ans` which represents the sum of the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1' in the string `s`. After `n` iterations, the loop will terminate, and the final state will be that `n` will be 0, and the values of `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be undefined or reset for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It processes each test case and returns the result based on the binary string `s`.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
