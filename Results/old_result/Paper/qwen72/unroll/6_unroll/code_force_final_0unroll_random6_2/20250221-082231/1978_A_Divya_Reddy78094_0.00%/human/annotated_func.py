#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_pages(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        nums.sort(reverse=True)
        
        print(nums[0] + nums[1])
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing, and the variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is also unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the user is prompted to input `n` and a list of `n` integers, which are then sorted in descending order, and the sum of the two largest integers is printed. The variables `n` and `nums` are updated in each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the user, sorts the list in descending order, and prints the sum of the two largest integers. The function does not modify any external variables or return any values. After the function concludes, the user will have seen the sum of the two largest integers for each test case.
