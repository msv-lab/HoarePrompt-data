Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can cut an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two rectangles and then form a different rectangle (not just a rotated version of the original) from the two resulting rectangles. The key insight is that for Bob to be able to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \(a\) or \(b\) must be even. This is because if \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of equal size, and then rearrange these smaller rectangles to form a new rectangle with a different aspect ratio.

Let's analyze the function `func_1(a, b)`:

1. **Function Logic**:
   - The function checks if `b` is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If `b` is even, it returns 'yes'.
   - If `b` is odd, it returns 'no'.
   - The value of `a` is not used in the function.

2. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle. The function should also check if `a` is even.
   - For example, if \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, Bob can still form a different rectangle by cutting along the dimension \(a\).

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input \(2 \times 6\), the function correctly returns 'yes' because \(b\) is even.
   - For the input \(3 \times 2\), the function correctly returns 'yes' because \(b\) is even.
   - For the input \(2 \times 1\), the function correctly returns 'no' because \(b\) is odd.
   - However, for the input \(4 \times 3\), the function incorrectly returns 'no' because it only checks \(b\) and not \(a\). In this case, \(a\) is even, so Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and form a \(3 \times 4\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

Therefore, the function `func_1(a, b)` is incorrect because it does not consider the case where `a` is even and `b` is odd.

Correctness: **False**
