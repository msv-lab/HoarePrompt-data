The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `a` and `b` from the input, performs a series of calculations to compute a value `suma`, and prints `suma - 2`. The values of `n` and `m` (mentioned in the preconditions) are not modified by the function. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of `suma` is 0 for each test case.
