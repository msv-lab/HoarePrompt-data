Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where `n` is significantly larger than `k` and where the optimal solution involves more than 2 stalls. For example, consider the case where `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The program will output:

```
YES
2
8 1
```

However, this is incorrect because with the prices `8` and `1`, Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 8 coins) and then 2 jewels from the second stall (spending 2 coins), totaling 3 jewels, but she will have 0 coins left, which is not necessary according to the problem description. A correct solution for this case could be:

```
YES
3
3 3 3
```

In this solution, Alice buys 1 jewel from each of the three stalls, spending 3 coins each time, and ends up with exactly 3 jewels and 1 coin left. This case demonstrates that the program does not always provide a valid solution for every input.
