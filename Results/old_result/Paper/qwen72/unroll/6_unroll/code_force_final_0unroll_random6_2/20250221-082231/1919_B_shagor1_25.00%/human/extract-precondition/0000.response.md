Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string s (s_i ∈ {'+', '-'} and |s| = n) representing the length and content of the string for each test case. However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```python
def min_penalty(t, test_cases):
```

**Where t is the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n and a string s.**
