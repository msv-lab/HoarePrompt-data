It seems there was a misunderstanding in the function definition provided. Given the problem description, the function should accept parameters for the number of test cases, the number of monsters, the number of bullets you can fire per second, the health of each monster, and the positions of each monster. Here is a more appropriate function definition:

```python
def can_survive(t, cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # cases is a list of tuples, each containing (n, k, a, x)
    # where n is the number of monsters, k is the number of bullets you can fire per second,
    # a is a list of integers representing the health of each monster,
    # x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of each monster.
    pass
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (n, k, a, x) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k being an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a being a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x being a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
