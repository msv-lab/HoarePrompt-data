The function `func` does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it is designed to process multiple test cases provided through a structured input format, such as standard input or a predefined input method. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element is either 0 or 1, indicating whether a cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each test case contains a chip.

The function returns the result for each test case, which is not explicitly specified in the given information. However, based on the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function might return some form of output related to the arrangement or movement of chips in the ribbon.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `a` of length `n` with elements 0 or 1, representing a ribbon with cells that are either free or contain a chip. The function returns a result for each test case, which is not explicitly defined but likely relates to the arrangement or movement of chips in the ribbon.**
