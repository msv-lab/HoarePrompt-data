The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `_` is 0**
