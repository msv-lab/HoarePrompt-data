To ensure the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to check the conditions in the loop head: `not vis[s]` and `k > 0`.

1. **`vis[s]`**: This condition checks if the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha (stored in `s`) have not been visited yet. Since `vis` is initially a list of `n` zeros, `vis[s]` will be `0` (or `False`), which means `not vis[s]` will be `True`.

2. **`k > 0`**: This condition checks if `k` is greater than 0. The state right before the loop indicates that `k` is a positive integer, so this condition is already satisfied.

Given that both conditions are already met, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of `p`, `mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `vis` is a list of `n` zeros**
