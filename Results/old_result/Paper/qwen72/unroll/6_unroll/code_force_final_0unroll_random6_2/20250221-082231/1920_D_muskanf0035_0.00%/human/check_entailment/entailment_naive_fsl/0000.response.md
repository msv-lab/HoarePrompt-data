Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the second type of operation correctly. Specifically, the second type of operation should append `x` copies of the current array to itself, but the program only appends one copy. This leads to incorrect results for queries that depend on the repeated structure of the array.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 2
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

Expected output:
```
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 1
```

Actual output from the program:
```
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
```

The program fails to correctly handle the operation where `x` copies of the array are appended, leading to incorrect results for the queries.
