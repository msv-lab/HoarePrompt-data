### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing operations that replace a subarray with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - The operations can be performed no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray to replace to maximize the sum.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray from `i` to `j` is replaced with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a subarray from `i` to `j` is approximated by \((j - i + 1)^2\), which is a heuristic to maximize the sum.
   - The function returns the indices `r` and `l` of the subarray that maximizes the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**:
   - This function recursively adds operations to the list `ops` to ensure the subarray from `r` to `l` is replaced with the MEX.
   - If `r` equals `l`, it appends a single operation to `ops`.
   - Otherwise, it recursively adds operations to replace the subarray from `r` to `l-1` and then from `r` to `l`.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function performs the actual replacement of the subarray from `r` to `l` with the MEX.
   - It appends the operation to `ops` and checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If so, it appends another operation to replace the subarray again.
   - It then appends an operation to replace the subarray from `r` to `r` (a single element).
   - It recursively calls `func_2` to ensure the entire subarray is replaced.
   - Finally, it replaces the subarray in `lst` with the MEX value and returns the updated list.

5. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a heuristic to find the optimal subarray to replace, which is a reasonable approach given the constraints.
   - The recursive functions `func_2` and `func_3` ensure that the subarray is replaced with the MEX value and the operations are recorded.
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the MEX but uses a heuristic to approximate it, which is a creative approach but may not always yield the correct MEX value.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The heuristic used in `func_1` to approximate the MEX value \((j - i + 1)^2\) is not accurate. The MEX of a subarray is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` might lead to an excessive number of operations, potentially exceeding the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
The program's heuristic for approximating the MEX value is incorrect and may lead to suboptimal results. Additionally, the recursive approach might generate too many operations, violating the problem constraints.

**Correctness: False**
