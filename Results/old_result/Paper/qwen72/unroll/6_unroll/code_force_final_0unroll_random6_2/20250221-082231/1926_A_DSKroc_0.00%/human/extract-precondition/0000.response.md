Precondition: **The function does not take any explicit input parameters. However, it is expected to read from standard input a series of test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.**
