The function `func_1` accepts a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. The binary string `s` has a length between 2 and 200,000, and each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer between 1 and 10,000. The sum of the lengths of all strings across all test cases does not exceed 200,000.

The function returns the result of processing each test case based on the binary string `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It processes each test case and returns the result based on the binary string `s`.**
