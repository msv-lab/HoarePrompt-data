Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
No
No
Yes
```

The program fails in the first test case. The array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` which is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program does not perform the transformation correctly and prints `No`.

The issue lies in the logic of the loop where the program attempts to split the elements. It only checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than 10. It then splits the previous element, but it does not check if the array is sorted after the transformation. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.
