The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `l`. It then processes the list to count the number of elements that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements in the list. The function prints this count for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged after the function concludes, while the internal variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are reset and updated for each test case.
