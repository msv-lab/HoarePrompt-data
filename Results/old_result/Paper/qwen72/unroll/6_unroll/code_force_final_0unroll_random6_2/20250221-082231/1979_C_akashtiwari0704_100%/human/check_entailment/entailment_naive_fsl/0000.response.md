Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. According to the problem description, if all multipliers are the same, it is impossible to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the program does not correctly identify this case and outputs a solution that does not meet the requirements.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

The program will output:
```
1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the total amount of coins bet is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \), and the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \). Since the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back, the program's output is incorrect for this case. Therefore, the program is not correct.
