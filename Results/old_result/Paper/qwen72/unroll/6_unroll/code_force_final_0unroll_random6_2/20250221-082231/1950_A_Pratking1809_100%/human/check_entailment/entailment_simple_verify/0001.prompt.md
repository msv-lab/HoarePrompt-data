You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `q` times, and for each iteration, it will have read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will have printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final state after the last iteration, but their specific values will depend on the last input provided. The variable `i` will have the value `q-1` after the loop finishes. The number of test cases `t` and the input integer `q` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `q`, which is an integer. This is done using `q = int(input())`. This is correct as per the problem description, which states that the first line contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, where `q` is the number of test cases. This is implemented using `for i in range(q):`. This is correct because it ensures that the program processes each test case exactly once.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is done using `(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())`. This is correct because it converts the input string into three integers, which is consistent with the problem description that each test case contains three digits separated by spaces.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. If this condition is true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. If this condition is true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints 'NONE'.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions checked. This matches the expected output format as described in the problem.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`) or when the digits do not form a stair or a peak (e.g., `4 1 7`). In these cases, it correctly prints 'NONE'.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required by the problem description and handles all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
