Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has some logical errors in determining the winner of the game. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Case `a == b`:**
   - If Alice and Bob have the same number of coins, the program correctly outputs "Bob" because the game will end in a draw where Bob makes the last move. This is correct.

2. **Case `a == 1`:**
   - If Alice has 1 coin and Bob has more than 1 coin, Alice will lose because she can only remove her last coin and then Bob will win. The program correctly outputs "Alice" in this case, but this is incorrect. Alice should lose if Bob has more than 1 coin.

3. **Case `b == 1`:**
   - If Bob has 1 coin and Alice has more than 1 coin, Bob will lose because Alice can swap wallets and then remove Bob's last coin. The program correctly outputs "Bob" in this case, but this is incorrect. Bob should lose if Alice has more than 1 coin.

4. **Case `a % 2 == 1`:**
   - If Alice has an odd number of coins, the program outputs "Bob". This is incorrect. If Alice has an odd number of coins and Bob has an even number of coins, Alice can always win by swapping and then removing a coin, ensuring Bob is left with an odd number of coins.

5. **Case `a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1`:**
   - If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, the program outputs "Alice". This is correct.

6. **Case `a > b`:**
   - If Alice has more coins than Bob, the program outputs "Bob". This is incorrect. Alice can always win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin, ensuring Bob is left with fewer coins.

7. **Case `a < b`:**
   - If Alice has fewer coins than Bob, the program outputs "Alice". This is incorrect. Bob can always win by swapping wallets and then removing a coin, ensuring Alice is left with fewer coins.

### Correct Solution:
To determine the winner, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins each player has and the relative number of coins. Here’s the correct logic:

- If both players have the same number of coins, Bob wins.
- If Alice has 1 coin and Bob has more than 1 coin, Bob wins.
- If Bob has 1 coin and Alice has more than 1 coin, Alice wins.
- If Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice wins.
- If Alice has an odd number of coins and Bob has an even number of coins, Bob wins.
- If Alice has more coins than Bob, Alice wins.
- If Bob has more coins than Alice, Bob wins.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif a == 1 and b > 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1 and a > 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        elif a > b:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
