### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Counting and Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of sorting the string.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans`.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm aims to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order.
  - The key idea is to count the number of `1`s before each `0` and the number of `0`s after each `1` to determine the cost of cyclic shifts.
  - The program correctly counts the number of `1`s before each `0` and the number of `0`s after each `1` to compute the total cost.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., `0000`) by outputting `0`.
  - It also handles the case where the string contains only one type of character (e.g., `1111` or `0000`).

- **Optimality**:
  - The algorithm is optimal because it only counts the necessary shifts and does not perform any unnecessary operations.

- **Input Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem description, including the number of test cases and the length of the strings.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
