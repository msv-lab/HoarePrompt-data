The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer input provided. The function `func` and its expected behavior regarding handling multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`, remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `t` and retains the information about the function `func`.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20). The function should return a list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, or -1 if no such distribution is possible. `t` is an input integer.**
