Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes and could be in a position that is not removed. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the favorite cube will always be removed if it is within the first `k` positions after sorting, without considering the possibility that other cubes with the same value might be removed instead.

Example Case:
```
Input:
1
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3

Output:
YES
```

Expected Output:
```
MAYBE
```

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) shows the value 3. After sorting, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, where the favorite cube could be in the second, third, or fourth position. If the favorite cube is in the second position, it will be removed. If it is in the third or fourth position, it will not be removed. Therefore, the correct output should be "MAYBE," but the program outputs "YES."
