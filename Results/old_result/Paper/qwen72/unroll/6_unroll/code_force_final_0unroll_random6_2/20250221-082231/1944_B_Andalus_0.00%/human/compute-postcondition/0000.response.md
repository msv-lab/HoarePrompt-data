Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by a pair of integers `n` and `k`, and the list `a`. `T` is an input integer.**
