Precondition: **x is an integer such that 1 \le x \le 10^9.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `x`, as described in the problem. Here is the corrected function definition:

```
def func_1(n, x):
```

Precondition: **n and x are integers such that 1 \le x < n \le 10^9.**
