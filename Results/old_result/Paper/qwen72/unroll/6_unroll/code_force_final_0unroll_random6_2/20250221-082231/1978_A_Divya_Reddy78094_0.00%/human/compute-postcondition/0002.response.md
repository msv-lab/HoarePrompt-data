Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is also unchanged. For each iteration of the loop, the user is prompted to input `n` and a list of `n` integers, which are then sorted in descending order, and the sum of the two largest integers is printed. The variables `n` and `nums` are updated in each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.**
