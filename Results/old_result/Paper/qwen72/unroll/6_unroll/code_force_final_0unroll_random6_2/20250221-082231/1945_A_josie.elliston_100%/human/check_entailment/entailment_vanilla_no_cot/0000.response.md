Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly addresses the problem of determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the participants based on their preferences. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` indicating that it's impossible to fulfill the extroverts' preferences.
   - It then returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed for them.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function combines the results from `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` with the number of extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents needed.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and when there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. It also correctly returns -1 when it's impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.

Thus, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
