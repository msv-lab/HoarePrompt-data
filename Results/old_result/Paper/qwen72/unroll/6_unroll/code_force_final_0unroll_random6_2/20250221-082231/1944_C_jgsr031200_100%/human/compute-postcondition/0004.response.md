The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, meaning `n` must be at least 0. Before the loop starts, `freq` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `arr`, and `cou` is 0. However, these details are not directly related to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be non-negative, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`freq` is a list of length `n + 1`, `cou` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 0**
