Output State: **The list `a` is now a list containing only the unique elements from the original list `a`, sorted in reverse order of their first appearance. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the original list `a`. `cnt` is equal to `n - len(a)`.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` remains a list containing only the unique elements from the original list `a`, sorted in reverse order of their first appearance.
- The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` are unchanged.
- The `counter` object still contains the frequency of each element in the original list `a`.
- `cnt` is assigned the value of `n - len(a)`, where `len(a)` is the length of the list `a` after removing duplicates and sorting in reverse order of their first appearance.
