Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, reads the inputs for each case, and calculates the maximum score by determining how many new cards can be bought to form the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The program uses a sorting approach to efficiently manage the distribution of cards and the use of coins to buy additional cards, and it correctly updates the score based on the number of cards and the remaining coins. The logic for calculating the score and handling the remaining coins is consistent with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
