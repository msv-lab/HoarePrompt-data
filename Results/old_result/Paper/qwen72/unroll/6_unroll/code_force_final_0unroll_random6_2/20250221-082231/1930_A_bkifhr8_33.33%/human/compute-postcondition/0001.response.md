Output State: **`t` is now an input integer, `ans_f` is an empty list.**

The function takes an integer `t` as an input, representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each inner list contains 2n integers. The variable `ans_f` is initialized as an empty list. The initial state of `t` being an input integer and `ans_f` being an empty list remains unchanged.
