The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and the list `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple. The first tuple in `test_cases` will be unpacked into `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` at the start of the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one tuple, and the first tuple should be unpacked into `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
