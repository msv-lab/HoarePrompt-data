The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 2, because the loop runs from 0 to `n - 3` (inclusive), which means there must be at least 3 iterations for the loop to run once. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 1 <= i < len(arr), `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized with zeros, and `ans[0]` is equal to `arr[0] + 1, `i` is 0**
