Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, q is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, and each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of n and q across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
