Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available for buying new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type initially available. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
