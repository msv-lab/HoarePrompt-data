### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is correct since it reads input from the user.
   - It reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculating the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2`, which is the total number of 2x2 icons.
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is then calculated. Each screen can hold 5 rows, and each 2x2 icon occupies 2 rows, so the total number of screens needed is `t // 5` if `t` is divisible by 5, otherwise `t // 5 + 1`.

3. **Calculating the Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the total number of cells available on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` (the remaining cells) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons), then the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the function calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons. This is done by calculating `t2 = a - t1` (the number of 1x1 icons that still need space) and then determining the additional screens required. If `t2` is divisible by 15, the additional screens are `t2 // 15`, otherwise `t2 // 15 + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons is `b * 2 // 5` (or `b * 2 // 5 + 1` if there is a remainder).
- The logic for calculating the remaining space for 1x1 icons is also correct. The total number of cells available on `t` screens is `t * 15`, and the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons is `b * 4`. Therefore, the remaining cells are `t * 15 - b * 4`.
- The logic for adding additional screens for 1x1 icons is correct. If the remaining space is insufficient, the function correctly calculates the additional screens needed.

### Potential Issues:

- **Variable Naming**: The variable names `t`, `t1`, and `t2` are not very descriptive, which can make the code harder to understand. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Grid Size Assumption**: The program assumes that each screen has 15 cells (5 rows and 3 columns), which is correct based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of screens required to display all the icons based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
