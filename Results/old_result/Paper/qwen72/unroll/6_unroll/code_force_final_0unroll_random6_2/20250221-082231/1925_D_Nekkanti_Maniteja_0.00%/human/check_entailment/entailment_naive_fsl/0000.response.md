Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum `s` is incorrect. The program incorrectly multiplies `c` (the inverse of the total number of pairs) by `i` and then by `m` and `a` in each iteration of the loop, which does not reflect the correct expected value calculation.

A correct approach would involve calculating the expected value for each excursion and then summing these expected values. The expected value for a single excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs, plus the number of pairs, divided by the total number of possible pairs. This expected value should be accumulated over all k excursions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        initial_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            initial_sum = (initial_sum + f) % M
        
        expected_value = (initial_sum + m) * k * c % M
        print(expected_value)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value for each excursion and sums these values over all k excursions. The original program fails to do this, leading to incorrect results. For example, with the input:
```
2
2 1 10
1 2 1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
The original program would produce incorrect results, while the corrected version would produce the correct expected values.
