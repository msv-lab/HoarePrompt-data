### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read lines from the input, which is efficient and appropriate for large inputs.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line and strips the newline character, `func_2` converts the line to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into a list of integers. This is consistent with the problem's input format.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop, which is correct.

3. **Initial Setup:**
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct as the ball starts with player `x`.

4. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over the `m` throws.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set.
   - The use of `% n` ensures that the positions wrap around the circle correctly. However, it is important to note that the positions are 1-indexed, and the modulo operation should account for this.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, as player `0` is the same as player `n` in a 1-indexed circle.
   - It then prints the number of players in the set and the sorted list of player numbers.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **1-indexed vs 0-indexed:**
  - The problem specifies that players are numbered from 1 to n. However, the modulo operation in the program is 0-indexed. This means that the positions are calculated as 0 to n-1, and the final adjustment to convert 0 to n is necessary.
  - The adjustment `if 0 in ans: ans.discard(0); ans.add(n)` correctly handles the 1-indexed nature of the problem.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The use of a set `ans` to keep track of possible positions is appropriate because it ensures that all positions are unique.
  - The operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` correctly calculate the new positions in a circular manner.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `c` is '?', considering both possible directions.
  - The program also correctly handles the case where `c` is '0' or '1', updating the positions accordingly.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly handles the 1-indexed nature of the problem, processes each throw, and updates the set of possible positions. The final adjustments and output format match the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: **True**
