Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, representing the number of time entries to process. For each of the `n` entries, it reads a time in the "hh:mm" format, converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM, and prints the converted time. The function does not modify the values of `t` or `s` (which are mentioned in the preconditions but not used in the function), and the final state of the `day` variable will be 'PM' if the loop runs at least once and the hour `h` is not 12, otherwise it will be 'AM'. The function does not return any value. **
