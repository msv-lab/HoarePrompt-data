The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`). The variable `i` will start at 1 for the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= n and `p_i` ≠ i, and all `p_i` are distinct
- `v` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers input by the user

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, and `i` must start at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `v` is a list of n + 1 integers where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the integers input by the user, `i` is 1**
