Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought (k) is less than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day (m). In such a case, the program should simply buy all the tickets on the cheapest day, but it does not handle this edge case correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
The expected output should be `1` because you can buy 1 ticket on the second day, which is the cheapest. However, the program will output `10001` because it incorrectly calculates the cost by considering the increase in price for subsequent days, even though only one ticket is needed.

This shows that the program does not handle the case where `k < m` correctly, leading to incorrect results.
