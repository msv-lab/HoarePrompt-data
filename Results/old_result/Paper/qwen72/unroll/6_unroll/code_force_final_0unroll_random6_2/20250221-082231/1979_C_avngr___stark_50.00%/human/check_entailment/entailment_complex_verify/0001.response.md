### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that the total sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \) is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome \( k_i \cdot x_i \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers \( m = \prod_{i=1}^{n} k_i \).
   - It then calculates the bets \( c_i \) as \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \).
   - The highest common factor (HCF) of the bets \( c \) is computed using the `func_1` function.
   - Each bet \( c_i \) is then divided by the HCF to ensure the bets are as small as possible.
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) is strictly less than \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \). If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product \( m \) is correctly calculated as the product of all multipliers \( k_i \).
   - **Bets Calculation:** The bets \( c_i \) are calculated as \( c_i = \frac{m}{k_i} \), which ensures that the return for each outcome \( k_i \cdot c_i \) is equal to \( m \).
   - **HCF Calculation:** The HCF of the bets \( c \) is correctly computed using the `func_1` function, which iterates through the list and uses the `gcd` function.
   - **Bets Normalization:** Each bet \( c_i \) is divided by the HCF to reduce the bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the proportionality.
   - **Condition Check:** The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \) is used to check if the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. This condition is necessary and sufficient for the bets to be valid.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Multipliers the Same:** If all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same, the HCF will be \( k_i \) itself. The sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) will be \( n \), and \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} = k_i^{n-1} \). For \( n \geq 2 \), \( n \) is not less than \( k_i^{n-1} \), so the program correctly prints \(-1\).
   - **Different Multipliers:** If the multipliers are different, the program correctly calculates the bets and checks the condition. The HCF will be a smaller value, and the sum of bets \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i \) will be compared to \( \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \).

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to compute the HCF, which is efficient.
   - The product \( m \) can be large, but the program handles it by dividing by the HCF, ensuring the bets are within the required constraints.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
  - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \).
  - Each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a list of integers \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n \).
  - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly computes the HCF of the list of integers.
  - The HCF is the greatest common divisor of all integers in the list \( c \).
  - The function does not modify the input list or any external variables.

- **Final Check:**
  - The condition \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i < \frac{m}{\text{HCF}} \) is correctly implemented.
  - If the condition is satisfied, the bets are printed. Otherwise, \(-1\) is printed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if the condition is satisfied. It handles edge cases and ensures the bets are within the required constraints.
