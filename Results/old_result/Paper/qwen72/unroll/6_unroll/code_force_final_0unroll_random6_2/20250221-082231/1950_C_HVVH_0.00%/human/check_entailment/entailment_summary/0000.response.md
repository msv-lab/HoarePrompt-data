Reasoning:  
The function `func` is intended to convert times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including the correct AM/PM designation. However, there are a few issues in the logic:

1. **AM/PM Assignment Logic**: The logic for determining whether the time is AM or PM is flawed. Specifically:
   - If `h == 0`, it correctly converts to 12:00 AM.
   - If `h > 12`, it correctly converts to PM and subtracts 12 from the hour.
   - However, if `h == 12`, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' instead of 'AM'. This is a mistake because 12:00 in the 24-hour format should be 12:00 PM, not 12:00 AM.
   - If `h <= 11`, it incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' instead of 'AM'. This is a mistake because times from 01:00 to 11:59 in the 24-hour format should be AM, not PM.

2. **Output Format**: The function correctly formats the output as "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" with leading zeros for hours and minutes.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases in the example should be handled correctly, but the current logic fails for some of them, particularly those where the hour is 12 or less than 12.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
