Output State: **The list `a` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`, `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`, `val` is set to the first element of `arr`, `cnt` is set to 0.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `arr` remains the same list of integers.
- `flag` is `False` if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different, otherwise `flag` remains `True`.
- `ans` is set to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
- `val` is assigned the value of the first element of `arr` (i.e., `arr[0]`).
- `cnt` is assigned the value 0.
