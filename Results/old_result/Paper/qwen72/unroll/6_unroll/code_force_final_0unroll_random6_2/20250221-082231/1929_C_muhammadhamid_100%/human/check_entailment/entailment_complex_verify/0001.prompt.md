You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 1
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, k, x, and a are integers such that 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 1
        
        for i in range(x):
            s += s // (k - 1) + 1
        
        print('Yes' if a >= s else 'No')
        
    #State: For each test case, the value of `s` is calculated based on the given `k`, `x`, and `a`. The loop iterates `x` times, updating `s` in each iteration. After all iterations, the loop prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, but `s` is reset to 1 for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `k`, `x`, and `a` where `2 <= k <= 30`, `1 <= x <= 100`, and `1 <= a <= 10^9`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` by iterating `x` times and updating `s` in each iteration. After the iterations, it prints 'Yes' if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise it prints 'No'. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, but `s` is reset to 1 for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins.
   - If he wins a bet of `y` coins, he gains `y * (k - 1)` coins.
   - If he loses a bet, he loses `y` coins.
   - He cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee having at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins, he must be able to recover from any sequence of losses.
   - The maximum number of consecutive losses is `x`, so after `x` losses, he must have enough coins to place another bet and potentially win.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - If Sasha can place a bet of `1` coin and win, he will have `k` coins.
   - If he loses, he will have `a - 1` coins.
   - After `x` losses, he will have `a - x` coins.
   - To ensure he can always place another bet, he must have at least `1` coin left after `x` losses, which means `a - x >= 1` or `a >= x + 1`.

4. **Mathematical Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to guarantee that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses.
   - The formula used in the program is `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for each of the `x` losses.
   - This formula is derived from the idea that after each loss, Sasha needs to have enough coins to place a bet that can recover the loss and still have a positive number of coins left.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program initializes `s` to `1`.
   - It then iterates `x` times, each time adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`.
   - This calculation is intended to determine the minimum number of coins `s` needed to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses.
   - Finally, it checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.

6. **Verification:**
   - For the first test case: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`.
     - `s` starts at `1`.
     - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - Sasha needs at least `3` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 1 loss.
     - Since `a = 7` is greater than `3`, the answer is `YES`.
   - For the second test case: `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`.
     - `s` starts at `1`.
     - After 1 loss: `s += 1 // (2 - 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - Sasha needs at least `3` coins to guarantee he can always place another bet after 1 loss.
     - Since `a = 1` is less than `3`, the answer is `NO`.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` is just enough to cover the losses and still place another bet.
   - It also handles the case where `a` is much larger than `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to ensure that Sasha can always place another bet after `x` losses. It then checks if the initial number of coins `a` is sufficient to meet this requirement. The logic and the formula used are appropriate for the problem.
