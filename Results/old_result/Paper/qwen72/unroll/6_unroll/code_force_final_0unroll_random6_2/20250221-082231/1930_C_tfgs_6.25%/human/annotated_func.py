#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case with the first element being an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5) and the second element being a list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: For each test case, the list `a` will have its elements modified such that each element `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: The list `a` remains a list containing only the unique elements from the original list `a`, sorted in reverse order of their first appearance. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, but all frequencies have been reduced to zero. `cnt` is zero. `ans` is a list that contains all the elements from the original list `a`, but with additional elements inserted between the elements of `a` to ensure that each element in `ans` is unique and the total length of `ans` is equal to `n`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The list `a` remains a list containing only the unique elements from the original list `a`, sorted in reverse order of their first appearance. The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the original list `a`, but all frequencies have been reduced to zero. `cnt` is zero. `ans` is a list that contains all the elements from the original list `a`, but with additional elements inserted between the elements of `a` to ensure that each element in `ans` is unique and the total length of `ans` is equal to `n`. Since `cnt` is zero, the loop does not execute, and `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] (where ans is a list containing all the unique elements from the original list a, and additional elements to ensure the total length is n)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element `a[i]` by `i + 1`. It then ensures that the modified list `a` contains unique elements by inserting additional elements as necessary, while maintaining the total length of the list as `n`. The final list `ans` is printed, containing all unique elements from the modified list `a` and any additional elements needed to ensure the list length is `n`. The function does not return any value.
