Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd. Specifically, the logic for handling the odd case is incorrect. The program prints the number of pairs of yogurts and then calculates the cost, which is not the correct approach. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 5 9
```
The correct output should be `14` because Maxim can buy two yogurts for `9` burles and one yogurt for `5` burles, totaling `14` burles. However, the program will print:
```
1
14
```
This is incorrect because it prints an extra line with the number of pairs of yogurts, which is not part of the expected output.

The correct approach should be to calculate the cost for the pairs of yogurts and then add the cost for the remaining yogurt if `A` is odd. Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            pairs = A // 2
            remaining = A % 2
            print(pairs * C + remaining * B)
```
This version correctly handles both even and odd values of `A` and produces the expected output for all test cases.
