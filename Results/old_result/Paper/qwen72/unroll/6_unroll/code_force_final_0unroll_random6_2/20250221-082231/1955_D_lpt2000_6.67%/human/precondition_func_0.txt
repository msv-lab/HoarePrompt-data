The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def count_good_subsegments(t, n, m, k, a, b):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `m` are the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` respectively (1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` is the required number of matching elements, `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and `b` is a list of `m` integers (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
