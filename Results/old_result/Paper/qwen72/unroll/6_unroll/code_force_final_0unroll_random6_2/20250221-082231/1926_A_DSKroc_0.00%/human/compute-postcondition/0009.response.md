The function `func` does not accept any explicit parameters. It reads from standard input a series of test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following `t` lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all `t` strings are distinct. The function processes these inputs and returns the result based on the provided test cases.
