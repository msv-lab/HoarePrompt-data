### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1()` creates a list `a` that contains the integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) of the list `a` using the slicing operation `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - Finally, it prints the modified list `a`.

3. **Permutation Validity:**
   - The goal is to ensure that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the elements at even indices are in descending order while the elements at odd indices remain in ascending order.
   - This approach helps to break the divisibility pattern that could occur if the elements were in a simple ascending or descending order.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 4`, the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, `a` becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
   - This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`.
     - `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the list `a` initially is `[1, 2, 3]`.
   - After reversing the elements at even indices, `a` becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
   - This permutation is valid because:
     - `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program ensures that the elements at even indices are in descending order, which helps to avoid the divisibility condition between `p_i` and `p_j` for even `i` and `j`.
   - The elements at odd indices remain in ascending order, which also helps to avoid the divisibility condition between `p_{i+1}` and `p_{j+1}` for odd `i` and `j`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
