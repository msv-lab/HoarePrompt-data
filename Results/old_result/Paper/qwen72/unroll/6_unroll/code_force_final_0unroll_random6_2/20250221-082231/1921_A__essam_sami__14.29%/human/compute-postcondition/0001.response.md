The only objects in the loop head are the variables `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, and `t` is a specific integer value provided by the user. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `steps` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is a specific integer value provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `steps` is 0**
