Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners, with the sides parallel to the coordinate axes. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Calculation of Square Area**: The area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. The program calculates `n` and `x` as the squared distances between two pairs of points. However, it does not ensure that these points are diagonally opposite corners of the square. The correct approach would be to find the side length of the square by calculating the distance between two adjacent corners and then squaring this distance.

2. **Diagonal vs. Side**: The program assumes that the points used to calculate `n` and `x` are diagonally opposite corners of the square. This is not necessarily true, as the points are given in random order. The correct approach would be to identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two points that are either horizontally or vertically aligned.

3. **Output**: The program prints the smaller of the two squared distances `n` and `x`. However, the area of the square should be the square of the side length, which is the distance between two adjacent corners.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for the given input.

Correctness: **False**
