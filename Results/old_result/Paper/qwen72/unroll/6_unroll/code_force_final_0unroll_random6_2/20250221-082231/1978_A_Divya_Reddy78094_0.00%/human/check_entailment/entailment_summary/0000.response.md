Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two non-empty piles and reading the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The provided program sorts the list of pages in descending order and then sums the two largest values. This approach is correct because the two largest values will always be the maximum number of pages Alice can read, regardless of how the books are divided into piles. The program handles multiple test cases as required and ensures that each test case processes the input correctly and outputs the expected result.

Correctness: **True**
