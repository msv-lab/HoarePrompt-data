Output State: **`total_costs` is a list of sums of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`, starting from the first element up to the `(n - k + 1)`-th element. The lengths of `rows`, `costs`, and `total_costs` are `n`, `n`, and `n - k + 1` respectively. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`) remain unchanged.**
