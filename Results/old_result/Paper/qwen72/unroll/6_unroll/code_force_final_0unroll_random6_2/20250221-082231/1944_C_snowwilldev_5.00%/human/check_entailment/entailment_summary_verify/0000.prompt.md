You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. For each test case, it reads `N` and the list `a`, counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`, and then prints the first integer `i` (0 <= i < N) that either appears exactly once in `a` or is missing from `a`. If two unique integers are found that appear exactly once, it prints the first such integer and breaks out of the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the input variables `a` and `N` are consumed, and the function has no side effects on external state other than printing the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains multiple elements that are the same, and these elements are the smallest non-negative integers. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
0 0 0 1 1 1
```

The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 0, `a = [0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 0, `a = [0, 1, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 1, `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
4. Bob picks 0, `a = [1, 1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
5. Alice picks 1, `a = [1]`, `c = [0, 1, 1]`.
6. Bob picks 1, `a = []`, `c = [0, 1, 1]`.

The MEX of `c` is 2, but the program will output 0 because it incorrectly assumes that if a number appears only once, it should be included in the MEX calculation. This logic fails to consider the optimal strategy where both players can choose the same number multiple times, leading to an incorrect MEX calculation.
