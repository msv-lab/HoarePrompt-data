Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program constructs a permutation `p` of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p[i]` divides `p[j]` and `p[i+1]` divides `p[j+1]`. The approach used in the program is to place the largest numbers in the even indices and the smallest numbers in the odd indices, which ensures that the conditions are met. This is because the largest numbers are placed in a way that they do not consecutively follow each other, and the smallest numbers are placed in a way that they do not consecutively follow each other either. This strategy prevents the formation of pairs where both elements in the pair can divide the corresponding elements in another pair. Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
