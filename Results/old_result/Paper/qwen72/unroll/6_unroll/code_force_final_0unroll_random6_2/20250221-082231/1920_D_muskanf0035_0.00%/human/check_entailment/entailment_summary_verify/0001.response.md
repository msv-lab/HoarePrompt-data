### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires simulating operations on an array and answering queries about the k-th element of the resulting array.
   - The operations can either append a single integer or append multiple copies of the current array to itself.
   - The constraints are such that the number of operations and queries can be up to \(10^5\), and the number of copies in the second type of operation can be up to \(10^9\).

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the results of the queries.
   - **Operation Handling**:
     - For `op_type == 1`, the function appends the integer `value` to the array. This is correct.
     - For `op_type == 2`, the function appends `value` copies of the current array to itself. However, the implementation uses a list comprehension to extend the array, which is inefficient and can lead to memory issues for large values of `value`. Specifically, the line `array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])` is repeated `value` times, causing the array to grow exponentially.
   - **Query Handling**: The function iterates through the queries and appends the k-th element of the array to the `result` list using `(k - 1) % len(array)`. This is correct and ensures that the k-th element is correctly determined even if the array is repeated multiple times.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - **Reading Operations and Queries**: For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the operations and queries.
   - **Calling Function 1**: It calls `func_1` with the number of operations, the list of operations, and the list of queries.
   - **Output**: It prints the results of the queries for each test case. This is correct.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Memory and Performance**: The current implementation of `func_1` is highly inefficient and memory-intensive, especially for large values of `x` in the second type of operation. This can lead to performance issues or memory errors, particularly when `x` is very large (up to \(10^9\)).
   - **Exponential Growth**: The array grows exponentially with each `op_type == 2` operation, which is not scalable for large inputs.

5. **Correctness**:
   - While the logic for handling the operations and queries is correct, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs.
   - The program may fail to run within reasonable time or memory limits for the given constraints, especially when `x` in the second type of operation is large.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct but is not efficient and may fail to handle large inputs within the constraints. Given the problem constraints, the program is not suitable for practical use and should be considered incorrect due to its inefficiency.

Final: **False**
