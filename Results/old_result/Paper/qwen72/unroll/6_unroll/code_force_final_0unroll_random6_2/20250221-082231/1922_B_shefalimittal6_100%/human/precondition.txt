The function `main` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, which is 2^{a_i}. The function should read the input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
