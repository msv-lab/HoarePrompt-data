### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It then reads the grid of depths `rows`.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the minimum cost to install supports for a single row.
   - The function initializes the first cell of the row with a cost of 1 (since the depth is 0 and the cost is `a_{i,1} + 1`).
   - It then iterates through the first `d` cells, setting their costs to `a_{i,j} + 2` (since the cost is `a_{i,j} + 1` and an additional 1 for the support).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the last `d` cells.
   - For each subsequent cell, it ensures that the distance between the current cell and the last support is no more than `d` by popping elements from the heap that are too far.
   - It then updates the cost of the current cell by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell.
   - The function returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

3. **Total Cost Calculation for Multiple Rows:**
   - The function `func_2` calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost for that row.
   - It then computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and appends these costs to `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum cost from `total_costs`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 by simply returning the cost of the single row.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than 1 by considering all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the program efficiently finds the minimum cost for each cell within the distance `d`.
   - The overall complexity is manageable given the constraints, especially since the sum of `n * m` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Initialization:**
  - `row[0] = 1` sets the cost of the first cell to 1, which is correct because the depth is 0 and the cost is `a_{i,1} + 1`.
  - The loop `for i in range(1, d): row[i] = row[i] + 2` correctly sets the cost of the first `d` cells to `a_{i,j} + 2`, which is the cost of the support plus the depth plus 1.
- **Heap Operations:**
  - The min-heap is initialized with the first `d` cells.
  - The loop `for i in range(d, len(row))` iterates through the remaining cells.
  - The `while` loop ensures that only the relevant elements (within distance `d`) are considered in the heap.
  - The cost of the current cell is updated by adding the minimum cost from the heap and the cost of the current cell.
  - The updated cell is then pushed back into the heap.
- **Return Value:**
  - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the total cost of installing supports for the row.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Input Parsing:**
  - The function correctly reads the input for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
  - It then reads the grid of depths `rows`.
- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The function calls `func_1` for each row to get the minimum cost for that row.
  - It then computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and appends these costs to `total_costs`.
- **Output:**
  - The function prints the minimum cost from `total_costs`, which is the correct approach to find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of installing supports for each row and then for the set of `k` consecutive rows.
- The use of the min-heap ensures that the program efficiently handles the constraints and finds the correct minimum cost.
- The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.

Final: **True**
