The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `data` and `results` are not directly relevant to the loop head, but `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `idx` is also not directly relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from the standard input stream, `idx` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**
