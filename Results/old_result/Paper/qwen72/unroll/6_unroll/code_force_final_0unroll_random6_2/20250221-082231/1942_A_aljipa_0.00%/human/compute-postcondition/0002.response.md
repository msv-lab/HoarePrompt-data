Output State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` equals `n`, it will print an array of `n` ones. If `k` equals 1, it will print the sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If neither condition is met, it will print `-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` will be unchanged after the loop finishes, but the output will be the result of the print statements for each test case.
