The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= r <= l < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing an operation. The function updates the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` to contain the value `n` (which is equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive, and returns the updated list `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, and returns the list `lst` where the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` has been updated to contain the value `n` (equal to `l - r + 1`) for all indices from `r` to `l` inclusive.**
