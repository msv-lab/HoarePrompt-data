### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array `a` is strictly increasing.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `order` if the current element is not greater than the previous element.
   - If `order` remains 0, it returns `True`, indicating the array is strictly increasing. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the array is already strictly increasing, and the beauty of the array is 0 (since no rearrangement is needed).
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, the program sorts the array `a` and calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly checks if the array is strictly increasing. However, it is not necessary to check if the array is strictly increasing before sorting it. The maximum beauty can always be achieved by sorting the array, regardless of its initial order.
  - Therefore, the check using `func_1` is redundant and can be removed.

- **Sorting and Calculating Beauty:**
  - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which maximizes the sum of these differences.
  - The calculation of the beauty is correct: it sums the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Conclusion:
- The program is mostly correct in its logic for calculating the maximum beauty of the array.
- However, the use of `func_1` is unnecessary and can be removed to simplify the code and improve efficiency.

### Correctness:
- **Correctness: **False**

### Suggested Fix:
- Remove the `func_1` function and the conditional check. Always sort the array and calculate the beauty.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    beauty = 0
    b = sorted(a)
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected program will always produce the correct output for the given problem description.
