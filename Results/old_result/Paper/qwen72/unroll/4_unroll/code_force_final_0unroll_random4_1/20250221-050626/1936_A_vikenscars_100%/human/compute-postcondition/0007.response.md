The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint that 2 <= n <= 10^4. The function returns a value based on the input `n`.

Since the output details are not provided, I will assume the function returns a value that is relevant to the input `n` within the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^4 and returns a value based on the input `n`.**
