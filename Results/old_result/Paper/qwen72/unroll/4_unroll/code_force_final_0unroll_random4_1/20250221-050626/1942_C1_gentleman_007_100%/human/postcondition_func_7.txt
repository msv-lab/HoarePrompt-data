The function `func_8` accepts a 2D list `l` of integers, where each sublist has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` of integers with dimensions `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of `l`. Each element `p[i][j]` (for `1 <= i <= n` and `1 <= j <= m`) represents the sum of all elements in `l` from the top-left corner `(0,0)` to the position `(i-1, j-1)`. The first row and first column of `p` are all zeros.
