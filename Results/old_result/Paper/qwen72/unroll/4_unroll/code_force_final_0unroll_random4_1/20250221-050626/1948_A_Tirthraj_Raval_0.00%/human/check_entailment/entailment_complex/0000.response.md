Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, each time reading a new value of `n`. This matches the problem description.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters. This is because each special character must be part of a pair (either "AA" or "BB" or "AB" or "BA"), and an odd number of such pairs cannot be formed. Therefore, printing "NO" for odd `n` is correct.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function constructs a string that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. This ensures that each character in the string is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, making each character special. The length of the string is `n`, which is correct.

4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern construction uses a loop that runs `n // 2` times, appending 'A' and 'B' alternately. This results in a string of length `n` with the required properties.

5. **Output**: The function prints the correct output for each test case, either "NO" for odd `n` or "YES" followed by the constructed string for even `n`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 (which is odd) correctly by printing "NO". It also handles the case where `n` is 2 by printing "YES" followed by "AB" or "BA".

7. **String Length**: The function ensures that the generated string is of length `n`, which is within the allowed limit of 200 characters as specified in the problem description.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
