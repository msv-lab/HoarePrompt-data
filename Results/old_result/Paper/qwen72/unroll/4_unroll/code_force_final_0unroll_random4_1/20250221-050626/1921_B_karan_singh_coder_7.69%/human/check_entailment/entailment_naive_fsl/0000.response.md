Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the number of '1's in the initial and desired positions are the same, but the positions of the '1's are such that the minimum number of operations required is not equal to the number of '1's. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5
10000
00001
```

The initial and desired positions both have one '1', so `s1 == t1`. The program calculates `cnt` as 4 because there are 4 positions where `s[i] != t[i]`. However, the correct answer should be 2, as you can move the cat from the first box to the fifth box in 2 operations (one move and one no-op or vice versa). The program incorrectly prints `1` in this case.
