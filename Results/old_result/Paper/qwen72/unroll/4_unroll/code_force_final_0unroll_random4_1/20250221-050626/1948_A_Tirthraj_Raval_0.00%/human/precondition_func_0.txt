The function should accept an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) as input, and handle multiple test cases where the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) is provided. The function should return a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be constructed, the function should return "NO".
