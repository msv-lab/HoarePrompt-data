Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the logic for determining "NONE" correctly. Specifically, the `else` block is only associated with the second `if` statement, which means that if `a < b > c` is not true, it will print "NONE" regardless of whether the first condition `a < b < c` was true. This can lead to incorrect outputs.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

In this corrected version, the `elif` statement ensures that only one of the conditions is checked and printed, and the `else` block is only executed if neither of the conditions is true.
