The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It internally handles multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`. These binary strings represent the two rows of a 2 × n grid. The function processes these inputs to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing the grid from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and it also returns the number of distinct paths that yield this smallest string. The total number of test cases, `t`, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
