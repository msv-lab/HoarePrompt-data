The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts mentions that `x` is an input integer such that 0 <= x <= 9. For the loop to execute, `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and starts at 0.

State: **`x` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 9, `i` is 0**
