Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30`. For each test case, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the function prints `-1`. If the sum is even, the function prints the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified and remain as they were read from the input. **
