### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program iterates through the permutation to find the indices with the maximum XOR value.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to perform the queries and receive the results.

3. **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
   - **Initial Setup:**
     - The program reads the number of test cases and the length of the permutation \( n \).
     - It initializes `ans1` to 0, which will store the index of the element with the maximum value in the permutation.
   - **Finding the Maximum Element:**
     - The first loop iterates through the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and uses `func_1` to compare \( p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \).
     - If \( p_i \mid p_i \) is greater, `ans1` is updated to \( i \). This loop effectively finds the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
     - The second loop iterates through the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and uses `func_1` to compare \( p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1} \) with \( p_i \mid p_{ans1} \).
     - If \( p_i \mid p_{ans1} \) is greater, `mx` is updated to \( i \) and `v` is reset to contain only \( i \).
     - If \( p_i \mid p_{ans1} \) is equal to \( p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1} \), \( i \) is added to `v`.
   - **Final Comparison:**
     - The third loop iterates through the list `v` and uses `func_1` to compare \( p_{ans} \mid p_{ans} \) with \( p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]} \).
     - If \( p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]} \) is greater, `ans` is updated to \( v[i] \).
   - **Output the Result:**
     - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` which are supposed to give the maximum XOR value.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Finding the Maximum Element:**
     - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - **Finding the Second Maximum Element:**
     - The second loop correctly identifies the indices that, when combined with `ans1`, give the maximum value of \( p_i \mid p_{ans1} \).
   - **Final Comparison:**
     - The third loop is unnecessary because the maximum XOR value is achieved by the maximum element and the element that, when combined with the maximum element, gives the maximum value of \( p_i \mid p_{ans1} \).
   - **Query Count:**
     - The program uses \( n-1 \) queries in the first loop and \( n-1 \) queries in the second loop, totaling \( 2n-2 \) queries. This is within the limit of \( 3n \) queries.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - The third loop is redundant and can be removed, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness: **True**
