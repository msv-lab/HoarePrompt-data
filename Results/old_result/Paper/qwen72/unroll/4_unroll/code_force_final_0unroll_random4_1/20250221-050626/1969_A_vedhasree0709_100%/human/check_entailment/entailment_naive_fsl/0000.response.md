Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed for cases where the friends' best friend relationships do not form a simple 2-cycle (i.e., pairs of friends who are each other's best friends).

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```
In this case, the best friend relationships form a cycle of length 6: 
- Friend 1's best friend is Friend 2.
- Friend 2's best friend is Friend 3.
- Friend 3's best friend is Friend 4.
- Friend 4's best friend is Friend 5.
- Friend 5's best friend is Friend 6.
- Friend 6's best friend is Friend 1.

To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends (e.g., Friends 1, 2, and 3). However, the program will print `2` because it only checks for 2-cycles and does not handle longer cycles correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Identify all cycles in the best friend relationships.
2. Determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, considering the lengths of the cycles.

The provided program does not handle cycles of length greater than 2, leading to incorrect results in such cases.
