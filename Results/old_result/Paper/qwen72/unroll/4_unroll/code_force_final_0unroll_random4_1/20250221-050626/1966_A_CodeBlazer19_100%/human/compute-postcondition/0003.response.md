The function `min_cards_left` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), followed by a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100) representing the numbers on the cards. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the minimum number of cards left after performing the operation for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` and a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards. It returns a list of integers, each representing the minimum number of cards left after performing the operation for each test case.**
