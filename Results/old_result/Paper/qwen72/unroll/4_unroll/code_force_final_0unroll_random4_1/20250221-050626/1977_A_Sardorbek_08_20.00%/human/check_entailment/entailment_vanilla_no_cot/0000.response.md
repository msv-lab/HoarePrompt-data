Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in the condition checking. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves `n` or the target number of cubes `m`.

The correct condition should be `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` to check if the number of moves `n` and the target number of cubes `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can only be `m` if `n` and `m` have the same parity.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and n % 2 == m % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
2. **Condition Checking**:
   - `if n >= m and n % 2 == m % 2:`: This condition checks if the number of moves `n` is at least the target number of cubes `m` and if `n` and `m` have the same parity.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

This corrected program will correctly determine if it is possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
