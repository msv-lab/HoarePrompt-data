Reasoning:

The given problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be minimized when the array is sorted in ascending order, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

However, the provided program does not calculate the beauty of the array. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string. This is incorrect because the program should output the maximum beauty, not the sorted array itself.

To fix this, the program should calculate the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) after sorting the array and print that sum.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        
        print(beauty)
```

This corrected version will correctly compute and print the maximum beauty of the array for each test case.
