Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row and a permutation, then assign the permutation to the row.
     - Type 2: Choose a column and a permutation, then assign the permutation to the column.
   - The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers multiplied by \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the series \( (i \times i - (i - 1) \times (i - 1)) \times i \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - This series simplifies to \( (2i - 1) \times i \), which is \( 2i^2 - i \).
   - The sum of this series is used to determine the maximum possible sum of the matrix.
   - The program then prints the calculated sum and \( 2n \) (the number of operations).
   - For each \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), it prints two operations:
     - Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Evaluating the Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The program's sum calculation is \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \), which is not the correct formula for the maximum sum.

4. **Evaluating the Operations**:
   - The program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is a valid permutation.
   - However, the operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. The operations are applied in a specific order, but they do not ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The sum calculation is incorrect.
   - The operations do not guarantee the maximum possible sum.

Correctness: **False**
