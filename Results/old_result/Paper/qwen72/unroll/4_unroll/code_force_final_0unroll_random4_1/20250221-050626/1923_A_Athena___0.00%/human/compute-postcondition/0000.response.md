Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of `t` lists, where each inner list contains two elements: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip. `t` is an input integer.**
