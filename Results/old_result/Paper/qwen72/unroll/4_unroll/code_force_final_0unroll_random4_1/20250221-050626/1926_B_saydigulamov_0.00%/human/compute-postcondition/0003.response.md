The function `func` accepts a parameter `grid` and an integer `t`. `grid` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` characters ('0' or '1'), and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. `t` is the number of test cases, and it is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The function returns the type of the shape (either "triangle" or "square") for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `grid`, a list of lists containing characters '0' or '1', and an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. It returns "triangle" if the grid contains a triangle that includes all '1's, and "square" if the grid contains a square that includes all '1's, for each test case.**
