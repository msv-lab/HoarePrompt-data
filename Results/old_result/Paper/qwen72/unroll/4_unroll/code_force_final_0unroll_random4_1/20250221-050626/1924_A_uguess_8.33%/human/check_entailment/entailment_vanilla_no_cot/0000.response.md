Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The program uses a bitwise operation to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, this approach does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. The bitwise operation is used to track the presence of characters, but it does not account for the order or the length of subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of times all `k` characters appear in the string `s`, but this is not the same as counting all possible subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence**: The construction of the missing subsequence in the `else` block is flawed. It does not generate a valid subsequence that is missing from `s`.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, you should print "NO" and the missing string. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    from itertools import product
    return [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        all_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
        for string in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(string, s):
                print('NO')
                print(string)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_subsequence**: This function checks if a string `x` is a subsequence of `s` by using an iterator and the `all` function.
2. **generate_all_strings**: This function generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets using `itertools.product`.
3. **func**: This function reads the input, generates all possible strings, and checks if each string is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the missing string. If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks for all possible subsequences and handles the problem as described.
