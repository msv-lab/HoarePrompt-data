Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It is designed to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes two lists of integers, `a_i` and `b_i`, and two integers, `n` and `m`. The function returns a result for each test case based on the processing of these lists and integers. If `t` is the number of test cases, the function will return `t` results. Each result is determined by the relationship between the elements of `a_i` and `b_i`, and the constraints on `n` and `m`.**
