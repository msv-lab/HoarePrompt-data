Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n`. For each test case, it computes and prints the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by traversing the grid represented by the two strings, and the number of distinct paths that yield this smallest string. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is undefined for the variables used within the function. **
