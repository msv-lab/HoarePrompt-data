Postcondition: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` and `M2` are positive integers such that `1 <= M1, M2 <= N`, and both `M1` and `M2` are greater than 1. `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `prefix_max_indices`, and `suffix_max_indices` retain their initial conditions. `L` is a list of integers input by the user, with `L[0]` being 1 and the last element of `L` being equal to the first element of `R`. `R` is a list of integers input by the user, with `R[0]` being `N`. Additionally, the second-to-last element of `L` is equal to the second element of `R`.**
