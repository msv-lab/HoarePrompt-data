You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue

            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each iteration, it will take three integers p1, p2, and p3 as input. If the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, it will print -1. If p3 is greater than or equal to the sum of p1 and p2, it will print the sum of p1 and p2. Otherwise, it will print the maximum possible score that can be achieved by adjusting the scores of the players, which is either p1 - x + p3 or p3, depending on the conditions inside the loop. The values of p1, p2, and p3 will be re-assigned in each iteration, and the loop will continue until all t iterations are completed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly calculate the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. One such case is when the scores are (1, 1, 2). According to the problem description, the maximum number of draws that could have happened is 2, but the program outputs 3, which is incorrect.

Let's break down the logic for the input (1, 1, 2):

1. The total score is \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\), which is even, so the program does not immediately return -1.
2. The program then checks if \(p3 \geq p1 + p2\). In this case, \(2 < 1 + 1\), so it enters the else block.
3. Inside the else block, the program initializes \(x = 0\) and \(y = p3 = 2\).
4. The while loop runs as long as \(y \geq x\):
   - First iteration: \(x = 0\), \(y = 2\). The condition \(p1 - x \leq p2 - y\) is \(1 - 0 \leq 1 - 2\), which is false, so it increments \(x\) and decrements \(y\).
   - Second iteration: \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\). The condition \(p1 - x \leq p2 - y\) is \(1 - 1 \leq 1 - 1\), which is true, so it prints \(p1 - x + p3 = 1 - 1 + 2 = 2\).

However, the correct output for (1, 1, 2) should be 2, not 3. The program incorrectly calculates the maximum number of draws in this case.
