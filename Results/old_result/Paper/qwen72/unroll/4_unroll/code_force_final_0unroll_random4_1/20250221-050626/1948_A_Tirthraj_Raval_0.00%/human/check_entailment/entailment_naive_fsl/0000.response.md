Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 2 correctly. According to the problem description, a valid string for `n = 2` should have exactly 2 special characters. The program generates a string like "AB" for `n = 2`, but in "AB", there are no special characters because neither 'A' nor 'B' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. A correct string for `n = 2` would be "MM" or "AA", where each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
