### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex and then partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - It also uses a helper function `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the minimum number of cliques needed. The idea is to divide the vertices into groups of size at most k, which is a reasonable approach.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` iterates over each clique.
   - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: This function call is intended to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the current clique. The parameters are:
     - `left`: The starting index of the current clique.
     - `right`: The ending index of the current clique.
     - `clique`: The clique number.

4. **Function `make_array` Analysis:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables are used to determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the range of values.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements that are not in the midpoint range.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Checking the Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) should be satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that within each clique, the difference \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized, which helps in forming cliques.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \( 2 \le n \le 40 \) and \( 1 \le k \le 2n \).

- **Function `func_1` State:**
  - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: Correctly calculates the number of cliques.
  - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: Correctly initializes the arrays.
  - The loop `for i in range(cliques)`: Iterates over each clique correctly.
  - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: Correctly calls `make_array` to populate the arrays for each clique.

- **Function `make_array` State:**
  - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: Correctly determines the range of values.
  - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: Correctly calculates the midpoint.
  - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: Correctly calculates the number of elements not in the midpoint range.
  - The first loop `for i in range(mid)`: Correctly assigns the smaller values to the vertices in the current clique.
  - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)`: Correctly assigns the larger values to the vertices in the current clique.

- **Final State:**
  - `arr` is correctly filled with distinct integers from 1 to n.
  - `cliques` is correctly calculated and printed.
  - `cliquess` is correctly filled with the clique assignments and printed.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Edge Condition Verification:**
  - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) needs to be verified for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
  - The current implementation of `make_array` ensures that the values are assigned in a way that minimizes the difference \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \), but it does not explicitly check the edge condition in the code. However, the logic of the assignment should inherently satisfy the condition for the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

- The provided solution correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assigns values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied.
- The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.
- The annotated code confirms that the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are populated correctly and the output format is correct.

Final: **True**
