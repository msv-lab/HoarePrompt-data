The value of `t` is assigned the result of converting the user input to an integer. The variable `s` remains a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function will still be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases is now specified by the integer `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `s` is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
