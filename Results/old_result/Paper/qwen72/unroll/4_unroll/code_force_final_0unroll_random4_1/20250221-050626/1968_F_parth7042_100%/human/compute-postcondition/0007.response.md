To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is the index of the first element after the last element used in the loop.
- `t` is an integer value.
- `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings based on the loop's conditions.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list that contains 'YES' or 'NO' strings. These strings are determined by some conditions in a loop that is not provided in the code snippet.
   - The exact content of `results` depends on the conditions evaluated in the loop.

2. **Joining the List**:
   - The `'\n'.join(results)` function call will concatenate all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

3. **Printing the Result**:
   - The `print` statement will output the concatenated string, which means each element of `results` will be printed on a new line.

### Output:
Since the exact content of `results` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the possible values 'YES' or 'NO'. The output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each on a new line.

Output: **'YES' or 'NO' (where each 'YES' or 'NO' is an element from the `results` list, and each element is printed on a new line)**
