The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `cases`, a list of lists where each inner list contains `n` integers. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, with each integer `a_i` in the inner lists being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The exact output for each test case is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the input integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains `n` positive integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the processing of the input integers.**
