The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`). For each test case, if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this result. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not modified by the function.
