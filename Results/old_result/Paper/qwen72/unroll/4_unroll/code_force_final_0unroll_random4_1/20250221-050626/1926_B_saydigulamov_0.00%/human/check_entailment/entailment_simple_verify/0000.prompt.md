You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a grid represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains n characters '0' or '1', and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape's size is greater than 1. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then `n` lines of input representing a grid. If any of these grids contain exactly two rows with the same number of '1's, it prints a list of the counts of '1's in those rows. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the shape (triangle or square) based on the input grid. It only appends the count of '1's in each row to a list `k` and checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal. This logic is insufficient to determine the shape correctly for all cases. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
3
001
011
111
3
111
111
111
```

For the first test case, the grid is:
```
001
011
111
```
The program will append the counts `[1, 2, 3]` to `k`, and since `k[0]` (1) is not equal to `k[1]` (2), it will not print anything, which is incorrect because the shape is a triangle.

For the second test case, the grid is:
```
111
111
111
```
The program will append the counts `[3, 3, 3]` to `k`, and since `k[0]` (3) is equal to `k[1]` (3), it will print the list `[3, 3, 3]`, which is incorrect because the shape is a square and the output should be "SQUARE".

The program fails to correctly identify the shape in both of these cases. Therefore, it is incorrect.
