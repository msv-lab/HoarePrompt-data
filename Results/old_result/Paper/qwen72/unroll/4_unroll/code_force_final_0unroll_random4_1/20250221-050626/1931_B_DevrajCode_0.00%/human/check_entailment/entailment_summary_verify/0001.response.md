### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires handling multiple test cases, each with a different number of containers and different initial amounts of water.
   - For each test case, we need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The sum of the amounts of water in each test case is divisible by the number of containers `n`.
   - The target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target, we need to ensure that the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount does not become negative at any point during the iteration.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water for each container.
   - It iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `container` between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If `container` becomes negative at any point, it means that the current container has less water than the target, and there is no way to pour water from a container with more water to this container without violating the `i < j` condition.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means it is possible to achieve the target amount of water in all containers.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read in one go and split into a list of integers.
   - The first integer `t` is the number of test cases.
   - The subsequent integers are the amounts of water in the containers for each test case.
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm implemented in `func_1` is correct for a single test case.
   - However, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases. To fix this, the program should read and process each test case individually. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    a = list(map(int, data[index + 1:index + 1 + n]))
    index += 1 + n
    print(func_1(n, a))
```

This corrected version reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually, ensuring that the program handles multiple test cases correctly.
