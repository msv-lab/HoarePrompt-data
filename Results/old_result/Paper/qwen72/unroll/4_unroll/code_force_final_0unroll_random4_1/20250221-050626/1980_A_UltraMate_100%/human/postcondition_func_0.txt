The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the number of additional occurrences required for each character in `p` ('A' to 'G') to appear at least `m` times in `s`, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are no longer needed, and the variable `ans` used for calculation is reset for each test case.
