The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The function returns 'No' in one case and 'Yes' in another case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. If the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`, the function returns 'Yes'. If the sum of the integers in `a` is not divisible by `n`, the function returns 'No'.**
