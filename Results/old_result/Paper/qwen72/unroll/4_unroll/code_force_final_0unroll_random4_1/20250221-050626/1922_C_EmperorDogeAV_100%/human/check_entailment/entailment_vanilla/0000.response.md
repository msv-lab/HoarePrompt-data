### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to very large and very small values, respectively, to handle edge cases where a city might be the first or last in the list.
   - For each city, it updates `back` and `forward` to the coordinates of the previous and next cities, respectively.
   - It then compares the distances to the previous and next cities and assigns the cost to `prog_cities[i]`:
     - If the next city is closer, it assigns 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
     - Otherwise, it assigns the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, for forward and backward travel costs, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated for the original city list.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated for the reversed city list and then reversed back to align with the original indices.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array `pref_sum_f` to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array `pref_sum_b` to calculate the cost.

### Issues:
- **Closest City Calculation**:
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the assignment of `prog_cities[i]`. It should always assign 1 if the next city is closer, and the distance to the next city if the previous city is closer.
  - The current implementation assigns 1 if the next city is closer, but incorrectly assigns the distance to the previous city otherwise. It should assign the distance to the next city.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
  - The prefix sum arrays are correctly calculated, but the logic in `func_1` needs to be fixed to ensure the correct values are assigned to `prog_cities`.

- **Query Processing**:
  - The query processing logic is correct, but it relies on the incorrect values from `func_1`.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Cost to travel to the next city
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])  # Distance to the next city
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:
- The original program has a logical error in the `func_1` function, which affects the correctness of the prefix sum arrays and, consequently, the query results.
- After correcting the `func_1` function, the program should work correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
