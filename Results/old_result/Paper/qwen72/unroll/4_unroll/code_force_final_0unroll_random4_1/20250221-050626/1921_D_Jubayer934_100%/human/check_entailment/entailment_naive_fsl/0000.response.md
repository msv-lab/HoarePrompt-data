Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle the case where the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` are different, specifically when `m > n`. The program incorrectly processes the array `b` by taking the first `m` elements and sorting them in reverse order, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

**Example of Incorrect Behavior:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
3 4
1 2 3
10 20 30 40
```

Expected output:
```
60
```

Explanation: Vasya can choose the largest elements from `b` to maximize the difference. For example, he can choose `c = [40, 30, 20]`. The total difference would be:
```
|1 - 40| + |2 - 30| + |3 - 20| = 39 + 28 + 17 = 84
```

However, the program will output:
```
54
```

This is because the program incorrectly processes the array `b` by taking the first `m` elements and sorting them in reverse order, which in this case is `[40, 30, 20, 10]`. It then uses the first `n` elements of this sorted array, which are `[40, 30, 20]`, and calculates the difference as:
```
|1 - 40| + |2 - 30| + |3 - 20| = 39 + 28 + 17 = 84
```

But due to the logic in the program, it incorrectly uses the last `n` elements of the sorted array in reverse order, which are `[10, 20, 30]`, and calculates the difference as:
```
|1 - 10| + |2 - 20| + |3 - 30| = 9 + 18 + 27 = 54
```

Thus, the program does not always produce the maximum possible difference, making it incorrect.
