Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical issue in the condition used to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Specifically, the condition `if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is not correct for all cases.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
5 3 2
```
Here, `n = 5`, `m = 3`, and `k = 2`.

- According to the program, `n <= k` is `False` (5 is not less than or equal to 2).
- The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` evaluates to `5 - math.ceil(5 / 3) < 2`, which simplifies to `5 - 2 < 2`, or `3 < 2`, which is `False`.

Thus, the program will print `Yes` for this test case.

However, Alice can paint the ribbon as follows: `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. Bob can only repaint 2 parts, and no matter which 2 parts he repaints, he cannot make all 5 parts the same color. Therefore, the correct output should be `YES`.

The issue lies in the condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. This condition does not correctly capture the logic required to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon such that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. A correct condition would be to check if `k < n - m`, which ensures that Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color if Alice uses at least `m` different colors.

Thus, the program is incorrect for the given test case.
