Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times, each time reading three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1` is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to have an odd total score if each game results in either 2 points (win/loss) or 2 points (draw).

3. **Calculation of Draws**: If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the constraints of the problem:
   - The total points must be even.
   - The maximum number of draws is determined by the minimum number of wins needed to achieve the scores, which is given by `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case `0 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` because no games were played.
   - For the case `0 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because one draw is possible.
   - For the case `1 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case `1 1 2`, the program correctly outputs `2` because two draws are possible.
   - For the case `3 3 3`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to achieve these scores with the given rules.
   - For the case `3 4 5`, the program correctly outputs `6` because six draws are possible.
   - For the case `1 1 10`, the program correctly outputs `2` because two draws are possible.

The program handles all the given examples correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
