Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). However, the program in `func_1` is not implementing this logic at all. Instead, it seems to be doing some unrelated calculations involving the square root of `n` and a loop that modifies `ans` in a way that does not correspond to the problem's requirements.

Here is a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

1. For each pair (a, b), calculate \( \gcd(a, b) \).
2. Check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
3. Count the number of such pairs.

A correct implementation would look something like this:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = math.gcd(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This implementation correctly checks each pair (a, b) and counts the valid ones. However, it is not efficient enough to handle the constraints \( 1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 \) and \( t \le 10^4 \). For such large inputs, a more optimized approach would be necessary, but the provided program is not even attempting to solve the problem correctly.
