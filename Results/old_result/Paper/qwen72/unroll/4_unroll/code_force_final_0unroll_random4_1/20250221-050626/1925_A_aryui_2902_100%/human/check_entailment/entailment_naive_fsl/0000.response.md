Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not generate a string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function `func_1` simply repeats the first `k` letters of the alphabet `n` times, which does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in the resulting string.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The program will output `abcabc`. However, this string does not contain the subsequence `cc`, which is one of the possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`a`, `b`, and `c`). The correct output should be a string that includes all possible subsequences of length 2, such as `abcbac`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
