Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - The goal is to maximize this sum by rearranging the elements of the array in any order.

2. **Optimal Rearrangement**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - The program then sorts the array and prints the sorted array elements.

4. **Output Mismatch**:
   - The program prints the sorted array elements, but the problem requires the output to be the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The beauty should be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, but the program does not perform this calculation.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should calculate the beauty after sorting the array and print the result for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not calculate the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **False**
