The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, representing the number of edges to be marked. It returns an (n+1) x (n+1) adjacency matrix `l`, where for each pair of integers (x, y) returned by `func_1()` during the loop iterations, the elements `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1, and all other elements in `l` remain 0. The parameters `n` and `m` are unchanged after the function execution.
