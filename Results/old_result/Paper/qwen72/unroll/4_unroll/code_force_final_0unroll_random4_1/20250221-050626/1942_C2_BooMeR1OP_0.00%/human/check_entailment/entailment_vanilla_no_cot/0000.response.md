Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Specifically, the way it handles the gaps between the chosen vertices and the addition of new vertices to maximize the number of triangles is not entirely correct.

### Issues:
1. **Initial Triangle Count Calculation**:
   - The initial triangle count `ans = x - 2` is incorrect. For a polygon with `x` chosen vertices, the number of triangles that can be formed by connecting these vertices with non-intersecting diagonals is `x - 2` only if the vertices form a convex polygon. However, this is not always the case, especially when the vertices are not consecutive.

2. **Handling Gaps**:
   - The program attempts to add new vertices to maximize the number of triangles by considering gaps between the chosen vertices. However, the logic for adding vertices and counting triangles is flawed.
   - The program uses `gap // 2` to determine the number of pairs of vertices that can be added, but this does not correctly account for the fact that adding a vertex in a gap can create multiple new triangles, depending on the position of the new vertex and the existing vertices.

3. **Triangle Count Update**:
   - The update to the triangle count `ans += gap` or `ans += 2 * y` is incorrect. Adding a vertex in a gap can create more than one triangle, and the program does not correctly account for this.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. **Sort and Normalize the Chosen Vertices**: Ensure the vertices are sorted and normalized to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
2. **Calculate Initial Triangles**: Use a more accurate method to calculate the initial number of triangles that can be formed with the chosen vertices.
3. **Add Vertices to Maximize Triangles**: Carefully add vertices to the gaps to maximize the number of triangles, considering the impact of each new vertex on the existing structure.

### Example Fix:
Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def func_1():
    (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [num - 1 for num in a]
    a.sort()
    a.append(a[0] + n)  # Extend the list to handle circular nature

    present = set(a[:-1])
    ans = 0

    # Calculate initial triangles
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[i + 1]
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        if gap == 0:
            ans += 1
        elif gap == 1:
            ans += 2
        else:
            ans += 2 + (gap - 2) // 2

    # Calculate additional triangles by adding vertices
    gaps = [a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1 for i in range(x)]
    gaps.sort()

    for gap in gaps:
        if y == 0:
            break
        if gap == 0 or gap == 1:
            continue
        pairs = (gap - 1) // 2
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += pairs
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += y
            break

    print(ans)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Triangle Calculation**: The initial triangle count is calculated by considering the gaps between consecutive vertices. If the gap is 0, it means the vertices are adjacent and form a triangle. If the gap is 1, it means there is one vertex in between, forming two triangles. For larger gaps, the formula `2 + (gap - 2) // 2` is used to count the triangles.
- **Adding Vertices**: The program then sorts the gaps and adds vertices to the largest gaps first, updating the triangle count accordingly.

This approach should correctly handle the problem constraints and provide the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
