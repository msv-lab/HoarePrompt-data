i is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of disks. x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. r is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. visited is a list of booleans, where visited[i] is False if the i-th disk has not been visited, and True otherwise. nodes is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks that have been visited. coef0 and coef1 are lists of integers or real numbers, where coef0[i] and coef1[i] are the coefficients used to adjust the radii of the disks.
