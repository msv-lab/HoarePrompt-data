Output State: **The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The loop has executed all iterations and printed the results for each test case, but the function itself has not been updated to match the problem description.**
