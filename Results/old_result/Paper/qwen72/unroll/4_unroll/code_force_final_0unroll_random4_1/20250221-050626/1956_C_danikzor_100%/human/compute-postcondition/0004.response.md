The function `func_1` does not take any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is provided in the input, and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the output for a specific test case.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` representing the size of an n×n matrix. It returns a list of results, one for each test case.**
