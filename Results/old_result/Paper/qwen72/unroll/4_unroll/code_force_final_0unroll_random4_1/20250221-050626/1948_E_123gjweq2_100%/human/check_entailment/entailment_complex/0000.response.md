Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for dividing the vertices into the minimum number of cliques based on the given `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct because each clique can have at most `k` vertices.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, to store the assigned integers and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - It then iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the segments of `arr` and `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array` Analysis**:
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for filling a segment of the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays with values and clique assignments.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` to determine the range of values to be assigned.
   - It divides the segment into two halves and assigns values in a specific order to ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` is met for all pairs within the same clique.
   - The first half of the segment is filled with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the second half is filled with values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.
   - The `cliquess` array is updated to reflect the clique assignment for the segment.

3. **Output Verification**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the `arr` array, which contains the assigned integers for each vertex.
   - It prints the number of cliques, which is `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It prints the `cliquess` array, which should contain the clique assignments for each vertex.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The solution ensures that each vertex is assigned a unique integer from 1 to `n`.
   - The number of cliques is minimized as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function correctly assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` to ensure that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k` is met for all pairs within the same clique.
   - The output format matches the problem description, with each test case printing the assigned integers, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

However, there is a critical issue in the `func_1` function:
- The `cliquess` array is not being printed correctly. The comment states that it prints a list of `n` zeros, which is incorrect. The `cliquess` array should contain the clique assignments, not zeros.

Given this issue, the program does not meet the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**
