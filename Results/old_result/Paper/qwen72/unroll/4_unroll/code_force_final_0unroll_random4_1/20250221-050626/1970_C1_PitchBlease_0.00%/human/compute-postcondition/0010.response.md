The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of nodes in a tree. `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, and each tuple represents an edge connecting two nodes in the tree. `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game. The function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the game's outcome.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. It returns 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the game's outcome starting from the node `start` in a tree with `n` nodes and edges defined by `edges`.**
