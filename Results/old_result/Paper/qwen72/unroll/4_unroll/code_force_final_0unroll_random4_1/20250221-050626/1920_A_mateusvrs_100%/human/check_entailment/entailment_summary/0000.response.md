### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the constraints as pairs `(a, x)` and processes them accordingly.

2. **Constraint Processing:**
   - For constraints of type 1 (k ≥ x), the function updates `bx` to the maximum value of `x` seen so far. This ensures that `bx` is the smallest value that `k` must be greater than or equal to.
   - For constraints of type 2 (k ≤ x), the function updates `ax` to the minimum value of `x` seen so far. This ensures that `ax` is the largest value that `k` must be less than or equal to.
   - For constraints of type 3 (k ≠ x), the function adds `x` to the set `cx`. This set will contain all values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Validation and Counting:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is the case, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the minimum and maximum constraints, so it appends 0 to the result list.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the function calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range. This ensures that the values `k` must not be equal to are excluded from the count.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. It handles the constraints appropriately and ensures that the constraints of type 3 are excluded from the valid range. The use of `max` and `min` to find the bounds and the set to track the excluded values is sound and efficient.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
