Reasoning:

The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem by generating a string `s` that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. However, the implementation of `func_1` does not correctly achieve this goal. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Definition and Call Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is called without any arguments in the main loop, but it should be called with `n` and `k` as arguments. This is a clear mismatch and will result in an error.

2. **String Generation Logic**: The function generates a string by taking the first `k` characters of the English alphabet and repeating this substring `n` times. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function will return `"ababc"`. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included in the string `s`.

3. **Subsequence Requirement**: The problem requires that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` alphabets should be subsequences of the generated string `s`. The current implementation does not ensure this. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `"abcbac"` is a valid solution because it contains all possible subsequences of length 2 formed using `a`, `b`, and `c` (i.e., `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`). However, the function `func_1` returns `"ababc"`, which does not contain all these subsequences.

4. **Correct Approach**: To ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are included, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One such approach is to generate a de Bruijn sequence of order `n` on the alphabet of size `k`. A de Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length `n` appears exactly once as a substring.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
