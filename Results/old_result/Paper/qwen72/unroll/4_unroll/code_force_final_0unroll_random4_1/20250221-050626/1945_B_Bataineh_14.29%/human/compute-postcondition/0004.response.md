Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the function prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints the sum of `m` divided by `a`, `m` divided by `b`, and `2`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not modified within the function. **
