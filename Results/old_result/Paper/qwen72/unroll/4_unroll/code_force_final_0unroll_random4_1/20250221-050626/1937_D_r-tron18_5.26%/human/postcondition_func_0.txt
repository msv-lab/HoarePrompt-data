The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` such that 0 <= times <= len(arr). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. After the function concludes, the input list `arr` remains unchanged, and the function provides a numerical result representing this difference.
