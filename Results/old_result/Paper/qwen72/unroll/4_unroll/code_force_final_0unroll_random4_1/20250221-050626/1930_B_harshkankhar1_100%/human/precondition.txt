The function `solve` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by a single integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the permutation. The total number of test cases, t, is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
