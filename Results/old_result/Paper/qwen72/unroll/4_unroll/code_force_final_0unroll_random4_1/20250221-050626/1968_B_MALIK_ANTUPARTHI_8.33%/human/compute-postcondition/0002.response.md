Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. The variable `k` is updated based on the positions of characters in `d` within `e`. After the loop completes, `k` is printed for each test case. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the loop has no effect on the overall structure of the test cases.**
