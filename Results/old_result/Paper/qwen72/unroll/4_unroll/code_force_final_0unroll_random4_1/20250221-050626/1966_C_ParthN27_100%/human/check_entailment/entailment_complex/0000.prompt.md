Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner list is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            s.add(arr[i])
        
        s = list(s)
        
        s.sort()
        
        s = [0] + s
        
        ans = 1
        
        n = len(s)
        
        if n == 2:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                    break
                else:
                    ans ^= 1
            if ans:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, processes the list of integers, and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. After all iterations, the variables `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged, while the variables `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans` are reset to their initial states or modified as part of the loop's processing for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases, and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers from input. It then determines and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the unique sorted values of the integers. If the list of unique values contains exactly two elements, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between consecutive elements is at most 1, and prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the final value of a variable `ans` after processing. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the input variables `t` and the list of lists remain unchanged, while other variables (`n`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`) are reset for each test case.
