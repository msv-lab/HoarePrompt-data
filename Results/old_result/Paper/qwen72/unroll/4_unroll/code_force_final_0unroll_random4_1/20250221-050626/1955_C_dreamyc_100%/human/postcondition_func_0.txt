The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns either `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`, or it returns the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the sum of the first `a` elements and the sum of the last `b` elements, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2. Each element is counted at most once in this sum.
