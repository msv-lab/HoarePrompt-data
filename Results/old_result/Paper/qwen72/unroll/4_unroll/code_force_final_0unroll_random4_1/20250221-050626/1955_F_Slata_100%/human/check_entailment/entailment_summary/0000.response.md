### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the XOR is non-zero, and Bob wins if the XOR is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of zero with any number is the number itself: \( 0 \oplus x = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( x \oplus y = y \oplus x \) and \( (x \oplus y) \oplus z = x \oplus (y \oplus z) \).

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should try to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing pairs of numbers that cancel each other out in the XOR operation.

4. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each integer \( p_i \) (where \( i \) is 1, 2, 3, or 4), the number of pairs that can be formed is \( p_i // 2 \).
   - Each pair of the same number will result in a zero XOR, which is favorable for Bob.

5. **Handling Odd Counts:**
   - If there are odd counts of some numbers, the remaining single numbers will contribute to the XOR.
   - If exactly three of the counts are odd, the remaining single numbers will result in a non-zero XOR, which is favorable for Alice. However, if we can form one more pair by removing one of these single numbers, Bob will win one more time.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the counts \( a, b, c, d \) of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It calculates the number of pairs for each count using integer division \( p_i // 2 \).
   - It adds 1 to the result if exactly three of the counts are odd, which accounts for the scenario where removing one more number can make the XOR zero.

7. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the input \( (1, 1, 1, 0) \):
     - Pairs: \( 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 0 \)
     - Odd counts: 3 (1, 1, 1)
     - Result: \( 0 + 1 = 1 \)
   - For the input \( (1, 0, 1, 2) \):
     - Pairs: \( 1 // 2 + 0 // 2 + 1 // 2 + 2 // 2 = 1 \)
     - Odd counts: 2 (1, 1)
     - Result: \( 1 + 0 = 1 \)
   - For the input \( (2, 2, 2, 0) \):
     - Pairs: \( 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3 \)
     - Odd counts: 0
     - Result: \( 3 + 0 = 3 \)
   - For the input \( (3, 3, 2, 0) \):
     - Pairs: \( 3 // 2 + 3 // 2 + 2 // 2 + 0 // 2 = 3 \)
     - Odd counts: 2 (3, 3)
     - Result: \( 3 + 0 = 3 \)
   - For the input \( (0, 9, 9, 9) \):
     - Pairs: \( 0 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 + 9 // 2 = 12 \)
     - Odd counts: 3 (9, 9, 9)
     - Result: \( 12 + 1 = 13 \)

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by forming pairs and handling the special case of exactly three odd counts.
