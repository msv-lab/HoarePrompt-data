### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Sum Calculation:**
   - The program uses the formula \( \text{sum} += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i \) to calculate the sum. This formula is derived from the difference of squares, which simplifies to \( \text{sum} += (2i - 1) * i \). However, this formula does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix.
   - For \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum is 7, but the program calculates it as 9. This is because the formula does not account for the correct sum of the permutations used in the operations.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program always assigns the same permutation to each row and column, which is not optimal. The operations should be designed to maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - For \( n = 2 \), the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum of 7 are:
     ```
     7 3
     1 1 1 2
     1 2 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - The program outputs:
     ```
     9 4
     1 2 1 2
     2 2 1 2
     1 1 1 2
     2 1 1 2
     ```
   - This output does not follow the problem description, as it does not maximize the sum correctly and uses more operations than necessary.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program iterates over each test case and calculates the sum using the incorrect formula.
   - It also confirms that the program prints the same permutation for each row and column, which is not optimal for maximizing the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for the matrix and the operations it prints are not optimal. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
