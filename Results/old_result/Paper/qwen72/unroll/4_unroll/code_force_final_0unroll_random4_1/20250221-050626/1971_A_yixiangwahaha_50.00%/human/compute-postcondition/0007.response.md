Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each of the `t` test cases, the loop prints a pair of integers for each index `i` from 0 to 9. The pair is either `x[i]` and `y[i]` if `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, or `y[i]` and `x[i]` if `x[i]` is greater than or equal to `y[i]`. The lists `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
