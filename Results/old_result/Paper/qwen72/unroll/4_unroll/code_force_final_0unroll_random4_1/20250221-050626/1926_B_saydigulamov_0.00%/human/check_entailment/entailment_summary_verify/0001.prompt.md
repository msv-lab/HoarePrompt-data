You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `a` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of rows in a grid, followed by `n` lines of input, each containing a string of characters '0' or '1'. If any of these grids contain exactly two rows with the same number of '1's, it prints a list of the counts of '1's in those rows. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is unchanged except for the side effect of printing the results to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the size of the grid, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.

2. **Shape Detection**: The program creates a list `k` to store the count of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. This is a good approach to identify the pattern of '1's in the grid.

3. **Shape Identification**: The program checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal. If they are, it prints the list `k`. This is incorrect because:
   - It does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
   - It only checks the first two elements of `k`, which is not sufficient to determine the shape. For a square, all elements of `k` should be equal. For a triangle, the elements should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...` or `5, 3, 1, ...`.

4. **Output**: The program does not produce the correct output format as specified in the problem statement. It should print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
