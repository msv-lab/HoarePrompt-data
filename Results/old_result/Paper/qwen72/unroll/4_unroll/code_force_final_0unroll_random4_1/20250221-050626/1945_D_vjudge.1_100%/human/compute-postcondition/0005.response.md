The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `suff` and `ans` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is 0; `ans` is set to positive infinity; `i` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
