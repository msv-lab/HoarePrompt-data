You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `x` from the user, which determines the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user, ensuring that both are between 0 and 9. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the last values of `x` and `y` input by the user are retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description which states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is appropriate for processing `t` test cases.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` for each test case. This is also correct as per the problem description.

4. **Condition for Minimum and Maximum**: The program checks if `x` is greater than `y` and prints `x` and `y` in that order if true. Otherwise, it prints `y` and `x`. This logic is incorrect because the problem requires the minimum of `x` and `y` to be printed first, followed by the maximum.

5. **Output**: The program should print the minimum value followed by the maximum value for each test case. However, the current logic prints the larger value first and the smaller value second, which is the opposite of what is required.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
