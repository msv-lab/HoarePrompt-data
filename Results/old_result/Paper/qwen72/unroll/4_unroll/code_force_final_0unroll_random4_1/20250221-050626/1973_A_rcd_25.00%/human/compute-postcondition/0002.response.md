Output State: **The loop will have executed t times, and for each iteration, it will have processed the input scores p1, p2, and p3, printing the appropriate result based on the conditions specified in the loop. The values of p1, p2, and p3 will be updated with each iteration, but the initial values of p_1, p_2, and p_3 provided as input to the function will remain unchanged. The number of test cases t will also remain unchanged.**
