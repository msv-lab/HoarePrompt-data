Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. `total_water` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`. `container` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `container` is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
