Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

**Where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing n, q, a list of integers a_1, ..., a_n, and a list of q queries, each query being a tuple (l, r) such that 1 <= l < r <= n. Each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30, and the sum of n and q over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
