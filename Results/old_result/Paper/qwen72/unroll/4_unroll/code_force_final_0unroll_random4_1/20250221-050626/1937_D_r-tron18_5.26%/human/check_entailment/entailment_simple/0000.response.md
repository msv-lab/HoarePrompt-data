### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s1` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to calculate the difference between the last element of the list `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - The function is used to compute the cumulative sums of indices in the `preOne` and `suffZero` lists, which are essential for determining the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is `>`.
     - `totalOne` is the count of `>` characters in the string.
     - `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums of the indices in `pre`.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store cumulative sums of indices where the character is `<`, starting from the end of the string.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, which will store the results for each query.
   - **Loop**:
     - The loop iterates from the end of the string to the beginning.
     - For each character `el` in the string:
       - If `el` is `>`, it calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the `func_1` function and updates the `ans` list.
       - It then updates the `preOne` list and decreases `totalOne`.
       - If `el` is `<`, it appends the cumulative sum of indices to `suffZero` and updates the `ans` list.
   - **Output**:
     - The results are printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the movement of the pinball based on the rules provided.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) allows for efficient calculation of the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The conditions and calculations within the loop ensure that the pinball's movement is correctly simulated and the time is accurately computed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a string with only `>` or only `<` characters.
   - The cumulative sums and the use of `func_1` ensure that the program can handle any valid input within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for simulating the pinball's movement and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid. The use of cumulative sums and the loop logic are appropriate for the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
