Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, each time reading a new value of `n` from the user. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it will print 'NO'. If `n` is even, it will print 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'A' and 'B' characters. The pattern will alternate between 'A' and 'B' and will have a length of `n`. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the last input value read. The list `pattern` will be populated with the last generated pattern if `n` was even, otherwise, it will be an empty list.**
