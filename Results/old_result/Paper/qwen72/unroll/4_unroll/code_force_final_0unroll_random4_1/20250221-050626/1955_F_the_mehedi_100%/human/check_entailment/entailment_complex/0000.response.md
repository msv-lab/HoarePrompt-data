Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Analysis**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence results in a zero XOR when combined.
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero, and the XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - The XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0 (since \(1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0\)).
   - The XOR of 4 is 4 (since \(4 \oplus 4 = 0\)).

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, removing one number from each of these counts will make the XOR zero, thus Bob wins.
   - For each count, removing pairs of numbers (i.e., \( \text{count} // 2 \)) will not change the parity of the XOR, but removing an odd number of elements will.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If so, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the integer division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The initial check for all three counts being odd is correct because it ensures that removing one number from each count will make the XOR zero.
   - The addition of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each count is correct because it counts the number of pairs that can be removed without changing the parity of the XOR.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
