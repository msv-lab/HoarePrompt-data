### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nene has an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - She can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes the matrix \( mat \) with \( n \) rows, each containing the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - It calculates the maximum sum \( res \) using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - It prints the maximum sum \( res \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it prints a Type 1 operation on row \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For each \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, it prints a Type 2 operation on column \( i \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Evaluating the Correctness:**
   - **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
     - The formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \) is used to calculate the maximum sum. This formula is derived from the fact that each element in the matrix can be at most \( n \), and the sum of all elements in the matrix can be maximized by filling each row and column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - However, the formula provided in the program is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is at most \( n \) is \( n^2 \times \frac{n + 1}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^3 + n^2}{2} \).

   - **Number of Operations:**
     - The program prints \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
     - Each operation is correctly formatted and uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

   - **Matrix Filling:**
     - The program fills the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column, which is a valid way to maximize the sum of the matrix.
     - However, the initial matrix \( mat \) is not used in the operations, so it is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly performs the operations and prints the operations in the required format.
- The number of operations is within the allowed limit.
- The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is wrong. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^3 + n^2}{2} \).
