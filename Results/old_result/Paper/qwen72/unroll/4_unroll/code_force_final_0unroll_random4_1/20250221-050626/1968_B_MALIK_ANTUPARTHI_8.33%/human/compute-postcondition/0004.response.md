Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c`, respectively. It then computes an integer `k` which represents the position in `d` where the substring of `d` up to that point is no longer a substring of the remaining part of `e`. If `d` is a substring of `e`, `k` will be the length of `d`. The function prints `k` for each test case. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any values. **
