Output State: **The loop will execute `x` times, where `x` is the input integer for each test case. During each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` will be updated based on user input. If `x` is greater than `y`, the loop will print `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it will print `y` followed by `x`. After all iterations, the values of `x` and `y` will be the last values input by the user, and the loop will have printed the results for each iteration. The variable `i` will be equal to `x - 1` at the end of the loop.**
