Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - It initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to keep track of visited disks and the coefficients for adjusting radii.
   - It also initializes an empty list `nodes` to store the indices of disks visited during each DFS call.

2. **DFS Function**:
   - The function `dfs` is called for each disk that has not been visited.
   - It marks the disk as visited and adds its index to the `nodes` list.
   - It then checks all other disks to see if they are tangent to the current disk. If they are, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on the tangent disks.
   - The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that the disks are exactly tangent, which is correct based on the problem description.

3. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.
   - The initial values for `coef0` and `coef1` are set to `0` and `1` respectively for the first disk in each connected component.
   - For each tangent disk, the coefficients are updated to ensure that the sum of radii can be adjusted without violating the tangency condition.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all disks, the function checks if there is any connected component where the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero.
   - If such a component exists, it means that it is possible to adjust the radii to strictly decrease the total sum while maintaining tangency.
   - The function prints 'YES' if such a component is found and 'NO' otherwise.

5. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where no disks are tangent to each other.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all disks are part of a single connected component.
   - The use of `coef0` and `coef1` ensures that the sum of radii can be adjusted without violating the tangency condition.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes the disks using DFS to identify connected components, and checks if the radii can be adjusted as required.

Correctness: **True**
