Output State: **For each test case, the loop will output two integers, `prev` and `v1`, which are indices in the permutation `p` such that `p[prev]` and `p[v1]` are the maximum and second maximum values in the permutation, respectively. The loop will complete all iterations for each test case, and the final values of `prev` and `v1` will be printed in the format `! prev v1` for each test case.**
