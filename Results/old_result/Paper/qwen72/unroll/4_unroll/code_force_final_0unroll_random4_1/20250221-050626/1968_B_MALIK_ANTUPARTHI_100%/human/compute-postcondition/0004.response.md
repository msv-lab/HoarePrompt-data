Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c`, followed by two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `b` and `c` respectively. The function then processes these strings to find the index `k` in string `d` up to which the characters of `d` can be found in `e` in the same order. It prints the value of `k` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` remain integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, and the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5. The input variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` are consumed and no longer available. **
