Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b - a < n` and `b > a` correctly. Specifically, the formula used in the `else` block is incorrect. Let's consider the case where `n = 10`, `a = 5`, and `b = 6`:

- According to the problem, the optimal `k` would be `1` because `b - a = 1` and `1 < 10`.
- The profit should be calculated as: `6 + 5 * 9 = 51`.

However, the program calculates the profit as:
```python
print(int((6 - 5) / 2 * (6 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 10))
```
This results in:
```python
print(int(1 / 2 * 2 + 50))
```
Which simplifies to:
```python
print(int(1 + 50))
```
And the output is `51`, which is correct in this case. However, the formula used is not general and can fail for other cases. For example, if `n = 10`, `a = 5`, and `b = 7`:

- The optimal `k` would be `2` because `b - a = 2` and `2 < 10`.
- The profit should be calculated as: `7 + 6 + 5 * 8 = 55`.

The program calculates:
```python
print(int((7 - 5) / 2 * (7 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 10))
```
This results in:
```python
print(int(2 / 2 * 3 + 50))
```
Which simplifies to:
```python
print(int(3 + 50))
```
And the output is `53`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
