The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` such that `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2` and moves to the next test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.
