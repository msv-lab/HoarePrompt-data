The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `costs`. The loop will execute if `costs` is not empty. Given the initial state, `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `n - k + 1` is a positive integer, and thus `costs` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute without any adjustments to `n`, `k`, or `costs`.

However, for the loop to start, `i` must be set to the first element of `costs`. The state of `h` does not affect the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. `i` is `n - k + 1`, `h` is 0**
