Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: The cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining yogurts (if `n` is odd) are bought at the regular price.
   - It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - If `n` is 1, it simply prints the regular price `a` since the promotional price does not apply.

The logic is correct because:
- When `n` is 1, the only option is to buy one yogurt at the regular price, so printing `a` is correct.
- When `n` is greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the cost of buying yogurts in pairs at the promotional price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price. This ensures that the minimum cost is always considered.

The program also handles the constraints correctly:
- The number of test cases `t` is within the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are within the specified ranges `[1, 100]` and `[1, 30]`.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to be correct and will produce the expected output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
