### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Set and Sorting**: The program converts the list of pile sizes into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set. This is a valid approach to identify the unique pile sizes and their order.

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes a variable `ans` to 1, which will be used to determine the winner. It also converts the sorted set into a list and prepends a 0 to it to simplify the logic for checking differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - If the number of unique pile sizes (excluding the 0) is exactly 2, the program prints 'Alice'. This is correct because if there are only two unique pile sizes, Alice can always choose the smaller size and empty all piles in one move.
   - If there are more than 2 unique pile sizes, the program iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1. If it finds such a difference, it breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, it toggles the `ans` variable using the XOR operation (`ans ^= 1`).

5. **Output**: After the loop, the program prints 'Alice' if `ans` is 1, and 'Bob' otherwise. This logic is based on the idea that if all differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are 1, the game is essentially a Nim game with all piles of the same size, which is a losing position for the first player (Alice).

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Single Unique Pile Size**: If all piles have the same size, the game is a simple Nim game where the first player can always win by removing all stones in one move. The program correctly handles this by printing 'Alice' if the number of unique pile sizes is 2 (including the 0).

- **Multiple Unique Pile Sizes**: If there are more than 2 unique pile sizes, the program checks if the differences between consecutive elements are all 1. If they are, the game is a losing position for the first player (Alice) because the second player can always mirror the first player's moves. If there is any difference greater than 1, the first player can make a move that leaves the second player in a losing position.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the unique pile sizes and their differences. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
