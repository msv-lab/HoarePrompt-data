The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sides of a polygon) and `m` (a non-negative integer such that 0 <= m <= n, representing the number of edges to be added). It returns a list `l` of `n + 1` sublists, where each sublist contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by edges. The length of each sublist can vary based on the number of edges added to each vertex. After the function concludes, `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the returned list `l` represents the adjacency list of the polygon with the added edges.
