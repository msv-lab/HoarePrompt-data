Precondition: **The function should take three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input, where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players after playing chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.** 

However, since the function definition provided does not include parameters for the scores or the number of test cases, it should be corrected to match the problem description. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def max_draws(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers (p_1, p_2, p_3).
