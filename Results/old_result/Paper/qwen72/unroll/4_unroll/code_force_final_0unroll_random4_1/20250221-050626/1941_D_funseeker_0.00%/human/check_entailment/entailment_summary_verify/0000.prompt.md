You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

#Function 1:

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on three integer variables `n`, `m`, and `x` (where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n) that are obtained from the function `func_3`. The function generates a set `ans` of all possible values derived from the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times. If `0` is present in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`. The function then prints the number of unique values in `ans` and the values themselves. The variables `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case correctly when the direction is '0' or '1' and the distance `r` is such that the player index wraps around the circle. Specifically, the program uses the modulo operation to handle the wrap-around, but it does not correctly adjust the player index when it should be wrapping around in the counterclockwise direction.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
6 1 1
3 1
```
Here, `n = 6`, `m = 1`, `x = 1`, and the first throw is a distance of 3 counterclockwise. According to the problem description, the ball should be with player 4 (since player 1 is at index 0, and moving 3 steps counterclockwise from player 1 should land on player 4). However, the program will incorrectly calculate the position as `1 - 3 % 6 = 4 % 6 = 4`, which is correct, but it does not handle the case where the player index should wrap around correctly for all possible inputs.

A correct implementation should ensure that the player index is adjusted properly for both clockwise and counterclockwise movements, especially when the index wraps around the circle. For counterclockwise movements, the correct adjustment would be `(q - r + n) % n` to ensure the index does not go negative.
