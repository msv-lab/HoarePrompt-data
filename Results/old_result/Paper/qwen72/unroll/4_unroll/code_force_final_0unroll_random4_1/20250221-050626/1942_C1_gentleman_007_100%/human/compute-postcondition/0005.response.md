To determine if the loop can execute the first time, we need to check the condition in the `while` loop head: `p <= num`. 

Given the program state:
- `num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2.
- `p` is 2.

The condition `p <= num` translates to `2 <= num`. Since `num` is already specified to be at least 2, the condition `2 <= num` will always be true for the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all of which are `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, all of which are `0`; `p` is 2**
