Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play their game optimally. The core idea is that Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Counter Usage**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning Alice will try to pick the smallest unique integer (if any) to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not unique to minimize the MEX.
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` and checks for the following conditions:
     - If the integer `i` is not in `arr`, it is the MEX, and the program prints it and breaks.
     - If the integer `i` is unique in `arr` (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1`), and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked a unique integer, so Bob will pick this one, and the program prints `i` and breaks.
     - If the integer `i` is unique in `arr` and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will pick this unique integer, and `first` is set to `True`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the MEX for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the MEX by iterating from 0 to `n` and checking if the integer is not in the array or is the first unique integer after Alice has picked a unique integer.
- The logic for setting `first` to `True` and checking for unique integers is consistent with the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each test case independently.

### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where all integers in `arr` are unique.
- The program correctly handles the case where all integers in `arr` are the same.
- The program correctly handles the case where `arr` is empty (though this is not possible given the constraints).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. It follows the problem description and constraints, and the logic for determining the MEX is sound.

Correctness: **True**
