Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Input and Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases. It reads a single string and processes it, but the problem description specifies that the input will contain multiple test cases, each with its own string. The program should read the number of test cases first and then process each string in a loop.

2. **Incorrect Partitioning Logic**: The logic for partitioning the string to ensure no substring is a palindrome is flawed. The program attempts to find the first character that is different from the first character and then checks if the remaining substring is a palindrome. This approach does not guarantee that the partition will result in non-palindromic substrings. For example, for the string "abba", the program will incorrectly partition it as "a bb a" which contains palindromic substrings.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is a single character (e.g., "a"), it should print "NO" because a single character is a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. The program does not account for this scenario.

4. **Output Format**: The output format for the partitioned substrings is incorrect. The substrings should be printed without spaces between them, as specified in the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def partition_string(s):
    if not is_palindrome(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not is_palindrome(s[:i]) and not is_palindrome(s[i:]):
            print('YES')
            print(2)
            print(s[:i], s[i:])
            return
    print('NO')

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        partition_string(s)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_palindrome Function**: This function checks if a given string is a palindrome.
2. **partition_string Function**: This function checks if the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. If the entire string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself. Otherwise, it tries to find a valid partition by checking all possible splits of the string.
3. **main Function**: This function reads the number of test cases and processes each string using the `partition_string` function.

This corrected program should handle all the cases as specified in the problem description.
