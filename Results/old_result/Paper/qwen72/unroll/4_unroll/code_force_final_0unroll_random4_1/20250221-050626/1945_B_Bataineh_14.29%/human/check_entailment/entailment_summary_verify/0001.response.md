### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` which represent the launch intervals of the two installations and the visibility duration of each firework, respectively.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`. If this condition is true, it prints `2`.
     - This is correct because if the visibility duration `m` is less than the launch interval of either installation, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 2. This is because each installation can launch a firework at most once within the visibility duration of the other firework, and both fireworks will be visible for at least one minute.

3. **Calculation**:
   - If `m` is not less than either `a` or `b`, the program calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`.
     - This formula is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the points where both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
     - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` simply counts the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` and adds 2 for the initial launches, but it does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched at the same time by both installations.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks launched at different times.
- The correct formula to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is:
  - `max(1 + (m // a) + (m // b) - (m // lcm(a, b)), 2)`
  - `1 + (m // a) + (m // b)` counts the total number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility duration `m`.
  - `(m // lcm(a, b))` subtracts the number of times both installations launch fireworks simultaneously to avoid double-counting.
  - The `max` function ensures that the result is at least 2, as the minimum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2.

### Conclusion:
- The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap of fireworks launched by both installations.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
