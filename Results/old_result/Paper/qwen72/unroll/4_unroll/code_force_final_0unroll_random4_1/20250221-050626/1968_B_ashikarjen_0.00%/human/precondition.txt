t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of binary strings a and b, respectively. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
