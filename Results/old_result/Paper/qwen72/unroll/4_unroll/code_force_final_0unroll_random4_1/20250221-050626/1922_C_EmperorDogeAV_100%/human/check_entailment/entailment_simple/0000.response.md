### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The city coordinates are stored in a list `cities` and are guaranteed to be in strictly ascending order.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the next city is closer than the previous city, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating that the closest city is the next one).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the current city and the previous city (indicating that the closest city is the previous one).

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the forward and backward closest city distances.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum of `forward_cities`.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum of `backward_cities`, but since `backward_cities` is calculated on the reversed `cities` list, it is also reversed to align with the original order.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the source city `a` and the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it calculates the minimum cost using the forward prefix sum.
   - If `a > b`, it calculates the minimum cost using the backward prefix sum.
   - The cost is calculated by subtracting the prefix sums at the appropriate indices.

### Issues:
- **Closest City Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` has a logical error in the way it calculates the closest city. Specifically, the condition `if i < n - 1: forward = cities[i + 1]` is incorrect because it should be `if i < n - 2: forward = cities[i + 1]` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.
  - Additionally, the condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` should be `if abs(forward - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - back):` to ensure that the closest city is determined uniquely, as per the problem statement.

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum calculation is correct, but it relies on the incorrect output from `func_1`.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The query handling logic is correct, but it will produce incorrect results due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    
    return prog_cities
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in the `func_1` function that affects the correctness of the closest city determination. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
