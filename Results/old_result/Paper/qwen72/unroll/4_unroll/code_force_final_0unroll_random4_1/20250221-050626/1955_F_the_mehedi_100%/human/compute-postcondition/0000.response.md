The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the range function. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` and the values of `p_i` do not directly affect the loop's execution, but they must remain as specified to ensure the context of the program is correct.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and for each test case, `p_i` are integers such that 0 <= `p_i` <= 200, representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence, respectively.**
