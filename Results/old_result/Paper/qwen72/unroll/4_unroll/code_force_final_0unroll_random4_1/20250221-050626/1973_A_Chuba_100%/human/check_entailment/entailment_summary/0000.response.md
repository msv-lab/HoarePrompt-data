Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the maximum number of draws that could have occurred in a series of chess games between three friends based on their final scores. The key points to consider are:

1. **Sum of Scores**: The total sum of the scores must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (in case of a win/loss) or 2 points (in case of a draw). If the sum is odd, it's impossible to achieve the scores, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

2. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2`. This formula is derived from the following logic:
   - The total number of points distributed in the games is `p_1 + p_2 + p_3`.
   - The maximum number of points that could be distributed without any draws is `2 * (number of games)`, where each game results in 2 points (one for the winner and one for the loser).
   - The term `max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)` accounts for the scenario where the highest score `p_3` is greater than the sum of the other two scores. This difference represents the points that must have been earned through wins, not draws.
   - Subtracting this difference from the total points gives the maximum points that could have been distributed through draws.
   - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all scores are zero, the program correctly prints `0` (no games played).
   - If the scores are such that `p_3` is significantly higher than `p_1` and `p_2`, the program correctly handles the scenario by ensuring that the number of draws is calculated correctly.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is `0` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `0`.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `1`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is `3` (odd), and the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is `4` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is `9` (odd), and the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `6`.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2`.

The program handles all these cases correctly and follows the logic described in the problem statement.
