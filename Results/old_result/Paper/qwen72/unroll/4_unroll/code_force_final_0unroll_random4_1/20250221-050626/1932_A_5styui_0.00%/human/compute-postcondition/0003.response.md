Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is an input integer, the list of tuples is unchanged, `s` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so it remains an integer between 1 and 1000.
- The variable `a` is the number of iterations the outer loop will run, and it is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same input integer.
- The list of tuples is not mentioned in the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- The variable `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, so after the loop finishes, `s` will be 0.
