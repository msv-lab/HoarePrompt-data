Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of `x` integers. It then checks if for any index `i` in the range 0 to `x-1`, the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` holds true. If the condition is met, it prints 2 and breaks out of the inner loop. If the condition is never met, it prints 3. The function does not return any value and does not modify any input parameters or global variables. **
