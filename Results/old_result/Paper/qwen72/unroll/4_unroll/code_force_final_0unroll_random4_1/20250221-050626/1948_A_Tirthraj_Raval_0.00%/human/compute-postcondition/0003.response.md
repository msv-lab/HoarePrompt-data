The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 50. `n` is an integer representing the length of the string to be generated, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each test case, the function returns a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. If no such string can be constructed, the function returns "NO".
