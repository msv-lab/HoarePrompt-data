**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - `func_1` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This function is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_4` reads the game parameters and the throw details for each test case.

2. **Game Simulation:**
   - `func_4` initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It then iterates `m` times, each time reading a throw distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each player in the set `ans`, it calculates the new positions if the throw is made clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the new position `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the new position `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to the temporary set `temp`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `0` is present in the set `ans` after all throws, it is replaced by `n` because player `0` is the same as player `n` in a circular arrangement.
   - The function then prints the number of unique players in `ans` and the players themselves in increasing order.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the circular nature of the game by using modulo operations.
   - It correctly accounts for both possible directions when the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`).
   - The function ensures that the final set of players is unique and in the correct range (1 to `n`).

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly implement the game logic and handle all specified cases.

**Correctness: True**
