The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 <= t <= 500. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers representing the scores of the three players after all the games, with the constraint that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns the result of the game for each test case based on the scores of the players.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30) representing the scores of the three players. The function returns the result of the game for each test case based on the scores provided.**
