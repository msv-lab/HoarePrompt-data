Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calculates the total number of tents needed for all participants.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each introvert needs a separate tent) to the result from `func_1`.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases:
- It ensures that each introvert gets a separate tent.
- It checks if the extroverts can be accommodated in groups of 3, using universals if necessary.
- It returns -1 if it's impossible to form groups of 3 for the extroverts.

The example test cases provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
