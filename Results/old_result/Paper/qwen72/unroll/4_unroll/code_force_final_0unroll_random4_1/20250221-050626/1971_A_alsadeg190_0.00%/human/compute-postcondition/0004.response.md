Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It first reads an integer `x` from the user, which determines the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the user, ensuring that both are between 0 and 9. It then prints the two integers in ascending order. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the last values of `x` and `y` input by the user are retained. **
