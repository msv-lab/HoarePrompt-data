### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum `res` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This formula is incorrect for the problem at hand.
   - For a 2x2 matrix (n=2), the correct maximum sum is 7, as shown in the example. However, the program calculates `res` as `1 * 3 + 2 * 5 = 3 + 10 = 13`, which is clearly incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs `2n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each `i` from `n` to 1, it prints:
     - A Type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - A Type 2 operation on column `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - These operations do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. For example, for a 2x2 matrix, the operations will result in the matrix:
     ```
     1 2
     2 1
     ```
     The sum of this matrix is 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6, which is not the maximum possible sum of 7.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum of the matrix, you should use permutations that ensure the highest possible values are placed in the matrix.
   - For a 2x2 matrix, the correct operations to achieve the maximum sum of 7 are:
     - Type 1 operation on row 1: `1 1 1 2`
     - Type 1 operation on row 2: `1 2 1 2`
     - Type 2 operation on column 1: `2 1 1 2`
   - This will result in the matrix:
     ```
     1 2
     2 1
     ```
     which has a sum of 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6, but the correct maximum sum is 7.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for every potential case. The sum calculation and the operations performed are incorrect and do not align with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
