The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 100, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 100; and `k`, which is an integer between 2 and 100. The function returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and each value is the frequency of the corresponding integer in `arr`, but the frequency is capped at a maximum of `k`. The original values in `arr` and the value of `k` remain unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and each value is the frequency of the corresponding integer in `arr`, capped at a maximum of `k`.**
