The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It calculates a series of values based on the sum of the elements in the list, adjusting for the removal of the last `removals` elements and the sum of the last `negatives` elements. The function returns the maximum value from this series. The final state of the program is that `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, `elements` is not modified, and the returned value is the maximum of the calculated series.
