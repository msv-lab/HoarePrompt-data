The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, and `x` and `y` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, with both `x` and `y` consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the example. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept three parameters `t`, `x`, and `y` and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 10^100, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
