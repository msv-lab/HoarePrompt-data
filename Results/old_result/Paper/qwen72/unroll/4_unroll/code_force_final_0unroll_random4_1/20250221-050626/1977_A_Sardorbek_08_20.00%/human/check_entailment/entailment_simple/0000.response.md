Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining if after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. The logic in the program, however, has a few issues:

1. **Variable Names and Function Signature**: The function `func` should take no parameters, but the problem description suggests that the function should process input directly. This is not a correctness issue per se, but it is worth noting for clarity.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then processes each test case by reading `b` and `c` (which correspond to `n` and `m` in the problem description).

3. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The first condition `if b == c:` correctly prints "YES" if `n` is equal to `m`. This is correct because if the number of moves is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes, Nikita can simply add one cube per move.
   - The second condition `elif b < c:` correctly prints "NO" if `n` is less than `m`. This is correct because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - The third condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, not the number of moves `n`. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`. This is because the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and `m` must match for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. If `n` and `m` have the same parity, it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes by alternating between adding and removing cubes in a way that the final count matches `m`.

4. **Final Condition**: The `else` block correctly prints "No" if the parity of `n` and `m` does not match.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect because it uses the wrong variable in the parity check condition.

Correctness: **False**
