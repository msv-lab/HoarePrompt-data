The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters, where `n` has the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The string consists of characters '.', '@', or '*', and the first character of each string is always '.'.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if the path represented by the string is valid based on some criteria (not specified in the constraints but implied by the function's output).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters starting with '.'. It returns a list of results, each indicating whether the corresponding path is valid.**
