Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, the value of `res` is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and the value of `n << 1` is 2 * n. Additionally, for each test case, the loop prints two lines for each i from n to 1: the first line is "1 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to n, and the second line is "2 i" followed by the numbers from 1 to n. The initial state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, but the loop has been executed for each test case.**
