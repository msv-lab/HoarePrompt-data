The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. `n` represents the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` represents the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates whether it is possible to color the cells of the square grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. If it is possible, the function returns "Possible" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "Not Possible".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. It returns a list of strings, where each string is "Possible" if it is feasible to color the cells of a square grid of size `n` such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell, or "Not Possible" otherwise.**
