The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers, with the constraint that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns a value based on these inputs.**
