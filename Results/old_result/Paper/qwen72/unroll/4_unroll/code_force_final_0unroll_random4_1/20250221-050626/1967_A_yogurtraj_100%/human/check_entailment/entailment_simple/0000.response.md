### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `k`, and then reads the list `a` of integers representing the number of cards of each type.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows us to efficiently determine how to distribute the `k` coins to maximize the score.

3. **Initial Setup**: The variable `r` is initialized to the smallest number of cards of any type (`a[0]`). This is the starting point for our calculations.

4. **Main Loop**: The loop iterates through the sorted list `a` to determine the optimal way to distribute the `k` coins:
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-2`, it checks if the difference between `a[i+1]` and `a[i]` multiplied by `i+1` exceeds the remaining `k` coins.
   - If it does, it calculates the maximum number of cards of type `i+1` that can be bought with the remaining `k` coins and updates `r` and `rem` accordingly.
   - If it doesn't, it subtracts the cost of making all types from `a[i]` to `a[i+1]` equal and updates `r` to `a[i+1]`.

5. **Final Calculation**: After the loop, if `k` is still non-zero, it means we can still buy more cards. The final score is calculated by adding the number of complete permutations of length `n` that can be formed with the remaining coins and the initial score.

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum score that can be achieved.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `k` is 0, the function correctly calculates the score based on the initial distribution of cards.
  - When `k` is large enough to buy cards for all types, the function correctly calculates the maximum score.

- **Logic**:
  - The sorting step ensures that we can incrementally increase the number of cards for each type, which is necessary to maximize the score.
  - The loop correctly handles the distribution of coins to balance the number of cards of each type.
  - The final calculation accounts for any remaining coins and ensures that the score is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the algorithm is sound for maximizing the score.
