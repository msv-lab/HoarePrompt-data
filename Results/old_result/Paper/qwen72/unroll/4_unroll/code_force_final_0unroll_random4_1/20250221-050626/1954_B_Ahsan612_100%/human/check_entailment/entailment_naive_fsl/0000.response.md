Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful but does not consist of identical elements. Specifically, the logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the `num` and `i` variables, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a counterexample:
```
Input:
4
3
1 2 1
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Expected Output:
1
1
-1
3

Actual Output:
1
1
-1
1
```

In the fourth test case, the program outputs `1` instead of `3`. The correct output should be `3` because removing the first three elements results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful. The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is not correctly implemented, leading to this incorrect result.
