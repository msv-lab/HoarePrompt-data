### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Nene has an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - She can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
   - This formula simplifies to \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i \), which further simplifies to \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).
   - The correct formula for the sum should be \( \text{sum} = n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Operations:**
   - The program outputs \( n + n \) operations, which is \( 2n \) operations.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - Each operation uses the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is correct for maximizing the sum.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The operations are correct and will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in both rows and columns.
   - The number of operations is within the limit of \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the sum calculation is wrong. The correct sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), not the sum calculated by the program. The operations are correct and will achieve the maximum sum, but the output sum is incorrect.

Final: **False**
