### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The function checks if both `a` and `b` are odd using the condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`. If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'NO' because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides that can form a different rectangle.

3. **Exact Half Check**: The function also checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other using the conditions `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If this condition is met, it prints 'NO' because the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when combined, just rotated.

4. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints 'YES'. This is because if at least one dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle in such a way that the resulting pieces can form a different rectangle.

5. **Output Case Sensitivity**: The problem description states that the output can be in any case (upper or lower). The function prints 'NO' and 'YES' in uppercase, which is acceptable.

6. **Test Cases**: The function should correctly handle the provided test cases:
   - For `1 1`, both dimensions are odd, so it prints 'NO'.
   - For `2 1`, one dimension is odd, so it prints 'NO'.
   - For `2 6`, one dimension is even, so it prints 'YES'.
   - For `3 2`, one dimension is even, so it prints 'YES'.
   - For `2 2`, one dimension is even, so it prints 'YES'.
   - For `2 4`, one dimension is even, so it prints 'YES'.
   - For `6 3`, one dimension is even, so it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given dimensions. It handles all the edge cases and test cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
