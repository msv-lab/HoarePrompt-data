The function `func_1` accepts a list of city positions `cities` and an integer `n`, and returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the closest neighboring city for each city in the input list, except the last city. If the city immediately after a given city is closer than the city immediately before it, the value is 1; otherwise, the value is the absolute difference between the city at index `i` and the city immediately before it. The final state of the program is that `prog_cities` contains these calculated distances.
