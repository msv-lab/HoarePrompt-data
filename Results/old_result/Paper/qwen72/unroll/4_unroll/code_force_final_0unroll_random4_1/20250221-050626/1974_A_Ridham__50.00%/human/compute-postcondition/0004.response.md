To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case.
- The length of `result` is equal to `n`.
- Each element in `result` corresponds to the number of screens required for the respective test case.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`result` List**: The `result` list contains integers, where each integer represents the number of screens required for a specific test case.
2. **`map(str, result)`**: This part of the code converts each element in the `result` list to a string. For example, if `result` is `[10, 20, 30]`, `map(str, result)` will produce an iterable that contains `['10', '20', '30']`.
3. **`'\n'.join(map(str, result))`**: This part of the code joins the string representations of the elements in the `result` list with a newline character (`\n`). For example, if `result` is `[10, 20, 30]`, `'\n'.join(map(str, result))` will produce the string `10\n20\n30`.
4. **`print` Statement**: The `print` statement will output the joined string, which means each element of the `result` list will be printed on a new line.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Since the exact values of the elements in `result` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each element is the number of screens required for the respective test case)**
