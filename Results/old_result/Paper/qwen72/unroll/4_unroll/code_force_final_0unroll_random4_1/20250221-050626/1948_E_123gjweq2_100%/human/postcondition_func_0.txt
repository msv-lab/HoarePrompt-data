The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2n, inclusive. It divides the integer `n` into `ceil(n / k)` segments, each of length `k` (or the remaining elements if the last segment is shorter), and fills each segment in the list `arr` with a unique integer starting from 1. The function prints the list `arr` where each segment is filled as described, the number of segments `cliques`, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.
