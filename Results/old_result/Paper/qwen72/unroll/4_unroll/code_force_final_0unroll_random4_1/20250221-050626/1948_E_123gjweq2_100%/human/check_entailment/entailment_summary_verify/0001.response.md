### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - An edge is added between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to print the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - It also uses a helper function `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the minimum number of cliques needed. The idea is to divide the vertices into groups of size at most k, which is a reasonable approach.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` iterates over each clique.
   - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: This function call is intended to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the current clique. The parameters are:
     - `left`: The starting index of the current clique.
     - `right`: The ending index of the current clique.
     - `clique`: The clique number.

4. **Function `make_array` Analysis:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables are used to determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the range of values.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements that are not in the midpoint range.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Checking the Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) should be satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that within each clique, the difference \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized, which helps in forming cliques.
   - However, the assignment of values in `make_array` is not optimal for ensuring the edge condition is always satisfied. Specifically, the values assigned to vertices within a clique are not necessarily in a way that minimizes \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \).

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

7. **Potential Issues:**
   - The assignment of values in `make_array` does not guarantee that the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is always satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - For example, if `k` is small, the values assigned might not form a valid clique. Consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 2`. The function `make_array` might assign values in a way that does not satisfy the edge condition for all pairs within a clique.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not always ensure that the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique. Therefore, the solution is not correct for all inputs.

### Correctness:
**False**
