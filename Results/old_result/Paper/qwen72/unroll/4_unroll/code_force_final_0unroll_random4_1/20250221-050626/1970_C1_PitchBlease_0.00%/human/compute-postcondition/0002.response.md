The loop head only contains the variable `queue`. The loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. Given that the state right before the loop indicates `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, the `queue` is already non-empty.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, the tree is represented as a dictionary or adjacency list, and `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`**
