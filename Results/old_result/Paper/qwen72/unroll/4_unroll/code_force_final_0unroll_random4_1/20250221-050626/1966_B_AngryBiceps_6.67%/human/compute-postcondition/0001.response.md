Output State: **The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'NO' if the first row of the grid is entirely one color ('W' or 'B') and different from the last row, or if the first column of the grid is entirely one color and different from the last column. Otherwise, it will have printed 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will be reset for each test case, and their values will not persist between test cases.**
