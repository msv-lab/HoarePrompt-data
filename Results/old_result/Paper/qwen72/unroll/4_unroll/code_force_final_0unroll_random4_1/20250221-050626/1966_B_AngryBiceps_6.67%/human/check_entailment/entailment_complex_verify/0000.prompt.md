You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

            print('YES')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.

            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'NO' if the first row of the grid is entirely one color ('W' or 'B') and different from the last row, or if the first column of the grid is entirely one color and different from the last column. Otherwise, it will have printed 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will be reset for each test case, and their values will not persist between test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case describes a grid of 'W' and 'B' characters. For each test case, it checks if the first row is entirely one color ('W' or 'B') and different from the last row, or if the first column is entirely one color and different from the last column. If either of these conditions is met, the function prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each one. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and their values do not persist between test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility that the grid can be made uniform even if the first and last rows or the first and last columns do not match. The logic in the program only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
BWW
WBB
WWB
```
The program will output "NO" for this grid because the first and last rows do not match, and the first and last columns do not match. However, it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color with the following operations:
1. Select (1, 1) and (3, 3) to color the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) black.
2. Select (1, 2) and (2, 3) to color the subrectangle from (1, 2) to (2, 3) white.
3. Select (1, 1) and (3, 3) again to color the entire grid black.

Thus, the correct output for this case should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
