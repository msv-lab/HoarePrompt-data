The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the function definition, but based on the parameter constraints provided, it is clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves three integers: `a`, `b`, and `m`, where `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`. The function also accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, with the constraint `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. However, given the nature of the parameters, it is reasonable to infer that the function might be performing some arithmetic or logical operation involving `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (where `1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18`). The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the given constraints.**
