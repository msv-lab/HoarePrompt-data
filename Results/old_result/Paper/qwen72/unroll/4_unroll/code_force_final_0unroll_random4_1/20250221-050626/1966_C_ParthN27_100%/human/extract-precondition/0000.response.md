Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5. Each integer a_i in the inner list is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the input parameters as described in the problem. Here's a more accurate function definition:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of lists, each containing the integers for a specific test case.
