### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even. This is correct because each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it is a draw), and thus the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have gained from winning games against the other two players. If `v[2]` is less than or equal to `v[0] + v[1]`, this term is 0.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total score gives the number of points that could have been distributed as draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, since each draw results in 2 points being distributed.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total score: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
   - `max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{0 - 0}{2} = 0\)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total score: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
   - `max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
   - `max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total score: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total score: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
   - `max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6\)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
   - `max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = 8`
   - Result: \(\frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Additional Considerations:
- The program correctly handles the case where the total score is odd by printing `-1`.
- The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is derived from the constraints of the problem and appears to be logically sound.
- The program does not modify the input values, which is consistent with the function summary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
