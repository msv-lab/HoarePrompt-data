You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

The loop has printed either 2 or 3 for each test case, depending on whether a pair (i, p) was found such that l[p - 1] == i + 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Monocarp has `n` friends, each with a best friend.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It initializes two variables: `i` (to iterate through the list) and `j` (to check if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found).
   - It iterates through the list `l` to find a pair of friends where `p_i` is the best friend of `i` and `i` is the best friend of `p_i`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` for such cases.
   - However, the program does not handle cases where there are no pairs of friends who are each other's best friends but still need to send the minimum number of invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - The program always prints `3` if no such pair is found, which is not always the correct answer. For example, if the best friends form a cycle of length greater than 2, the minimum number of invitations needed could be different.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
     - The program correctly identifies the pair (4, 5) and prints `2`.
   - **Test Case 2**: `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
     - The program does not find a pair and prints `3`, which is correct in this case because the minimum number of invitations needed is indeed `3`.
   - **Test Case 3**: `p = [2, 1]`
     - The program correctly identifies the pair (1, 2) and prints `2`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program fails to handle cases where the best friends form a cycle of length greater than 2. For example, if `p = [2, 3, 1]`, the program will print `3`, but the correct answer is `2` because inviting any two friends in the cycle will ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is not correct for all cases. It fails to handle cycles of length greater than 2 and always prints `3` in such cases, which is not always the minimum number of invitations needed.

Correctness: **False**
