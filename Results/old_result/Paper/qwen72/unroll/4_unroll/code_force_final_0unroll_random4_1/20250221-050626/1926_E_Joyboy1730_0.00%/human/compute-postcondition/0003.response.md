The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function is expected to process these test cases and return a result for each one. The exact nature of the output is not specified in the constraints, but it is clear that the function must handle a series of test cases with the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and returns a result for each test case.**
