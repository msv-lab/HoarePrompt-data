The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with the constraints 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30. For each test case, if `n` is greater than 1, the function calculates two values: `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n` is 1, the function prints `a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values.
