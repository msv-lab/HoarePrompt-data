Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of t lists, where each inner list contains two elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def min_operations(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list of cell states.
