Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of extra screens required for 1x1 icons is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
15 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, there is 1 application with a 2x2 icon, which requires 1 screen. The remaining cells on this screen can accommodate 11 of the 15 applications with 1x1 icons. The remaining 4 applications with 1x1 icons can fit into the next screen, which means the total number of screens required is 2. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of extra screens needed for the 1x1 icons, leading to an output of 3 screens.
