### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar` itself.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - The function initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity (`inf`).
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the current element.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.

3. **Output:**
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` because it means the array is either empty or consists of a single segment of the same number, which cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum length of a segment that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

### Analysis:

- **Case 1: Array with all elements the same (e.g., [2, 2, 2])**
  - The function will set `minn` to the length of the array, which is 3.
  - Since `minn` is equal to the length of the array, it will print `-1`, which is correct because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

- **Case 2: Array with alternating elements (e.g., [1, 2, 1, 2, 1])**
  - The function will find segments of length 1 for each different element.
  - It will set `minn` to 1, which is the minimum segment length.
  - The function will print 1, which is correct because removing one element (e.g., the last 1) will make the array non-beautiful.

- **Case 3: Single-element array (e.g., [1])**
  - The function will set `minn` to 1.
  - Since `minn` is equal to the length of the array, it will print `-1`, which is correct because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful.

- **Case 4: Array with multiple segments (e.g., [3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3])**
  - The function will find segments of length 3 for the first and last 3s, and a segment of length 1 for the 5.
  - It will set `minn` to 1, which is the minimum segment length.
  - The function will print 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3 because removing the first three elements (or the last three elements) will make the array non-beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly handle the case where the array has multiple segments of the same number, and the minimum segment length is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful, which is 3 in the fourth test case.

### Correctness:
**False**
