You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        a = input()
        b = input()
        kq1 = ''
        kq2 = ''
        vt = 0
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                (x, y) = (min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i])))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    if a[i] > b[i]:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        print(kq1)
        print(kq2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where each string consists of digits from 1 to 9. The function then compares the digits of `a` and `b` at each position. If the digits are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits are different, the first difference encountered results in the smaller digit being added to `kq1` and the larger digit to `kq2`, and for all subsequent differences, the larger digit is added to `kq1` and the smaller digit to `kq2`. After processing each test case, the function prints the two resulting strings `kq1` and `kq2`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not always maximize the product of \( x \) and \( y \). Specifically, the logic for swapping digits is flawed. The program only swaps the digits in \( x \) and \( y \) if they are different, and it does so in a way that tries to make the first number \( x \) as large as possible and the second number \( y \) as small as possible. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the product \( x \times y \).

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
1234
5678
```

The program will output:
```
5234
1678
```

However, the optimal solution to maximize the product would be:
```
5238
1674
```

The product of \( 5234 \times 1678 \) is 8,785,652, whereas the product of \( 5238 \times 1674 \) is 8,787,812, which is larger. Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct result.
