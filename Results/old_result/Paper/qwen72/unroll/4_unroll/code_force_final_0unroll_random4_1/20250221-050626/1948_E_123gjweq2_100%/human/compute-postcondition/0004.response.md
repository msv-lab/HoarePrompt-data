To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions that must be met for the loop to run.

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for i in range(mid):
```
This means the loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will iterate from 0 to `mid - 1`.

### Initial State
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
- `clique` is a positive integer.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.

### Conditions for Loop Execution
- The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0.
- `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`.

### Adjustments Needed
- For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, so `right - left` must be greater than 0.
- This implies `right` must be greater than `left`.

### Final State
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0 (the starting point of the loop).

### Conclusion
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `right` is greater than `left` so that `mid` is greater than 0, allowing the loop to execute.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `i` is 0, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0**
