Output State: **The loop will update the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for all disks `j` that have not been visited and whose centers are exactly at a distance equal to the sum of their radii and the radius of the initially visited disk `i`. The `visited` list and `nodes` list will also be updated to reflect the new disks that have been visited and added to `nodes` through the `dfs` function calls. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged.**
