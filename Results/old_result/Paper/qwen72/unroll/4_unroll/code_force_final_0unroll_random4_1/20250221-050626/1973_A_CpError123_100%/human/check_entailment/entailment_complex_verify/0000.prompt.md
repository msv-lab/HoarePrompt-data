You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        
        y = a + b
        
        print(min(x, y))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed either `-1` if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, or the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b` if the sum is even. The values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases, each consisting of three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that `0 <= a <= b <= c <= 30`. For each test case, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, the function prints `-1`. If the sum is even, the function prints the minimum of `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified and remain as they were read from the input.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly determine the maximum number of draws in some scenarios. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `1`

In this case, the scores `1 1 2` can be achieved with 2 draws. The first and second players could have played two games that both ended in draws, giving them 1 point each, and the third player could have played no games, thus having 2 points from a previous game. However, the program outputs `1`, which is incorrect. 

The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the maximum number of draws. The program calculates `x` as half the total points and `y` as the sum of the points of the two lowest scoring players, and then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This approach does not always correctly account for the maximum number of draws that could have occurred.
