The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` starts at 1 for the first iteration. The other variables (`s`, `x`, and the result of `func_1(s[0:])`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True, `i` is 1**
