Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates a value `ans` by adding `n` to the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each integer `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The function prints the final value of `ans` and does not return any value. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
