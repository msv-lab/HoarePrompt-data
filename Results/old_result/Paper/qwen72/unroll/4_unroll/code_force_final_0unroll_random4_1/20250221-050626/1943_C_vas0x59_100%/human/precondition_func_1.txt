No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from stdin, where the first line is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3) representing the number of vertices in the tree. The following n - 1 lines contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v) representing the edges of the tree.
