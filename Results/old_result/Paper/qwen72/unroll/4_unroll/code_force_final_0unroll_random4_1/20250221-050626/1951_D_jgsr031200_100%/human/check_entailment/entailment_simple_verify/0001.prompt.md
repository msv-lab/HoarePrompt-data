You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice does not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels. This is also correct.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - The first value `n - k + 1` is intended to be the price of the first stall, such that Alice can buy exactly one jewel from this stall.
   - The second value `1` is intended to be the price of the second stall, such that Alice can buy the remaining `k - 1` jewels from this stall.

4. **Greedy Buying**:
   - The program then iterates over the `costs` list and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - It updates `h` with the total number of jewels bought and `n` with the remaining coins after buying from each stall.

5. **Final Check**:
   - If the total number of jewels bought `h` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy the required number of jewels.
   - If `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints "YES" and outputs the number of stalls and their prices.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program assumes that setting up two stalls with prices `n - k + 1` and `1` will always allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. This is not always true.
   - For example, if `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the program sets up stalls with prices `5` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 6 jewels from the second stall, which is more than `k`.

2. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The program always prints 2 stalls, which is not always the correct number of stalls needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program sets up stalls with prices `248` and `1`. Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall and 254 jewels from the second stall, which is more than `k`.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, as she will buy one jewel from each stall until she has bought `k` jewels.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(str(1) for _ in range(k)))
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not always ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The corrected program, as shown above, correctly handles the problem by setting up `k` stalls, each with a price of `1` coin.
