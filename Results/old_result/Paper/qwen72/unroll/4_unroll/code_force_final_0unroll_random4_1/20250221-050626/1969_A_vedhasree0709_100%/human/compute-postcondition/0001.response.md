Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of integers of length n where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop has printed either 2 or 3 for each test case, depending on whether a pair (i, p) was found such that l[p - 1] == i + 1.**
