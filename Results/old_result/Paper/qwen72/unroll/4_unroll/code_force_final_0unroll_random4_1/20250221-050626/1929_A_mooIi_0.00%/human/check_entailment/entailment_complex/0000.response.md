Reasoning:  
The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after the array is rearranged to maximize this sum. However, the program sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not the required output. The program should instead calculate and print the maximum beauty value for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
