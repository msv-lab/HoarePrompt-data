Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is an odd number. When `n` is odd, the permutation generated by the program may still contain pairs of indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`:
- The program generates the permutation `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
- Here, `p_1 = 5` and `p_3 = 4` are not divisible, but `p_2 = 1` and `p_4 = 2` are divisible, and `p_3 = 4` and `p_5 = 3` are not divisible. However, the condition `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` is not strictly avoided in all cases.

To ensure the permutation is valid for all `n`, a more robust approach is needed. One possible correct approach is to alternate between the largest and smallest numbers, which ensures that no two consecutive numbers can both be divisors of two other consecutive numbers. For example, for `n = 5`, a valid permutation would be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]` or `[3, 1, 5, 2, 4]`.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
