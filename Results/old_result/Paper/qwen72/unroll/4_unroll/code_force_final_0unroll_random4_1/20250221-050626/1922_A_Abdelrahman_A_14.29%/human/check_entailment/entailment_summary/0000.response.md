Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the string `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. However, this approach does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Condition for 'NO'**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and immediately prints 'NO' if this condition is true. This is correct because if `c` is identical to either `a` or `b`, it cannot fail to match the template.
   - However, the program then checks if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES'. This is incorrect because the presence of a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b` does not guarantee that `c` will not match the template. The template must be constructed such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not.

2. **Template Construction**:
   - The program does not construct the template `t` and check if `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not. Instead, it relies on a simple character presence check, which is not sufficient to determine the correct template.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not, the program should:
     - For each position `i` from 1 to `n`, check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. If they are, the template `t[i]` must be the same as `a[i]` (and `b[i]`).
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template `t[i]` can be any uppercase letter that is not the same as `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, check if `c[i]` matches the template `t[i]` based on the rules provided. If `c[i]` matches `t[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the answer should be 'NO'.
     - If `c` does not match the template at any position, the answer should be 'YES'.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
