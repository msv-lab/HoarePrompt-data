The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The values of `n`, `m`, and the string `a` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
