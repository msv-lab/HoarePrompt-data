The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided context, it seems to operate on predefined variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`. The function is expected to return a value based on these variables, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Given the constraints:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers where len(x) == len(y) == len(r) == n, and for each i, -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 and 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9.
- `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are lists of boolean and integer values, respectively, with len(visited) == len(coef0) == len(coef1) == n.
- `nodes` is an empty list.

Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function likely processes these lists and returns a result based on the data provided.

Functionality: **The function processes predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` based on the integer `n`, and returns a result based on the processing of these lists.**
