You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of s such that 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the string input by the user)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6), `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` is True.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` if such a character exists, otherwise `x` remains -1.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: aaab bbccc
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement will always print the string 'NO' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`.
            #
            #Therefore, based on the given precondition and the code snippet, the output will be:
            #
            #Output:
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: [s[:x + 2]] [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end)
        #State: `s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1, and the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`. Additionally, if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
    #State: *`s` is the same string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `False`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`, the substring `s[x + 1:]` satisfies the condition, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, this condition is retained. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
