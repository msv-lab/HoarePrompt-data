### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are adjusted by subtracting 1 from each (to work with 0-based indexing) and sorted.
   - A set `present` is created to keep track of the chosen vertices.
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `x - 2`, which is a reasonable starting point for the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices.

3. **First Loop**:
   - The program iterates over the chosen vertices and checks if the next vertex `(a[i] + 1) % n` is not in the set `present` and the vertex after that `(a[i] + 2) % n` is in the set `present`.
   - If both conditions are met, it increments `ans` by 1. This step is correct because it identifies potential vertices that can form a triangle with the current vertex and the next chosen vertex.

4. **Gap Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices, considering the list as circular.
   - These gaps are stored in a list `gaps`.

5. **Gap Processing**:
   - The gaps are sorted.
   - The program then iterates over the gaps and checks if `y` is greater than or equal to half the gap.
   - If `y` is sufficient, it adds the gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by half the gap.
   - If `y` is insufficient, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and breaks the loop.

6. **Output**:
   - The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

### Issues and Considerations:
- **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. It should take `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices as parameters.
- **Gap Calculation**: The gap calculation should consider the circular nature of the polygon correctly. The current implementation might not handle the last gap properly if the vertices are not contiguous.
- **Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment in the gap processing loop should be carefully reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the remaining `y` values.

### Correctness:
- **True**: The program's logic and steps are generally correct and follow the problem description.
- **False**: The function definition is incorrect, and there might be issues in the gap calculation and final adjustment.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues in the function definition and potential gaps in the logic, the program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: False**
