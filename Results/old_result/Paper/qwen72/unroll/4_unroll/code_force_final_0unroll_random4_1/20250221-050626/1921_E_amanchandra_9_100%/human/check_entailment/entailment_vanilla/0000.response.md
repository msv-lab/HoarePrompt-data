### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board.
   - Alice moves down, down-right, or down-left.
   - Bob moves up, up-right, or up-left.
   - The game ends in a draw if either player cannot make a move.
   - The game ends in a win if a player moves their chip to a cell already occupied by the other player's chip.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains the dimensions of the board (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b).
   - The output should be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" for each test case.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions and chip positions.
   - It checks if Alice's initial row `a` is greater than Bob's initial row `c`. If so, it prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they will never meet.
   - If Alice's initial row is not greater than Bob's initial row, it calculates the number of moves `x` it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet.
   - If the number of moves is odd, it calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice can potentially win.
   - If the number of moves is even, it calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob can potentially win.
   - It then checks if the positions of the chips fall within these ranges and prints the appropriate result.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Step 1:** Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - **Step 2:** For each test case, read the board dimensions and chip positions.
   - **Step 3:** Check if Alice's initial row `a` is greater than Bob's initial row `c`. If so, print "Draw".
   - **Step 4:** Calculate the number of moves `x` it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet.
   - **Step 5:** If the number of moves is odd:
     - Calculate the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice can potentially win.
     - Check if Alice's chip can move to a column within this range.
     - If yes, print "Alice"; otherwise, print "Draw".
   - **Step 6:** If the number of moves is even:
     - Calculate the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob can potentially win.
     - Check if Bob's chip can move to a column within this range.
     - If yes, print "Bob"; otherwise, print "Draw".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where Alice's initial row is greater than Bob's initial row by printing "Draw".
   - The program correctly calculates the number of moves `x` and the range of columns `l` and `r` for both odd and even cases.
   - The program correctly checks if the chips can move to a column within the calculated range and prints the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided reasoning and steps. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
