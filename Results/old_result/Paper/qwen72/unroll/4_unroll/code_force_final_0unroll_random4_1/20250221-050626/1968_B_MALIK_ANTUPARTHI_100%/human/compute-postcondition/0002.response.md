Output State: **t remains an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m remain integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, a is an integer input, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5. The loop prints the value of k for each iteration of the outer loop, where k is the index in the string d up to which the characters of d can be found in e in the same order.**
