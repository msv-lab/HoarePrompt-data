Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Input for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. **Counting Problem Difficulties**: It uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
4. **Calculating Missing Problems**: It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the difficulty level is missing in the problem bank (`hmp`). If it is missing, it adds `m` to `ans` because `m` rounds each require one problem of that difficulty.
   - For each difficulty level that is present but has fewer than `m` occurrences, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` to ensure there are enough problems for all `m` rounds.
5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

This approach correctly handles the problem requirements and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
