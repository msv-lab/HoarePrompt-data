You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters, but the problem description implies that the input will be provided in the form of multiple test cases, each containing four integers p_i (0 \le p_i \le 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer where 1 \le t \le 10^4.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3))
        
    #State: The loop will execute for a total of t iterations, where t is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the output will be the sum of the integer division of each of the four input integers by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of the input integers are odd. The state of the variables a, b, c, and d will be reset for each new test case, and the loop variable i will increment from 0 to t-1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each containing four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence. It returns a result for each test case based on these counts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
