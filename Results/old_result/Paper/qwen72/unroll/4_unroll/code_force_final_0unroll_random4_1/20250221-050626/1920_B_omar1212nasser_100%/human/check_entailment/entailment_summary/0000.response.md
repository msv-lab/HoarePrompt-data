### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy for Alice and Bob:**
   - **Alice's Strategy:** Alice wants to maximize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove the smallest elements from the array because removing the smallest elements will have the least impact on the sum.
   - **Bob's Strategy:** Bob wants to minimize the sum of the array. The optimal strategy for Bob is to multiply the largest elements by -1 because this will reduce the sum the most.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - `func_2` calculates the sum of the elements in the sorted list `elements`.
   - It then considers the effect of Bob's strategy by calculating the sum of the last `negatives` elements and subtracting twice this sum from the total sum. This is because multiplying the largest elements by -1 effectively subtracts their value twice (once for removing the positive value and once for adding the negative value).
   - The function iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `removals`), adjusting the sum accordingly.
   - For each possible removal, it updates the sum by removing the smallest elements and then recalculates the effect of Bob's strategy on the remaining elements.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum sum obtained from all possible removals.

4. **Validation of the Approach:**
   - The approach in `func_2` correctly considers the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.
   - Alice's removals are handled by removing the smallest elements, which is the correct strategy to maximize the sum.
   - Bob's negations are handled by considering the largest elements, which is the correct strategy to minimize the sum.
   - The function returns the maximum possible sum after both players have played optimally.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` are 0, or when `k` and `x` are equal to `n`.
   - The sorting of the list ensures that the smallest elements are removed first, and the largest elements are considered for negation.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
