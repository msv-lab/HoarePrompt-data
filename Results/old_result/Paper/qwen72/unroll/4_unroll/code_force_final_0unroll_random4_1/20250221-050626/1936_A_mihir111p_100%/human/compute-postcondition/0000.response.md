Based on the initial state provided, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), where \(n\) is the length of the permutation \(p\). The `print` statement will output these variables in the specified format.

Let's break down the output step by step:
1. The string `'?'` will be printed first.
2. The value of `a` will be printed next. Since `a` is a non-negative integer less than `n`, it can be any value from 0 to \(n-1\).
3. The value of `b` will be printed after `a`. Similarly, `b` can be any value from 0 to \(n-1\).
4. The value of `c` will be printed after `b`. Again, `c` can be any value from 0 to \(n-1\).
5. The value of `d` will be printed last. `d` can also be any value from 0 to \(n-1\).

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the given constraints.

Output: **? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p)**
