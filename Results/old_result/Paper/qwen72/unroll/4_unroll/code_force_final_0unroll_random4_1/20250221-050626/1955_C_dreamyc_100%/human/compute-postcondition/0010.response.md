The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`. `k` is a positive integer. `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function returns either:

- Case_1: The positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- Case_2: The sum of the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` and the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, where each element is counted at most once.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns either the number of elements in `nums` (if Case_1 is met) or the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` and the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the integer division of `k` by 2, ensuring each element is counted at most once.**
