Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the cost of moving from one city to its closest city. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. It always sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the forward city is closer, which is incorrect. The closest city should be determined based on the minimum distance, and the cost should be 1 coin if the closest city is the forward or backward city, but the actual distance otherwise.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are supposed to store the cumulative cost of moving from the first city to the i-th city and from the last city to the i-th city, respectively. However, the program incorrectly adds the values from `func_1` directly to the prefix sum arrays, which does not account for the 1 coin cost of moving to the closest city.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program prints the difference between the prefix sums for the cities in the query, but this approach does not correctly handle the minimum cost of moving between cities. The correct approach should consider the cost of moving to the closest city and then to the target city.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest_cities[i] = 1  # The closest city to the first city is the second city
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest_cities[i] = n - 2  # The closest city to the last city is the second last city
        else:
            if abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]) <= abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]):
                closest_cities[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest_cities[i] = i + 1
    return closest_cities

def min_cost(cities, closest_cities, x, y):
    if x == y:
        return 0
    if abs(cities[x - 1] - cities[y - 1]) <= 1:
        return abs(cities[x - 1] - cities[y - 1])
    
    cost = 0
    while x != y:
        if abs(cities[x - 1] - cities[y - 1]) <= 1:
            cost += abs(cities[x - 1] - cities[y - 1])
            break
        if abs(cities[closest_cities[x - 1]] - cities[x - 1]) < abs(cities[y - 1] - cities[x - 1]):
            x = closest_cities[x - 1]
            cost += 1
        else:
            y = closest_cities[y - 1]
            cost += 1
    return cost

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    closest_cities = func_1(cities, n)
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min_cost(cities, closest_cities, a, b))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **func_1**:
   - This function correctly determines the closest city for each city. For the first city, the closest city is the second city, and for the last city, the closest city is the second last city. For all other cities, it checks which of the two neighboring cities is closer and stores the index of the closest city.

2. **min_cost**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `x` to city `y`. It uses the `closest_cities` array to move to the closest city at a cost of 1 coin until the cities are adjacent, at which point it directly calculates the distance.

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the input, calculates the closest cities, and processes each query using the `min_cost` function.

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
