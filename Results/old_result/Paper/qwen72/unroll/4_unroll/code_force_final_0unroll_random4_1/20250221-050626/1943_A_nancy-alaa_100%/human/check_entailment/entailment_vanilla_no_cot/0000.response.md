Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to find the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in the array `arr`.
   - If `i` is not in the `Counter` keys, it prints `i` and breaks the loop, as this is the MEX.
   - If `i` is in the `Counter` keys and its count is 1, it checks if `first` is `True`. If `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because if `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked the first unique element, and Bob will pick the next unique element, making `i` the MEX.
   - If `i` is in the `Counter` keys and its count is 1, and `first` is `False`, it sets `first` to `True`. This indicates that Alice has picked the first unique element.

The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally:
- Alice will always try to pick the smallest unique element first to maximize the MEX.
- Bob will try to pick the next smallest unique element to minimize the MEX.

The program correctly handles the constraints and multiple test cases, ensuring that the MEX is found efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.
