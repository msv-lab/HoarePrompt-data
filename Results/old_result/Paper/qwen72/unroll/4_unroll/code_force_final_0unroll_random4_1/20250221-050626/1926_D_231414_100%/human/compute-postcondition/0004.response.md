The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. Each element `a_j` in the list `a` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of a list of integers `a`, and the list `a` itself (where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined in the constraints.**
