### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.
   - It then reads the constraints for each test case, which are pairs of integers `(a, x)`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The list `r` is used to store the results for each test case.
   - The set `cx` is used to store the values that `k` must not be (type 3 constraints).
   - The variable `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - The variable `bx` is initialized to a small value (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For type 1 constraints (`k >= x`), the program updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the smallest value that `k` can be.
   - For type 2 constraints (`k <= x`), the program updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the largest value that `k` can be.
   - For type 3 constraints (`k != x`), the program adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that all values that `k` must not be are stored.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is true, it means there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines, which matches the expected output format.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Correct Handling of Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The use of `max` and `min` functions ensures that the bounds `bx` and `ax` are correctly set.
  - This is crucial for determining the valid range of `k`.

- **Correct Handling of Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The set `cx` is used to store the values that `k` must not be.
  - The program correctly iterates over the set `cx` and checks if each value falls within the range `[bx, ax]`.
  - The count of such values is subtracted from the total range to get the number of valid integers `k`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the program correctly appends `0` to the result list, indicating no valid `k`.
  - If there are no type 3 constraints, the program correctly calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and appends the result to the list.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. It correctly calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
