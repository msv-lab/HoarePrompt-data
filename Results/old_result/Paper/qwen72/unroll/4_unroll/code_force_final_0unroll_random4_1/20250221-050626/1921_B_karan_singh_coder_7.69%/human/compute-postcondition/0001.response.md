Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, and `f` are unchanged from the initial state, as they are re-assigned within each iteration of the loop. The variables `s1`, `t1`, `cnt`, and `d` are local to each iteration and do not persist outside the loop.**
