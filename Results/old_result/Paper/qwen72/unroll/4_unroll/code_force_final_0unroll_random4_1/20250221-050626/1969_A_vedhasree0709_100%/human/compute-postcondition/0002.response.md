The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems to operate within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all `p_i` are distinct.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input `n` and `p`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `p` is a list of distinct integers between 1 and `n` (inclusive) with no integer equal to its index.**
