### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of the binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes three variables: `i` (index for string `a`), `j` (index for string `b`), and `c` (count of matching characters).

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the strings `a` and `b` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not `-1`), it updates `j` to the next position (`new_j + 1`), increments `i` by 1, and increments the count `c` by 1.
   - If `func_1` returns `-1`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that no further characters of `a` can be matched as a subsequence in `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` is designed to find the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - It uses the `find` method to locate the character `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character relative to the original string `b` (`j + index`).
   - If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the count `c`, which represents the maximum length `k` such that the prefix of `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of `b`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where `a` or `b` are empty or contain no matching characters correctly.
   - It also handles cases where `a` is longer than `b` and vice versa.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length `k` such that the prefix of `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of `b`. The function `func_1` is used appropriately to find the next matching character in `b` for the current character in `a`. The program also correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
