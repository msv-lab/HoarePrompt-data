You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code:

    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `tests` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. The loop prints 'NO' if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if at least one character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tests`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `slength` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program initializes a variable `no` to `True`, which will be used to determine if a valid template exists.

3. **Immediate Check for Equality:**
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`.
   - This check is correct because if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, then `c` will match any template that `a` or `b` matches, making it impossible to find a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

4. **Character Check:**
   - If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, the program iterates through each character `x` in `c`.
   - It checks if `x` is not present in `a` or `b`. If such a character is found, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
   - This check is incorrect. The program should not just check if a character in `c` is not present in `a` or `b`. Instead, it should check if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be equal to `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
     - Additionally, `c[i]` must not match the template `t` for at least one position `i`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each position `i`, the program should check if there is a way to set `t[i]` such that:
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` match the template.
     - `c[i]` does not match the template.
   - This can be done by:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `t[i]` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `t[i]` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - `c[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The current program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a valid template exists. It only checks if there is a character in `c` that is not present in `a` or `b`, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.
