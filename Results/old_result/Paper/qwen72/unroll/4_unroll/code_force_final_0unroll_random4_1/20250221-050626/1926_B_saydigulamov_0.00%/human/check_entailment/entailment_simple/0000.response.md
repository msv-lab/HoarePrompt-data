Reasoning:  
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. However, the logic within the function to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Reading the Grid**: The program correctly reads the grid and counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. This part is logically sound.

2. **Shape Determination**: The program checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's and prints the list of counts if they do. This is incorrect because:
   - It only checks the first two rows, which is not sufficient to determine the shape of the entire grid.
   - It does not check the pattern of '1's in the rows to determine if they form a triangle or a square.
   - It prints the list of counts instead of "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

To correctly determine the shape, the program should:
- Check if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern consistent with a triangle or a square.
- Print "SQUARE" if the number of '1's in each row is the same.
- Print "TRIANGLE" if the number of '1's in each row forms a pattern of 1, 3, 5, ..., 2k-1 or 2k-1, 2k-3, ..., 1.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
