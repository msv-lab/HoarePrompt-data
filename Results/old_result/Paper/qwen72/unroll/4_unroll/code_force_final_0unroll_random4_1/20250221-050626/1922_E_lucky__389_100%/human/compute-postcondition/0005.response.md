The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `0`. The initial state describes the context and some variables, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the value `0` being printed.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state provides information about the function `func_1`, the input integer `x`, the empty list `subseq_lens`, and the integer `mx`.
2. However, none of these variables are referenced in the `print` statement.
3. The `print` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
