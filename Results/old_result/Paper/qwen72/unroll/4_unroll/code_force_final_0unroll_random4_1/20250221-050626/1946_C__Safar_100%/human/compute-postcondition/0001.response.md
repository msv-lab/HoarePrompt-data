The only objects in the loop head are the variables `a`, `b`, and the list `edges`. The loop will execute if `edges` is not empty. Given the initial state, `n` and `k` are integers with the condition 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n and a != b, representing the edges of the tree. The list `g` is a list of empty lists with a length of `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute, `edges` must contain at least one tuple. Before the loop starts, `a` and `b` are not defined, but they will be assigned the values of the first tuple in `edges` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples (a, b) where 1 <= a, b <= n and a != b, and `edges` must have at least one tuple, `g` is a list of empty lists with a length of `n + 1`, `a` and `b` are the values of the first tuple in `edges`**
