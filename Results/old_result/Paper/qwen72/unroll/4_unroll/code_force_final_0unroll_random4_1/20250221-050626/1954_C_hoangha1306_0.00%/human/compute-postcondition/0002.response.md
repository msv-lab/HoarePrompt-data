Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints two strings `kq1` and `kq2` which are the result of comparing the digits of the input strings `a` and `b`. If the digits at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If the digits are different, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit is added to `kq2` for the first difference encountered, and then the larger digit is added to `kq1` and the smaller digit is added to `kq2` for all subsequent differences. The loop iterates `t` times, processing `t` pairs of input strings. After all iterations, `t` pairs of `kq1` and `kq2` are printed.**
