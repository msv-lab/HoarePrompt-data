Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The program correctly addresses the problem by generating a string that meets the criteria for the number of special characters. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd, the program correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must have exactly one neighbor that is the same.
3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the program prints "YES" and constructs a string that has exactly `n` special characters. The pattern used is alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which ensures that each 'A' and 'B' is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern is constructed by appending pairs of 'A' and 'B' in an alternating manner. For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be 'ABABAB'. Each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', making each character a special character.
5. **Output**: The constructed string is printed, and its length is at most 200, which meets the problem's constraints.

The program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
