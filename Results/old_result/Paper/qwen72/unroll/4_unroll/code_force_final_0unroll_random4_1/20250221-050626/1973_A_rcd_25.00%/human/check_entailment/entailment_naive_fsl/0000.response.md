Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
1 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

The program incorrectly outputs 3 instead of 2. The correct solution should consider that the maximum number of draws is the sum of the minimum points that the two players with the lowest scores can have, which in this case is 1 + 1 = 2. The program's logic for adjusting the number of draws based on the difference between the highest score and the other two scores is not correct.
