### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.
   - This is correct because if `n` is odd, it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair, and an odd number of pairs cannot be formed.

3. **Even `n` Handling:**
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then constructs a pattern to form the string. The pattern is created by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be 'ABABAB', which has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, 6).

4. **Pattern Construction:**
   - The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times.
   - In each iteration, it appends two characters to the pattern: one from 'A' and one from 'B', alternating them.
   - The use of `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` ensures that the characters alternate correctly. Specifically:
     - `i % 2` will be 0 for even `i` and 1 for odd `i`.
     - `i % 2 ^ 1` will be 1 for even `i` and 0 for odd `i`.
   - This results in the pattern 'ABABAB...' for even `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed pattern as a string using `''.join(pattern)`.
   - The string length is exactly `n` for even `n`, which is within the constraint of 200 for the given problem.

### Validation with Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that the loop will execute `t` times, each time reading a new value of `n` from the user.
- For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it will print 'NO'.
- If `n` is even, it will print 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'A' and 'B' characters.
- The pattern is constructed correctly, ensuring that each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` holds the last input value read.
- The list `pattern` is populated with the last generated pattern if `n` was even, otherwise, it remains an empty list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n`, and it constructs a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's requirements. The string length is at most `200` for the given constraints, and the pattern ensures that each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
