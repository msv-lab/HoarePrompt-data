Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, pre is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in s1 is '>'**

Explanation:
- The variable `s1` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the specified range.
- The list `pre` is created by iterating over `s1` and collecting the indices (1-based) where the character is '>'. This means `pre` will contain the positions of all '>' characters in `s1`.
