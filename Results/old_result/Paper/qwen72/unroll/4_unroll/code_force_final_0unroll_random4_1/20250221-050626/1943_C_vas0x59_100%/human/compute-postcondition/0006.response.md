Output State: **`n` remains the same, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the nodes directly connected to the corresponding node, forming an undirected graph, `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `_` is an unused variable, `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`.**

The value of `a` is now the result of the function `func_1` when called with the argument `d`, which represents the shortest distances from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
