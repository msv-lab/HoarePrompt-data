#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described in the problem. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        
        mp[0].append(0)
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `index` is the index of the first element after the last element used in the loop, `t` is the same integer value as in the initial state, `results` is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings based on the loop's conditions.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES' or 'NO' (where each 'YES' or 'NO' is an element from the `results` list, and each element is printed on a new line)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, processes a series of queries on the input data, and prints a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function modifies the `data` list by consuming its elements, updates the `index` to the position after the last used element, and maintains the `t` value as the number of test cases. The `results` list contains the outcomes of the queries, which are printed at the end of the function. Each 'YES' or 'NO' in the `results` list indicates whether a specific condition is met for each query.
