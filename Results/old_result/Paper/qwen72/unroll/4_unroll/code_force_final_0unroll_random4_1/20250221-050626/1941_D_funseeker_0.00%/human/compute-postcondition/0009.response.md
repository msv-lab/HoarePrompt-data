Let's break down the task step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times.
- If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is excluded from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Set and Function Calls**:
   - The initial set `ans` is populated with values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
   - These operations are performed for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`, repeated `m` times.

2. **Modification of `ans`**:
   - After the operations, if `0` is found in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to `ans`.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, the set remains unchanged.

3. **Printing the Set**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the set `ans` separated by spaces.

### Output Determination:
- Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `ans`.
- However, we can describe the set `ans` based on the given conditions:
  - `ans` contains all possible values generated by the operations `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
  - If `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the set `ans` after the modifications described.

Output: **[values in ans] (where ans is a set containing all possible values generated by the operations (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial set and each r and c returned by func_1(), repeated m times, and if 0 is in ans, it is replaced by n)**
