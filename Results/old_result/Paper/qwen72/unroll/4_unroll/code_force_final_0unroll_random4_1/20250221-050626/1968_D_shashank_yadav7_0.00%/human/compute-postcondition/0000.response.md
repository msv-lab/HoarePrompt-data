Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take the following parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` (integers for each test case representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively), `p` (a list of integers representing the permutation), and `a` (a list of integers representing the array). The parameters should satisfy the constraints: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `t` is now an integer input by the user.**
