The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input value must be greater than 0. The state of `t` and the conditions for `n`, `a`, and `b` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the initial state provided.

Since the loop head only involves the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the loop itself.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, the input value must be greater than 0**
