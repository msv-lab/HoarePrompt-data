Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `nums` remains unchanged, `a` remains the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` remains the integer division of `k` by 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when the list is traversed in reverse, but each element is counted at most once. `s_a` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and `s_b` is the sum of the elements in `nums` (since both `s_a` and `s_b` will have summed the entire list after the loop).**
