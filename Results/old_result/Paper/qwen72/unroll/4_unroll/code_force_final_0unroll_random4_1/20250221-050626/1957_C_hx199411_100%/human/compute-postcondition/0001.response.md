The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is the integer value input by the user. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is the integer value input by the user and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each of the k moves, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and (r_i, c_i) are valid moves ensuring no two rooks attack each other. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
