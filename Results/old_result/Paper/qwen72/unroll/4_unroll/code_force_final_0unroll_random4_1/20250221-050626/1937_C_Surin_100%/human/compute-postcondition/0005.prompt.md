You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
            elif r == '=':
                print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                r2 = input('')
                if r2 == '<':
                    prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop will output two integers, `prev` and `v1`, which are indices in the permutation `p` such that `p[prev]` and `p[v1]` are the maximum and second maximum values in the permutation, respectively. The loop will complete all iterations for each test case, and the final values of `prev` and `v1` will be printed in the format `! prev v1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to determine and return a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
