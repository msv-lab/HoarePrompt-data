Initial State: The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem description. The function should take parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

Code Snippet:
```
n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet reads input from the user and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The initial state mentions that the function `func_1` is not properly defined, but this code snippet does not define the function. It only affects the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is not properly defined for the given problem description. `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers read from the input.**
