The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the dimensions of Bob's rectangle. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer. The constraints are: 1 <= a, b <= 10^9 and 1 <= t <= 10^4.

Output:
- For each test case, the function returns a result based on the dimensions `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle, and handles multiple test cases specified by an integer `t`. For each test case, it returns a result based on the dimensions `a` and `b`.**
