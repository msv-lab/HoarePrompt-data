Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. If `n` is equal to `m`, then it is possible to build the tower by adding one cube in each of the `n` moves. This is correct.
2. If `n` is less than `m`, then it is not possible to build the tower because there are not enough moves to add the required number of cubes. This is also correct.
3. If `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), then it is possible to build the tower. This is because:
   - If `n` is even, then the number of additions and removals must also be even, and the difference between `n` and `m` must be even.
   - If `n` is odd, then the number of additions and removals must also be odd, and the difference between `n` and `m` must be odd.
   - In both cases, the parity condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` can be achieved by a combination of additions and removals.
4. If `n` and `m` have different parities, then it is not possible to build the tower because the difference between `n` and `m` would be odd, and you cannot achieve an odd difference with an even number of moves or vice versa.

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example:
- For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the output is "YES" because `n` is equal to `m`.
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the output is "NO" because `n` is less than `m`.
- For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the output is "Yes" because `n` and `m` have the same parity.

The program also follows the input and output format specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
