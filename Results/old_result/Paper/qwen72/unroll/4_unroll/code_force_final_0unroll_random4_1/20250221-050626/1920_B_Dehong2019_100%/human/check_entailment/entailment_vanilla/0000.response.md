### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order. This is a good approach because Alice will want to remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob will want to multiply the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial sum of the array `a` and stores it in `ans1`.

3. **Bob's Move:**
   - The program simulates Bob's move by iterating over the first `x` elements and subtracting twice their value from `ans1`. This is because multiplying an element by -1 and then adding it to the sum is equivalent to subtracting twice the element's value from the initial sum.

4. **Alice's Move:**
   - The program then simulates Alice's move by iterating over the first `k` elements. For each element, it adds the element's value to `ans1` (as if Alice removed it).
   - If the index `i + x` is within the bounds of the array, it subtracts twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1` to account for Bob's potential move after Alice's removal.
   - It keeps track of the maximum sum `ans2` after each iteration of Alice's move.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the maximum sum `ans2` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array:**
  - Sorting the array in descending order is a good strategy because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements and Bob to target the largest elements for negation.
- **Initial Sum Calculation:**
  - The initial sum calculation is correct.
- **Bob's Move:**
  - The logic for Bob's move is correct. By subtracting twice the value of the first `x` elements, the program correctly simulates Bob's negation of the largest elements.
- **Alice's Move:**
  - The logic for Alice's move is also correct. By adding the value of the first `k` elements to `ans1` and adjusting for Bob's potential negation, the program correctly simulates Alice's removal of the smallest elements.
- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  - The program correctly keeps track of the maximum sum after each iteration of Alice's move.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
