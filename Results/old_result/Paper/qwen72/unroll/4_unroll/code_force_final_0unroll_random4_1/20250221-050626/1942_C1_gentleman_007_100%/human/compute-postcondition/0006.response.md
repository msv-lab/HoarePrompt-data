The function `func_8` accepts a parameter `l`, which is a 2D list of integers, where each sublist has the same length. The function returns a 2D list `p` of integers. Each element `p[i][j]` (for `1 <= i <= n` and `1 <= j <= m`) in the returned list `p` represents the sum of all elements in `l` from the top-left corner `(0,0)` to the current position `(i-1, j-1)`. The dimensions of `p` are `(n + 1) x (m + 1)`, and the first row and first column of `p` are all zeros.
