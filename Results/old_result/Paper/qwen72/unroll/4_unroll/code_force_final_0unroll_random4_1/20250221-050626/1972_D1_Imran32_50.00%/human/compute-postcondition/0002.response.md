Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, where `n` is the first integer and `k` is the second integer. `ans` is equal to `n`. `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.** 

The value of `root` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. The values of `n`, `k`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
