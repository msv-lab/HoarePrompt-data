Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, such that 0 <= i < n. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000) representing the number of disks. `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, respectively, with -10^9 <= x[i], y[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `r` is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, with 1 <= r[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n. `visited` is a list of booleans, where `visited[i]` is now True, indicating that the i-th disk has been visited. `nodes` is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks that have been visited, and `i` has been appended to `nodes`. `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of integers or real numbers, where `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` are the coefficients used to adjust the radii of the disks.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    dx = x[i] - x[j]
    dy = y[i] - y[j]
    if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
        coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
        coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
        dfs(j)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
