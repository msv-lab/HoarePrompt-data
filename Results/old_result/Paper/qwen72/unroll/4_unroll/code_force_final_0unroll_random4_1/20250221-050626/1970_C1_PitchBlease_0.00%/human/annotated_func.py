#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and each tuple represents an edge in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of nodes directly connected to the key node by an edge. The lists contain the neighbors of each node, and each edge (u, v) is represented twice: once in `tree[u]` and once in `tree[v]`. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the edges and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaves. If the distance to either of the first two leaves is even, the function returns 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `edges`, or `start`.
