Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the smallest nonempty pile has a size of 1 and there are other piles with sizes greater than 1. In such a case, the first player (Alice) must choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, and the second player (Bob) can then win on the next turn by choosing a larger \( k \) if possible. However, the program does not correctly determine the winner in this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
1 7
```
According to the problem description, Alice must choose \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, leaving the piles as:
```
0 6
```
Bob can then choose \( k = 6 \) on his turn, emptying all the piles and winning the game. The correct output should be "Bob".

However, the program incorrectly outputs "Alice" for this case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
