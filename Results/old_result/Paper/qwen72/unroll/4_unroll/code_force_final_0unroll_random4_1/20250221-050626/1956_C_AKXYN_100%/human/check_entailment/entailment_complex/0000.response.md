Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Matrix Initialization**: The function initializes a matrix `mat` with dimensions `n x n` where each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. This is not strictly necessary for the problem, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the sum `res` using the formula `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This formula is derived from the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix. The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. The sum of each row and each column is `1 + 2 + ... + n = n * (n + 1) / 2`. Since there are `n` rows and `n` columns, the total sum is `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`. However, the function uses a different formula, which is incorrect.

   - The correct formula for the maximum sum should be `n * (n * (n + 1) / 2) = n^2 * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - The function uses `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`, which is not equivalent to the correct formula.

4. **Output of Operations**: The function prints the number of operations as `2 * n` and then prints `2n` operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations. This is correct because it ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which is the optimal way to maximize the sum.

5. **Permutations**: The function uses the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for both Type 1 and Type 2 operations, which is correct and ensures that the matrix is filled optimally.

6. **Number of Operations**: The function ensures that the number of operations does not exceed `2n`, which is within the problem's constraints.

Given the incorrect sum calculation formula, the program will not output the correct maximum sum for the matrix. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
