The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` and `b` are binary strings, and `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b). The function returns a non-negative integer that is the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` within the substring `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found in the substring `b[j:]`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` within the substring `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, it returns -1.**
