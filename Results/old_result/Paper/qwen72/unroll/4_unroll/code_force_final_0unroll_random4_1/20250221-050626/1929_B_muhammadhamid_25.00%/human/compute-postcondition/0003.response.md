Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer representing the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size `n` to ensure at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the results for all test cases have been printed to the standard output. **
