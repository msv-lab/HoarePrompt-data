t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each of the k moves, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and (r_i, c_i) are valid moves ensuring no two rooks attack each other. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
