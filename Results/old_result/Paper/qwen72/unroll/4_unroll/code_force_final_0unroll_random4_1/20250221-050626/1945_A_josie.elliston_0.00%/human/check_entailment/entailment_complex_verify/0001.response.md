### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - **Introverts:** Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - **Extroverts:** Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - **Universals:** Universals can be in a tent with any number of people (1, 2, or 3).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]`**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic:**
     - If the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) can be paired with universals to form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - If `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts to form a complete tent, so the function returns `None` indicating it's impossible.
     - Otherwise, the function returns the ceiling of the total number of people (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents required.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int`**
   - **Purpose:** This function calculates the total minimum number of tents required for all participants.
   - **Logic:**
     - It first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents required for introverts (which is simply `introverts` since each introvert needs a tent alone) to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents required is exactly the number of introverts.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents required is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents required is `ceil(universals / 3)`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function should handle cases where there are combinations of introverts, extroverts, and universals, ensuring that all extroverts can be paired with two others, and universals can fill in the gaps.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Test Case 1: (1, 2, 3)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 2 extroverts + 1 universal in one tent, 2 universals in another tent.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 2: (1, 4, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts need 2 tents, but there is only 1 universal, which is not enough to form a complete tent with the remaining 1 extrovert.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 3: (1, 4, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 4 extroverts + 2 universals can form 2 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 4: (1, 1, 1)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 1 extrovert + 1 universal cannot form a complete tent of 3 people.
     - Total: -1 (impossible).
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 5: (1, 3, 2)**
     - Introverts: 1 tent (1 introvert alone)
     - Extroverts: 3 extroverts + 2 universals can form 1 tent of 3 people (extroverts) and 1 tent of 2 people (universals).
     - Total: 1 (introverts) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3 tents.
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 6: (19, 7, 18)**
     - Introverts: 19 tents (19 introverts alone)
     - Extroverts: 7 extroverts + 18 universals can form 7 tents of 3 people (extroverts + universals).
     - Total: 19 (introverts) + 7 (extroverts and universals) = 26 tents.
     - **Incorrect.** The correct output should be 28 tents, not 26. The function `func_1` should return 9 tents for 7 extroverts and 18 universals, not 7. This is because the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals can form another tent.
   - **Test Case 7: (0, 0, 0)**
     - No participants, so 0 tents.
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 8: (7, 0, 0)**
     - 7 introverts alone, so 7 tents.
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 9: (0, 24, 0)**
     - 24 extroverts, which can form 8 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 8 tents.
     - **Correct.**
   - **Test Case 10: (1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000)**
     - 1000000000 introverts alone, so 1000000000 tents.
     - 1000000000 extroverts + 1000000000 universals can form 1000000000 tents of 3 people each.
     - Total: 1000000000 (introverts) + 1000000000 (extroverts and universals) = 2000000000 tents.
     - **Incorrect.** The correct output should be 1666666667 tents. The function `func_1` should return 666666667 tents for 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals, not 1000000000. This is because the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals can form another tent, and so on.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program fails to correctly handle the cases where the number of extroverts and universals is large. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of tents required for extroverts and universals when the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3 and there are enough universals to form complete tents.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
