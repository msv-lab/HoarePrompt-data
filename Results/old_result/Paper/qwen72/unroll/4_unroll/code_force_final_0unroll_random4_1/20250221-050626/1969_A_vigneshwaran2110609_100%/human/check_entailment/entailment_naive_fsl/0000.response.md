Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it always prints 2 if it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints 3 otherwise. This logic is flawed because it does not consider the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party in all cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will produce:
```
2
3
2
```

This is correct for the first and third test cases but incorrect for the second test case. In the second test case, the program should print 2, not 3, because sending invitations to friends 2 and 3 (or 3 and 4) will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. The program fails to find the minimum number of invitations in this case.
