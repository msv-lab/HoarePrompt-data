### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Edge Case for Single Yogurt**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a` because Maxim can only buy one yogurt, and there is no promotion to consider.
   - This is correct because the minimum cost for one yogurt is indeed the price of one yogurt.

3. **General Case for Multiple Yogurts**:
   - The program calculates two potential costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if Maxim buys all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.
   - This approach is correct because it considers both the regular price and the promotion price, and it ensures that the minimum cost is chosen.

4. **Correctness of Cost Calculation**:
   - `ans1` is straightforward and correct.
   - `ans2` is calculated by:
     - `b * (n // 2)`: This is the cost for buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price.
     - `a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost for buying any remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - The sum of these two parts gives the total cost if Maxim uses the promotion as much as possible.
   - This calculation is correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.
   - The output format matches the expected output format as described in the problem.

### Validation Using Annotations:
- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(1 \le a, b \le 30\).
- **Inside the Loop**:
  - For each test case, the program correctly reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates `ans1` and `ans2` as described.
  - If `n` is 1, it directly prints `a`.
  - The program then prints the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2` for `n > 1`.
- **Final State**: The loop has finished executing, and for each test case, the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` has been printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values, and no new variables are introduced.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, and prints the result for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final:
**True**
