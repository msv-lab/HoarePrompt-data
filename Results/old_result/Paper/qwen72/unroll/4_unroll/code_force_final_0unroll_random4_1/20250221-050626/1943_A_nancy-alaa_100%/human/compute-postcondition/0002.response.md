The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided constraints and relationships.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
