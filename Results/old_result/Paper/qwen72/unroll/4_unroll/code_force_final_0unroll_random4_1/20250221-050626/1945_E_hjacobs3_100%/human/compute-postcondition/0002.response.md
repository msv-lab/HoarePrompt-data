The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. The loop condition is `r - l > 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, the difference between `r` and `l` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `l` is 0
- `r` is `n`

The difference `r - l` is `n - 0`, which is `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Since `n` is the length of `array` and `array` is a permutation of size `n` where 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is already an integer greater than or equal to 1. However, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` where 1 < `n` <= 2 * 10^5, and all elements in `array` are distinct integers from 1 to `n`. `find` is an integer such that 1 <= `find` <= `n`. `n` is the length of `array`. `l` is 0, `r` is `n`.**
