The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `l + 1 < r`. Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is equal to the length of `arr`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `l + 1` must be less than `r`. Given that `l` is 0, this simplifies to `1 < r`. Therefore, `r` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time. Since `r` is equal to the length of `arr`, `arr` must have at least 2 elements.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `predicate` is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean, `l` is 0, `r` is equal to the length of `arr` and `r` must be greater than 1**
