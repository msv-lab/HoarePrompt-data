The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match characters in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `t` remain unchanged, and `k` is the number of matching characters found.
