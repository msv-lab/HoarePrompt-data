Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m are integers where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^5, a is an integer input, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values and the sum of all m values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5.**

The initial state specified that `a` is a binary string of length `n`. However, after executing the code snippet `a = int(input())`, `a` is now an integer that has been input by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
