You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and `tests` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. The loop prints 'NO' if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if all characters in `c` are present in both `a` and `b`. It prints 'YES' if at least one character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 20, and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns the concatenation of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
