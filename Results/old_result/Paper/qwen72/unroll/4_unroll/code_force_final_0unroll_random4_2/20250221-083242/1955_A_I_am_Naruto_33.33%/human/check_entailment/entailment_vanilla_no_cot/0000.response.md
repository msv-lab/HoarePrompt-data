Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input and output format as specified and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the individual price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic used in the program is correct:

1. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
2. It checks if `n` is greater than 1:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, it calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost if all yogurts are bought individually at price `a`.
     - `ans2` is the cost if the maximum number of yogurts are bought in pairs at the promotional price `b`, and any remaining yogurt is bought individually at price `a`.
   - It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
3. If `n` is 1, it simply prints the cost `a` since only one yogurt is needed.

This logic ensures that the program always finds the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the individual and promotional prices. The program also correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1. Therefore, the program is correct.
