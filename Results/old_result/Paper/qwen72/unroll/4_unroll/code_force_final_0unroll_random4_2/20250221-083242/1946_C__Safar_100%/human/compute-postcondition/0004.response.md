Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and each list at index `b` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `b` by an edge. `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1.**

The code snippet `l = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `l`. The values of `g`, `n`, `k`, `edges`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the additional information that `l` is now 1.
