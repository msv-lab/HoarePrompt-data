Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves (r_i, c_i) is a pair of integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and no two moves share the same row or column. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

The value of `t` is updated to an integer input by the user, which must be within the range 1 to 10^4. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
