The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `n` and `m` are input integers, but it does not specify their values. To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so we do not need to adjust `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
