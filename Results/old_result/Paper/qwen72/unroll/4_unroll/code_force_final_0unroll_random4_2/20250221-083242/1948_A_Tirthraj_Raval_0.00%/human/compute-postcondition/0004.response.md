Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 50`. If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, the function prints 'YES', followed by a string pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'NO' for each odd `n` and 'YES' followed by the alternating pattern for each even `n`. **
