Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe each person in the queue. This is done by creating a list `c` where each element is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**: The program then calculates the suffix sums of the `c` list. The suffix sum `suff[i]` represents the total cost of bribing all people from position `i` to the end of the queue.

4. **Finding Minimum Cost**: The program iterates over the first `m` positions to find the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people. For each position `i` in the first `m` positions, it considers the cost of bribing the person at position `i` (which is `a[i]`) plus the suffix sum from position `i + 1` to the end of the queue.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the correct output format.

The logic and implementation seem to be correct and should handle the constraints and requirements of the problem effectively. Therefore, the program is correct.
