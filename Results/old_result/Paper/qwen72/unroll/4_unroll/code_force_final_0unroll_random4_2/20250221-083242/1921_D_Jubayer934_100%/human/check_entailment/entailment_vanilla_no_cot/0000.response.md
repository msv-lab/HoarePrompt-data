Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in how it selects the elements from the array `b` to maximize the difference `D`. Specifically, the program attempts to pair elements from `a` with elements from `b` in a way that might not always yield the maximum possible difference.

### Explanation of the Flaw:
1. **Sorting and Reversing `b`:** The program sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. This is a good start, but the way it pairs elements from `a` and `b` is not optimal.

2. **Pairing Elements:** The program pairs the smallest element in `a` with the largest element in `b`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. However, it then checks if pairing the smallest element in `a` with the smallest element in `b` (in reverse order) would yield a larger difference. If it finds such a pair, it switches to this method for the remaining elements.

3. **Incorrect Pairing Logic:** The logic for switching the pairing method is flawed. The program assumes that if the first element in `a` pairs better with the last element in `b` (in reverse order), then all subsequent elements should also be paired in reverse order. This assumption is incorrect because the optimal pairing might involve a mix of both methods.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the total difference `D`, Vasya should:
- Sort both arrays `a` and `b`.
- Pair the smallest element in `a` with the largest element in `b`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)
        ans = [abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n)]
        print(sum(ans))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting `a` and `b`:** Both arrays are sorted, with `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
- **Pairing Elements:** The program pairs the smallest element in `a` with the largest element in `b`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
- **Calculating the Difference:** The differences are calculated and summed up to get the total difference `D`.

This approach ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized for each test case.
