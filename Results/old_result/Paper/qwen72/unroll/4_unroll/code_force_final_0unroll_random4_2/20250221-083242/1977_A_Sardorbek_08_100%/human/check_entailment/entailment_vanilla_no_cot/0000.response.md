Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `n` is equal to `m`, it is possible to build a tower of exactly `m` cubes in `n` moves by simply adding one cube per move. The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
   - If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower of `m` cubes in `n` moves because you cannot add more cubes than the number of moves. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - If `n` is greater than `m` and both `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build a tower of `m` cubes in `n` moves. The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
   - If `n` is greater than `m` and `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to build a tower of `m` cubes in `n` moves because the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will not match the parity of `m` after an even or odd number of moves. The program correctly prints "No" in this case.

The logic and conditions in the program are consistent with the problem requirements, and the output format matches the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
