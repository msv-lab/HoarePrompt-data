Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum, `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`, is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, where each element can be a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), is \( n^2 \times \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \). This is because the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \), and each element in the matrix can be any of these numbers.

For example, when \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum should be \( 2^2 \times \frac{(2 + 1)}{2} = 4 \times 1.5 = 6 \). However, the program calculates it as \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 // 6 = 7 \), which is incorrect.

Additionally, the operations applied to the matrix are not necessary to achieve the maximum sum. The maximum sum can be achieved by simply setting each row and each column to the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) in any order, as each element in the matrix will be a number from 1 to \( n \). The program's operations are redundant and do not contribute to the correctness of the solution.
