Output State: **The loop executes `times` iterations, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `data`. After processing `data` with the given algorithm, it prints the value of `ans` which represents the count of unique XOR results with `check` (2147483647) that are not already in the dictionary `dic`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, ..., a_n`, and `check` remain unchanged as they are either input or constants.**
