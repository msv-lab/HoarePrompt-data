The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'). Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
