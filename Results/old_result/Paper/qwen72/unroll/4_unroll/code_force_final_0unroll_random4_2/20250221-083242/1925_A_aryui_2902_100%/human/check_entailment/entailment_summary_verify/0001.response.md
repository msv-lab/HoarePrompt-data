### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The output should be a string `s` for each test case that satisfies the condition.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then returned.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Subsequence Condition**: The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This means that `s` will contain each of the `k` characters at least `n` times.
   - **All Possible Subsequences**: For a string of length `n` using `k` characters, there are `k^n` possible strings. However, the constructed string `s` has a length of `k * n`, which is not necessarily sufficient to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `'abcbac'`, which is 6 characters long. However, the string `'cc'` is not a subsequence of `'abcbac'`, even though it is a valid string of length 2 using the first 3 characters.
   - **Shortest Length**: The constructed string `s` has a length of `k * n`, which is not the minimum length required to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present. The minimum length required is actually the length of the De Bruijn sequence of order `n` on a `k`-ary alphabet, which is `k^n`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the string `s` will be `'a'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `'ab'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the string `s` will be `'aa'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `'baab'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `'abcbac'`, which is incorrect because it does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 characters (e.g., `'cc'`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program constructs a string `s` that does not meet the requirements of the problem for all cases. Specifically, it fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters are present in the string `s`.
