The function `func_1` is described with specific constraints but lacks explicit parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the given constraints, we can infer that the function likely accepts multiple parameters to process a list of integers and a series of queries. Here's the inferred functionality:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, an integer `n` representing the length of a list `a` of integers, and an integer `q` representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function processes each test case and returns the results of the queries based on the list `a`.**
