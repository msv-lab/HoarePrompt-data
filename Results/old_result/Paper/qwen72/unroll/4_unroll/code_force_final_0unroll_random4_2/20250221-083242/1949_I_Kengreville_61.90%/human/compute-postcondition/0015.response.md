Postcondition: **`x` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements unchanged, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` because there is at least one element in `nodes` for which `c1` is not `0`.**
