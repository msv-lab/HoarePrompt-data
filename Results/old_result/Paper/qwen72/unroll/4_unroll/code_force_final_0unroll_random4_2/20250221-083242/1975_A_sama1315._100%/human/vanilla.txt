- The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
     - Finally, it prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and will solve the problem as described. The program will correctly determine if an array can be sorted into non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation.

### Correctness:
