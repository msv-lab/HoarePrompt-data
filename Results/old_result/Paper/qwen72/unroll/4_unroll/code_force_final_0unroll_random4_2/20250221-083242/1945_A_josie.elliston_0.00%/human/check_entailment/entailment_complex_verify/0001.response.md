### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires accommodating `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals in tents.
   - Each introvert must be in a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others.
   - Universals can be in a tent alone, with one other person, or with two others.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of tents required, or output -1 if it's impossible to meet all preferences.

2. **Analyzing Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Purpose:** Calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - **Logic:**
     - If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, all extroverts can be accommodated in complete tents.
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, the remaining extroverts (1 or 2) need to be combined with universals to form a complete tent. If there are not enough universals to form a complete tent, the function returns `None`.
     - The function then returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is divisible by 3.
     - The function correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and there are enough universals to form a complete tent.
     - The function correctly returns `None` if it's impossible to form a complete tent for the remaining extroverts.

3. **Analyzing Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Purpose:** Combine the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - **Logic:**
     - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The function correctly handles the case where it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
     - The function correctly adds the number of introverts to the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts, the number of tents is simply the number of introverts. This is correctly handled by `func_2`.
   - **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts, the number of tents is `ceil(extroverts / 3)`. This is correctly handled by `func_1`.
   - **All Universals:** If there are only universals, the number of tents is `ceil(universals / 3)`. This is correctly handled by `func_1`.
   - **Mixed Cases:** The function handles mixed cases correctly by ensuring that extroverts are always in complete tents and universals are used to fill any remaining spots.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - Input: `1 2 3`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals.
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - Input: `1 4 1`
     - Output: `-1`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 extrovert left who cannot form a complete tent with the 1 universal.
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - Input: `1 4 2`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 1 universal.
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - Input: `1 1 1`
     - Output: `-1`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 extrovert left who cannot form a complete tent with the 1 universal.
   - **Test Case 5:**
     - Input: `1 3 2`
     - Output: `3`
     - Explanation: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the 2 universals.
   - **Test Case 6:**
     - Input: `19 7 18`
     - Output: `28`
     - Explanation: 19 tents for introverts, 2 tents for 6 extroverts and 3 universals, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals. Total: 28 tents.
   - **Test Case 7:**
     - Input: `0 0 0`
     - Output: `0`
     - Explanation: No participants, so no tents needed.
   - **Test Case 8:**
     - Input: `7 0 0`
     - Output: `7`
     - Explanation: 7 introverts, so 7 tents needed.
   - **Test Case 9:**
     - Input: `0 24 0`
     - Output: `8`
     - Explanation: 24 extroverts, so 8 tents needed (24 / 3 = 8).
   - **Test Case 10:**
     - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
     - Output: `1666666667`
     - Explanation: 1000000000 introverts, 333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts, and 333333334 tents for 1000000000 universals. Total: 1666666667 tents.
