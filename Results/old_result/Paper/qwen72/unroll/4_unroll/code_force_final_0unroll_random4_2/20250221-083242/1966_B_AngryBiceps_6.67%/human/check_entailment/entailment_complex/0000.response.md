Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color through a series of operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.

The logic in the program checks two conditions:
1. If the first row is uniform in color (all 'W' or all 'B') and different from the last row.
2. If the first column is uniform in color and different from the last column.

However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution for all possible grid configurations. The program should consider the following:
- If any row or column is entirely one color, it is possible to use that row or column to color the entire grid.
- If there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid, and the grid is not already uniform, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the operations can only extend the color of a subrectangle, not change the color of a single cell.

The program's current logic only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is not enough to cover all scenarios. For example, a grid where the first and last rows are uniform but the middle rows are not, or where the first and last columns are uniform but the middle columns are not, would incorrectly be marked as 'YES'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
