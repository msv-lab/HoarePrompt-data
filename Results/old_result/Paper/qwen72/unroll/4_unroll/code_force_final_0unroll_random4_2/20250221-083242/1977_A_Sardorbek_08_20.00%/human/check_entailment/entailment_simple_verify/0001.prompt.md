You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two integers, `n` and `m`, as input where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes in the tower, respectively.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif a % 2 == b % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The variables `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, it prints 'YES' if `b == c`, 'NO' if `b < c`, 'Yes' if `a % 2 == b % 2`, and 'No' otherwise. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration, but their final values are not defined as they depend on the last input provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input, representing the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` respectively.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case:**
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, then Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower for each move. This is always possible, so the program correctly prints "YES".
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible for Nikita to have `c` cubes after `b` moves because he can only add or remove one cube per move. The program correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3: `a % 2 == b % 2`**
     - This condition checks if the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of test cases `a` is the same as the parity of the number of moves `b`. However, this is incorrect. The parity of `a` (number of test cases) should not influence the result for each individual test case. Instead, the correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is the same, it means that the difference between `b` and `c` is even, which allows for the possibility of reaching exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and an even number of moves can balance out the additions and removals to reach the desired number of cubes.
   - **Case 4: Else**
     - If none of the above conditions are met, the program correctly prints "No".

3. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition to check if it is possible to have exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves is `b % 2 == c % 2`. This ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the possibility of reaching the desired number of cubes.

### Correctness:
The program has a logical error in the condition `a % 2 == b % 2`. The correct condition should be `b % 2 == c % 2`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
