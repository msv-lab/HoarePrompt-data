The function `func_1` accepts a list of city coordinates in strictly ascending order and the number of cities `n`. It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` represents the distance to the nearest neighboring city (either the previous or the next city in the `cities` list), with a special value of 1 if the next city is closer than the previous city.
