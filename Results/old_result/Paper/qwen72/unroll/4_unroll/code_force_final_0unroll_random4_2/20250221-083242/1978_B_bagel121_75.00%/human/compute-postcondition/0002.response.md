Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases, and for each test case, the output is either `n * a` if `a >= b`, or the sum of `ans` and `p2` where `ans` is the sum of the first `k` integers starting from `b` and `p2` is `(n - k) * a` if `a < b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case are unchanged, but the loop has completed its iterations.**
