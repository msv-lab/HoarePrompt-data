You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `present` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2 + count`, where `count` is the number of times the condition `t1 not in present and t2 in present` is true during the loop iterations.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `x` remains the same, `y` remains the same, `chosen_vertices` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `present` remains the same, `ans` remains the same, `gaps` is a list of positive integers representing the gaps between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as a circular list with the last element wrapping around to the first element plus `n`).
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: - `n` remains the same.
    #   - `x` remains the same.
    #   - `y` will be the initial `y` minus the sum of all `pairs` processed, or 0 if the loop breaks.
    #   - `chosen_vertices` remains the same.
    #   - `a` remains the same.
    #   - `present` remains the same.
    #   - `ans` will be the initial `ans` plus the sum of all `gaps` processed, or the initial `ans` plus the sum of all `gaps` processed plus `2 * y` for the last `gap` that caused the break.
    #   - `gaps` remains the same.
    #
    #Output State:
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the initial ans plus the sum of all gaps processed, or the initial ans plus the sum of all gaps processed plus 2 * y for the last gap that caused the break)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sides of the polygon), `x` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), `y` (the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose), and `chosen_vertices` (a list of vertices Bessie has chosen). It returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and up to `y` additional vertices.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
