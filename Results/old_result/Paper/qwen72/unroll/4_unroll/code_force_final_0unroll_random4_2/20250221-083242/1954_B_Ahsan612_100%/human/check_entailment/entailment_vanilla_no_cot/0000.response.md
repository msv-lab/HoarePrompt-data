Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it processes the array to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the condition where the array can have elements that are not all the same but still form a beautiful array. The program incorrectly increments the index `i` and skips elements, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Initialize the minimum number of elements to remove
        minn = float('inf')
        
        # Iterate through the array to find the minimum number of elements to remove
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                minn = min(minn, 1)
        
        # If no such element is found, the array is already not beautiful
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(0)
        else:
            print(minn)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check if all elements are the same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array not beautiful by removing elements, so we output `-1`.
2. **Initialize the minimum number of elements to remove**: We set `minn` to infinity to find the minimum number of elements to remove.
3. **Iterate through the array**: We iterate through the array from the second element to the second-to-last element. If we find an element `ar[i]` such that `ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]`, we can remove `ar[i]` to potentially make the array not beautiful. We update `minn` to 1 if such an element is found.
4. **Output the result**: If `minn` is still infinity after the loop, it means the array is already not beautiful, so we output `0`. Otherwise, we output `minn`.

This corrected program ensures that we correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
