Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. It then iterates `t` times, and in each iteration, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` (where `0 <= p_i <= 200` for each `p_i` in `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`). For each set of four integers, it calculates the sum of their integer divisions by 2, plus an additional 1 if exactly three of the first three integers (`a`, `b`, `c`) are odd. The result of this calculation is printed for each iteration. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output. **
