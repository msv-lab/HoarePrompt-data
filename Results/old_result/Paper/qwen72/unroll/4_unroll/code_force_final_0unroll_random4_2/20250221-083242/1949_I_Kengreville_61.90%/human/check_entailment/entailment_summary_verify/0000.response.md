### Reasoning

The original assessment claims that the program does not correctly handle the case where all disks are initially tangent to each other and the radii cannot be changed to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency. Let's analyze the program and the function summaries to determine if this assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
1. **Input Reading**: The function reads the number of disks `n` and their respective coordinates and radii.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes several lists: `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`.
3. **DFS Initialization**: It iterates over each disk and, if the disk has not been visited, initializes the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for that disk and calls the `dfs` function.
4. **Sum Calculation**: After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the visited disks.
5. **Decision**: If `c1` is not zero, it sets `ok` to `True`. Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

#### Analysis of `dfs`:
1. **Marking Visited**: The function marks the current disk `i` as visited.
2. **Appending Node**: It appends the index `i` to the `nodes` list.
3. **Iterating Over Disks**: It iterates over all other disks `j`.
4. **Checking Tangency**: It checks if the disks `i` and `j` are tangent by comparing the squared distance between their centers to the squared sum of their radii.
5. **Updating Coefficients**: If disks `i` and `j` are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for disk `j` and recursively calls `dfs` on `j`.

#### Function Summaries:
- **`dfs`**: This function correctly identifies and processes all disks that are tangent to the current disk. It updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists to reflect the relationship between the radii of the disks.
- **`func_1`**: This function uses the results of the `dfs` function to determine if it is possible to change the radii in a way that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency.

#### Key Points:
- **Tangency Condition**: The program correctly identifies disks that are tangent to each other.
- **Coefficient Calculation**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if a valid adjustment of radii is possible. Specifically, `coef1` being non-zero indicates that there is a way to adjust the radii to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.
- **DFS Logic**: The DFS logic ensures that all connected disks (tangent to each other) are processed together.

#### Example Input Analysis:
For the example input provided in the original assessment:
```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
1 1 1
```
- **Disk 1**: Center (0, 0), Radius 1
- **Disk 2**: Center (2, 0), Radius 1
- **Disk 3**: Center (1, 1), Radius 1

All three disks are tangent to each other:
- Disk 1 and Disk 2 are tangent.
- Disk 1 and Disk 3 are tangent.
- Disk 2 and Disk 3 are tangent.

When `dfs` is called on any of these disks, it will visit all three disks and update their coefficients. The key point is whether the sum of `coef1` for all visited disks is non-zero. If `c1` is non-zero, it indicates that there is a way to adjust the radii to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.

However, in this specific case:
- The sum of `coef1` for all disks will be zero because the tangency relationships are symmetric and the coefficients will cancel each other out.

Thus, the program will correctly output `NO` for this input, indicating that it is not possible to change the radii to strictly decrease the sum while maintaining tangency.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is incorrect. The program does correctly handle the case where all disks are initially tangent to each other and the radii cannot be changed to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency. The logic in the `dfs` function and the main function `func_1` ensures that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining the tangency condition for all disks.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**
