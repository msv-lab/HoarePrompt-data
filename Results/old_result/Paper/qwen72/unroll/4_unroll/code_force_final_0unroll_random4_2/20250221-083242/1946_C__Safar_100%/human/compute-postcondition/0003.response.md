Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and each list at index `b` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `b` by an edge. `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0.**

The code snippet initializes the variable `c` to 0. The other variables `g`, `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `c` while maintaining the initial conditions for the other variables.
