You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

    #State: The loop executes `times` iterations, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `data`. After processing `data` with the given algorithm, it prints the value of `ans` which represents the count of unique XOR results with `check` (2147483647) that are not already in the dictionary `dic`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, ..., a_n`, and `check` remain unchanged as they are either input or constants.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes the list to count the number of unique XOR results with `2^31 - 1` (2147483647) that are not already in a dictionary. After processing, it prints the count for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `n`, and the list of integers are consumed during the function execution, and `check` is reset to `2^31 - 1` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires dividing a list of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two integers in the same group have the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - This means that for any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) in the same group, \( x_2(i) \neq y_2(i) \) for all \( 1 \leq i < 32 \).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If two numbers have the same bit value in any of the 31 bits, they cannot be in the same group.
   - The maximum number of groups needed is determined by the number of unique bit patterns in the 31 least significant bits.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the list of integers \( data \).
   - It initializes a dictionary \( dic \) to keep track of the counts of bit patterns and a variable \( ans \) to count the number of groups.
   - The variable \( check \) is set to \( 2^{31} - 1 \), which is a 31-bit number with all bits set to 1. This is used to mask the 31 least significant bits of each integer.
   - For each integer \( i \) in \( data \):
     - It computes \( s = i \oplus check \). This operation effectively inverts the 31 least significant bits of \( i \).
     - It checks if \( i \) is already in the dictionary \( dic \):
       - If \( i \) is in \( dic \), it decreases the count of \( i \) in \( dic \). If the count reaches 0, it removes \( i \) from \( dic \).
       - If \( i \) is not in \( dic \), it checks if \( s \) (the inverted bit pattern) is in \( dic \):
         - If \( s \) is not in \( dic \), it adds \( s \) to \( dic \) and increments \( ans \).
         - If \( s \) is in \( dic \), it increments the count of \( s \) in \( dic \).

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly inverts the 31 least significant bits of each integer using the XOR operation with \( check \).
   - However, the logic for updating the dictionary and counting the groups is flawed:
     - The program assumes that if \( i \) is already in the dictionary, it can be removed from the group. This is incorrect because removing \( i \) from the dictionary does not necessarily mean it can be placed in a new group.
     - The program also assumes that if \( s \) (the inverted bit pattern) is not in the dictionary, it should be added and a new group should be created. This is also incorrect because the inverted bit pattern \( s \) might not be a valid group member if it conflicts with other numbers in the same group.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to count the number of unique bit patterns in the 31 least significant bits of the integers.
   - Each unique bit pattern must be placed in a separate group because no two numbers with the same bit pattern can be in the same group.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the minimum number of groups required.
   - The program's logic for updating the dictionary and counting groups is flawed.
