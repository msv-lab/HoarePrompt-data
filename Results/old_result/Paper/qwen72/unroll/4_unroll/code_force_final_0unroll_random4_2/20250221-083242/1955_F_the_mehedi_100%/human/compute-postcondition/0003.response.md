Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a list of four integers `a`. It calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of 1 (if the first three integers in `a` are all odd) and the floor division of each integer in `a` by 2. The function prints `cnt` for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes. **
