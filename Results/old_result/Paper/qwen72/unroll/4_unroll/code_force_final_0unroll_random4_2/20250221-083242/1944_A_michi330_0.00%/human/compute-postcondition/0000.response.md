The value of `t` is assigned the integer value input by the user. The function `func` is still expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function should still be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, but now the number of test cases `t` is a specific integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) provided by the user.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).
