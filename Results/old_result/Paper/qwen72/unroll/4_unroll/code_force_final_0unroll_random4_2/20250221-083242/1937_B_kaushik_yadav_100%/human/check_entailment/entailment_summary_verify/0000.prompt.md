You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Output

    2
    11000
    1
    001001101

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        ans = ''
        i = 0
        work = True
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
                    work = False
                elif i + 1 == len(a):
                    ans += b[i]
                    break
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:
                ans += b[i]
                i += 1
        print(ans)
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        print(counter)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. It then constructs a string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions and prints `ans`. Additionally, it calculates and prints the number of consecutive positions starting from the beginning where `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]` or `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1'. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest string and counting the number of paths that yield this string is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0101
0011
```

**Expected Output:**
```
00001
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
00011
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The lexicographically smallest string should be "00001" because the grasshopper can take the path (1,1) → (2,1) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4) or (1,1) → (1,2) → (2,2) → (2,3) → (2,4).
- The program incorrectly outputs "00011" because it does not correctly handle the transition between the two rows to ensure the lexicographically smallest string.

The issue lies in the condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:` which does not always ensure the lexicographically smallest string. Additionally, the counter logic does not correctly account for all possible paths that yield the smallest string.
