Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Annotated Functions:
func_1()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k, x <= n, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 1000.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        
        print(product)
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n, k, and x are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= k, x <= n, and a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 1000. The loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, the sorted list a and the product of func_2(k, x, a) have been printed. The values of n, k, x, and a are reset for each iteration based on the input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it processes and prints the results for `t` test cases. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the output for each case is the result of `func_2` applied to the sorted list `a` and the integers `k` and `x`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: elements is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements).
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements). `pos` is a list with `removals + 1` elements, where the last element is `s - 2 * s2`, and `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which has `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed. The other elements in `pos` are not specified but are part of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos` that has `removals + 1` elements. Each element in `pos` represents the sum of the remaining elements in `elements` after removing the last `i` elements (for `i` ranging from 0 to `removals`), adjusted by subtracting twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the modified list. The function does not modify the input list `elements`.
