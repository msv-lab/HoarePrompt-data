The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, respectively. `n` represents the number of elements in the list `a`, and `k` is an additional integer parameter.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.**
