Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) where each tuple adheres to the initial conditions, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers provided by the user input, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of (N - 1) choose (L[-1] - 1).**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is calculated using the `math.comb` function, which computes the binomial coefficient of (N - 1) choose (L[-1] - 1).
- The values of `t`, `cases`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
- The specific value of `ans` depends on the values of `N` and the last element of `L` (denoted as `L[-1]`), but it is expressed as the binomial coefficient of (N - 1) choose (L[-1] - 1).
