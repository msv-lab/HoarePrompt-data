The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x < 10^100 and 1 <= y < 10^100, and both consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.

Since the specific return values or conditions are not provided in the output section, I will describe the general functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `x` and `y` are integers between 1 and 10^100, inclusive, and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
