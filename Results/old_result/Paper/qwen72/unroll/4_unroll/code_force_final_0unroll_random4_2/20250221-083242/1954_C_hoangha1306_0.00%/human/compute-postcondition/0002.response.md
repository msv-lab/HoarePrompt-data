Output State: **For each of the t test cases, the loop outputs two strings, kq1 and kq2, which are the result of comparing the digits of the input strings a and b. The first string, kq1, contains the lexicographically smaller digit at each position where the digits differ, and the second string, kq2, contains the lexicographically larger digit at each position where the digits differ. If the digits are the same, they are included in both kq1 and kq2. The values of t, x, and y remain unchanged.**
