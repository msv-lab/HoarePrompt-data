Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) where each tuple adheres to the initial conditions, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers provided by the user input, `L` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `R` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `ans` is the binomial coefficient of (N - 1) choose (L[-1] - 1), `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.**

The code snippet `nums_left = L[-1] - 2` assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to the variable `nums_left`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
