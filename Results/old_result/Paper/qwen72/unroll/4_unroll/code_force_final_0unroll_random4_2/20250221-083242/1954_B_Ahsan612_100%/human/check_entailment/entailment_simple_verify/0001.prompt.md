You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. If the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) or if no such segment is found, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments. The variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful.
   - A beautiful array can be modified by choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
   - If it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array. `minn` is set to infinity to track the minimum length of a segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - The program iterates through the array to find segments of consecutive identical elements and updates `minn` with the minimum length of these segments.
   - After the loop, it checks if `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array. If so, it prints -1, indicating that it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical elements.
   - However, the logic for updating `minn` and `num` is flawed. Specifically, the line `i += 1` before updating `num` and `minn` can cause the program to skip elements and incorrectly update `minn`.
   - The program should correctly handle the case where the array is entirely composed of the same element, which is already handled by checking if `minn` is equal to the length of the array.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The correct approach should be to find the minimum length of a segment of consecutive identical elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program should iterate through the array and keep track of the length of each segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - If the array is entirely composed of the same element, it should return -1.
   - If there are segments of consecutive identical elements, the minimum length of these segments should be returned.

5. **Revised Program:**
   ```python
   def func():
       for _ in range(int(input())):
           n = int(input())
           ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
           same = 1
           num = ar[0]
           minn = inf
           for i in range(1, n):
               if ar[i] == num:
                   same += 1
               else:
                   minn = min(minn, same)
                   same = 1
                   num = ar[i]
           minn = min(minn, same)
           if minn == inf or minn == n:
               print(-1)
           else:
               print(minn)
   ```

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has a logical error in the way it updates `minn` and `num`. Specifically, the line `i += 1` before updating `num` and `minn` can cause the program to skip elements and incorrectly update `minn`. This can lead to incorrect results in some cases. The revised program addresses this issue and should correctly solve the problem.
