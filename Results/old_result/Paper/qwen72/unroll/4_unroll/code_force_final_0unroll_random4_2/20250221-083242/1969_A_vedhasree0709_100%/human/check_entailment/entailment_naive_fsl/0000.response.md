Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks for a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this approach does not always yield the correct minimum number of invitations required.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
2 3 4 5 1
```
In this case, the friends form a cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 3 friends (e.g., 1, 2, and 3), but the program will incorrectly print `3` without considering the possibility of a cycle.

Another example where the program fails:
```
1
4
3 4 1 2
```
Here, the friends form two pairs: (1, 3) and (2, 4). To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 2 friends (e.g., 1 and 3), but the program will incorrectly print `3` because it does not handle multiple pairs correctly.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
