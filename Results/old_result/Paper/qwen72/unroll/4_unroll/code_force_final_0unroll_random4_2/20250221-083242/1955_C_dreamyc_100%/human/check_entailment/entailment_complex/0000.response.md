Reasoning:

The program aims to determine how many ships are sunk after the Kraken attacks them `k` times. The ships are attacked in a specific order: first the first ship, then the last, then the first again, and so on. Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1, and a ship sinks when its durability reaches 0.

The function `func_1` is designed to solve this problem. Let's break down the logic and check if it correctly handles the problem:

1. **Initial Check**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all `nums`, the Kraken will attack until all ships have sunk. Therefore, the function returns `n` (the total number of ships).
   - This is correct because if the total number of attacks is sufficient to reduce the durability of all ships to 0, all ships will sink.

2. **Prefix and Suffix Sums**:
   - The function calculates the prefix sum `s_a` and the suffix sum `s_b` while iterating through the list `nums`.
   - `a` is calculated as `math.ceil(k / 2)`, which represents the number of attacks on the first ship.
   - `b` is calculated as `k // 2`, which represents the number of attacks on the last ship.
   - The function increments `ans` if the prefix sum `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and if the suffix sum `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`.

3. **Logic Flaw**:
   - The logic of incrementing `ans` based on the prefix and suffix sums is incorrect. The function should track the number of ships that have been sunk, not the number of elements contributing to the sums.
   - The current implementation does not correctly simulate the attack sequence. It should keep track of the remaining durability of the ships and simulate the attacks until `k` attacks are made or all ships have sunk.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve using a deque to simulate the attack sequence. The deque allows efficient removal of elements from both ends.
   - The function should decrement the durability of the ships at the front and back of the deque, removing them if their durability reaches 0.
   - The function should continue this process until `k` attacks are made or the deque is empty.

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly simulate the attack sequence and does not accurately count the number of sunk ships. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
