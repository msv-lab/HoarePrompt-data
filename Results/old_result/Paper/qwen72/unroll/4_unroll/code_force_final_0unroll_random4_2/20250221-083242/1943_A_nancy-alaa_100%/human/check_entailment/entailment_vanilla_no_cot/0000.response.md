Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game based on the optimal play by Alice and Bob. The program follows these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
3. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
4. It iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` that Alice and Bob are constructing.
5. It checks if the current number `i` is not in the `Counter` (i.e., it is not in the array `arr`). If so, it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks the loop.
6. If `i` is in the `Counter` and its count is 1, it checks if this is the first occurrence of such a number. If it is, it sets `first` to `True`. If it is not the first occurrence, it prints `i` as the MEX and breaks the loop.

This logic ensures that Alice and Bob are playing optimally:
- Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` or the smallest number that appears only once in `arr` if it is her first turn to pick such a number.
- Bob will try to pick the smallest number that appears only once in `arr` if it is his turn to pick such a number, to prevent Alice from picking it and increasing the MEX.

The program correctly handles the constraints and multiple test cases, and it produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
