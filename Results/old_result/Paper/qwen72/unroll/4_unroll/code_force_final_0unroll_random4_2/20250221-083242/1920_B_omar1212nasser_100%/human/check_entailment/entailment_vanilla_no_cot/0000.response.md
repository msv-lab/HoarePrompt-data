Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal play for both Alice and Bob correctly. Here are the issues:

1. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the program is removing the largest elements (elements[-i]) which are at the end of the sorted list. This is incorrect because removing the smallest elements would increase the sum more effectively.

2. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob should multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The program is considering the last `x` elements, which are the largest elements, and subtracting twice their sum. This is incorrect because Bob should target the smallest elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the number of elements to be removed or negated exceeds the length of the array. For example, if `k` or `x` is equal to `n`, the program should handle these cases appropriately.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice's optimal strategy: remove the smallest elements
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Bob's optimal strategy: multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1
    elements.sort()
    for i in range(min(negatives, len(elements))):
        if elements[i] > 0:
            break
        elements[i] = -elements[i]
    
    # Calculate the final sum
    return sum(elements)
```

**Explanation of the corrected program:**

1. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Alice removes the smallest `k` elements by slicing the list `elements[removals:]`.

2. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Bob multiplies the smallest `x` elements by -1. The program sorts the remaining elements and iterates through the first `x` elements, changing their sign if they are negative.

3. **Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum is calculated by summing the modified elements.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
