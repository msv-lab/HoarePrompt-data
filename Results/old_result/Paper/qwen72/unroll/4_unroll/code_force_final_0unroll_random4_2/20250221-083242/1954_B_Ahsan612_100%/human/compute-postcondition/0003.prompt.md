You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the length of the array and an array a of integers. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element a_i in the array a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. If the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) or if no such segment is found, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments. The variables `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the array for each test case), and `a` (array of integers for each test case). It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
