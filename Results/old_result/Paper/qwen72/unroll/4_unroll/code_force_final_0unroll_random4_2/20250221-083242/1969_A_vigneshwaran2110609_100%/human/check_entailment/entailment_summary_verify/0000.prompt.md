You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It checks if there is any index `i` in the range `[0, x)` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop for that test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3` after completing the loop. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input `n`. The final state of the program includes `n` lines of output, each containing either `2` or `3` depending on the input for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it prints `2` or `3` without considering the actual structure of the friendship pairs. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
3
2
```

However, the program will fail for a different input:

**Input:**
```
1
4
4 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

In this case, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`. The correct minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party is `2`, specifically to friends `1` and `2`. Both friends `1` and `2` will come because their best friends `4` and `1` respectively, have also received invitations. The program, however, prints `3` because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed.
