You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, f and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. The loop has executed all iterations, and for each iteration, the list `a` has been sorted in descending order, and the values of `f` and `k` have been decremented by 1. The loop has printed 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' for each iteration based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, and two indices `f` and `k` (both 1-based), followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the element at index `f` (0-based) in the original list is greater than, less than, or equal to the element at index `k` (0-based) in the sorted list (in descending order). If the element at `f` is greater than the element at `k` in the sorted list, it prints 'NO'. If it is less, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' if `k` is the last index of the sorted list or the next element in the sorted list is less than the element at `f`, otherwise it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from both.

2. **Favorite Cube Value**:
   - The program correctly identifies the value `x` of Dmitry's favorite cube by accessing `a[f]`.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`. This ensures that the cubes are arranged from the largest to the smallest value.

4. **Comparison**:
   - The program then checks the value of the `k`-th cube in the sorted list `a[k]`:
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. The program correctly prints "NO".
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The program correctly prints "YES".
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube could be in the `k`-th position or beyond. The program then checks:
       - If `k == n - 1`, it means `k` is the last position, and the favorite cube will be removed. The program correctly prints "YES".
       - If `a[k + 1] < x`, it means the favorite cube is in the `k`-th position and will be removed. The program correctly prints "YES".
       - Otherwise, the favorite cube could be in the `k`-th position or beyond, so it may or may not be removed. The program correctly prints "MAYBE".

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It accurately determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed based on the given conditions.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
