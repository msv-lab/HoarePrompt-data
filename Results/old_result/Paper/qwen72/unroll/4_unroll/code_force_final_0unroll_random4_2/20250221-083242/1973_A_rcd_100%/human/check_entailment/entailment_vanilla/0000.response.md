### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The function first checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must always be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

3. **Checking for Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the function then checks if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2` because the highest score player could have drawn all games with the other two players.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the function enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws in the Loop:**
   - The loop initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It iterates while `y` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not true, it increments `x` by 1 and decrements `y` by 1.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid combination, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no games were played (`0 0 0`), which results in `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`), which results in `-1`.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the total points are even and then finding the maximum number of draws that can be distributed among the players while maintaining the given scores.
   - The loop ensures that the maximum number of draws is found by adjusting the points of the players until a valid combination is found or the loop completes.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on the given scores. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the total points are even and the scores are consistent with a valid set of games.
