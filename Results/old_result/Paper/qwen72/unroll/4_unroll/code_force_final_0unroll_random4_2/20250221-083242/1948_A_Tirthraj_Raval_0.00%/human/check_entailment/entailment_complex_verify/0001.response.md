### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition:**
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because each special character must be part of a pair, and an odd number of pairs is not possible.
   - This reasoning is correct. For example, if `n` is 5, there is no way to arrange characters such that exactly 5 characters are special.

3. **Pattern Generation:**
   - If `n` is even, the program generates a pattern of length `n` using the characters 'A' and 'B'.
   - The pattern is generated by alternating 'A' and 'B' in pairs. For example, if `n` is 6, the pattern will be 'ABABAB'.
   - This pattern ensures that each character is special because each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A', and each character in the pattern is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The pattern generation logic is correct. The use of `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` ensures that the characters alternate correctly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the generated pattern if `n` is even.
   - The length of the generated pattern is exactly `n`, which is within the limit of 200 characters as required by the problem.
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the condition for the number of special characters, and generates a valid pattern when possible. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
