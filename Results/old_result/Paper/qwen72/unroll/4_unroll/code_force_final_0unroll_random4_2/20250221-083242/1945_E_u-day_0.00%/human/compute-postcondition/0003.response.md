The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `pos` and the content of `arr` do not affect the loop's ability to execute, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to start, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0 (as it is the starting point of the range).

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is assigned a new value by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1**
