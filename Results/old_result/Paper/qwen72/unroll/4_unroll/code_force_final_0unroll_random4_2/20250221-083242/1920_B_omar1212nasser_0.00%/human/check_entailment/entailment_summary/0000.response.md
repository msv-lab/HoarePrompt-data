### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.
   - This function is structured correctly to handle multiple test cases and call the appropriate function to compute the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for the core logic of the game.
   - It takes three parameters: `removals` (k), `negatives` (x), and `elements` (a).
   - It first checks if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, and if so, returns 0. This is a special case, but it does not affect the correctness of the function for other inputs.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the elements and the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It appends the initial value `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `removals`:
     - In each iteration, it subtracts the last element from `s`.
     - It tries to update `n` by adding the element at the position `-(negatives + i)` and subtracting the element at the position `-i`.
     - If an `IndexError` occurs (which happens when `i` exceeds the length of the list), it sets `n` to 0.
     - It appends the new value `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

### Analysis:
- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `a` is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which are the most beneficial to remove to maximize the sum) and Bob to multiply the largest elements by -1 (which are the most beneficial to minimize the sum).
- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `s` is calculated correctly.
- **Sum of Last `negatives` Elements**: The sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements is calculated correctly.
- **Iterative Removal and Negation**: The loop iterates through the possible removals, updating the sum `s` and `n` accordingly. The logic for updating `n` is correct, and the `IndexError` handling ensures that `n` is set to 0 when there are not enough elements to consider.
- **Maximizing the Sum**: The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the possible sums after each combination of removals and negations. This ensures that the optimal sum is found.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case by sorting the array and applying the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, and prints the correct output for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
