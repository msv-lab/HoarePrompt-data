### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Query Loop:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and for each `i`, it makes a query `? ans1 ans1 i i`.
   - The purpose of this loop is to find an index `i` such that `p_i` is the maximum value in the permutation. If `p_i` is greater than `p_ans1`, `ans1` is updated to `i`.

2. **Finding Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
   - It iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and for each `i`, it makes a query `? mx ans1 i ans1`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_i` is a better candidate for `mx` than the current `mx`, so `mx` is updated to `i` and `v` is reset to contain only `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p_i` is equal to the current `mx` in terms of the OR operation with `p_ans1`, so `i` is added to `v`.

3. **Final Query Loop:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `v[0]`.
   - It iterates over the list `v` and for each `i` (starting from 1), it makes a query `? ans ans v[i] v[i]`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p_v[i]` is a better candidate for `ans` than the current `ans`, so `ans` is updated to `v[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints `! ans ans1`, which is the pair of indices that maximizes `p_ans \oplus p_ans1`.

### Analysis:
- **Query Count:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The second loop makes `n-1` queries.
  - The third loop makes at most `n-1` queries.
  - Therefore, the total number of queries is at most `3n-3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Correctness of Logic:**
  - The first loop correctly finds an index `ans1` such that `p_ans1` is the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly finds a set of indices `v` that are candidates for the maximum XOR with `p_ans1`.
  - The third loop correctly finds the index `ans` from the set `v` that maximizes `p_ans \oplus p_ans1`.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n = 2` correctly, as it will output `! 0 1` or `! 1 0`, which are both valid answers.
  - The program also handles the case where multiple pairs of indices have the same maximum XOR value by returning any one of them.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and adheres to the problem constraints. It correctly finds a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value and does so within the allowed number of queries.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
