Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it stop being beautiful. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program and its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current segment of identical elements.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array to keep track of the current segment's value.
   - `minn` is initialized to `inf` to store the minimum length of any segment of identical elements found.

3. **Segment Length Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`, it increments `same`.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is different from `num`, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, resets `same` to 1, and updates `num` to the new element.
   - The loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last segment.
   - If `minn` is still `inf` or if `minn` is equal to the length of the array, it prints `-1` (indicating that it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements).
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Incorrect Update of `num` and `i`**:
  - The line `i += 1` before updating `num` and `same` is incorrect. This causes the program to skip the next element in the array, leading to potential errors.
  - The correct approach should be to update `num` and `same` and then increment `i`.

- **Handling Uniform Arrays**:
  - The program correctly handles uniform arrays by checking if `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of the array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = float('inf')
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                num = ar[i]
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == float('inf') or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Explanation:
- **Correct Update of `num` and `i`**:
  - The line `i += 1` is now correctly placed at the end of the while loop, ensuring that the program does not skip elements.
  - This change ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive segments of identical elements.

- **Final Check**:
  - The final check for `minn` being `inf` or equal to the length of the array is correct and ensures that the program handles uniform arrays and arrays with no valid segments properly.

### Conclusion:
The original program had a logical error in the way it updated `num` and `i`, which could lead to incorrect results. After correcting this, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **False** (due to the logical error in the original program). However, the corrected program is **True**.
