#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and each tuple represents an edge in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node from 1 to n, and the value is a list of all nodes directly connected to the key node by an edge. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing edges in a tree), and `start` (an integer between 1 and n representing the starting node). It constructs a tree from the given edges, identifies the leaves of the tree, and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the starting node to two different leaves. Based on the parity of the distances found, it returns 'Ron' if either distance is even, and 'Hermione' if both distances are odd. The input parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged.
