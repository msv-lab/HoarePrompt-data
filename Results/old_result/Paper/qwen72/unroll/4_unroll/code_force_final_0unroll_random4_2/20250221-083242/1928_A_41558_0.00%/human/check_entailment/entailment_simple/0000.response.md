Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are odd. If they are, Bob cannot form another rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will result in non-integer dimensions, and thus, the function prints 'NO'. This is correct based on the problem description.

3. **Equal Halves Check**: The second condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`). If this is the case, Bob can only form the same rectangle by cutting it, and thus, the function prints 'NO'. This is also correct based on the problem description.

4. **Other Cases**: If neither of the above conditions is met, Bob can form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle and rearranging the pieces. The function prints 'YES' in this case. This is correct because:
   - If one dimension is even, Bob can cut it into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are even, Bob can cut either dimension into two equal parts and form a different rectangle.
   - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can still cut the even dimension and form a different rectangle.

However, there is a minor issue in the program:
- The condition `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` should use integer division (`//`) instead of floating-point division (`/`). This is because the problem specifies that the sides of the rectangles are integers, and using floating-point division could lead to incorrect results due to precision issues.

Given this, the program is almost correct but has a potential issue with the division operation. To fix this, we should use integer division:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
            print('NO')
        elif a // 2 == b or b // 2 == a:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

With this correction, the program will be fully correct.

Correctness: **False** (due to the potential issue with floating-point division, which should be integer division).
