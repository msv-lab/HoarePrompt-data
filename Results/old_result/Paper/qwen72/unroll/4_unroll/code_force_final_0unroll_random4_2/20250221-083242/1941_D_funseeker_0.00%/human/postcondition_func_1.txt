The function `func_2` implicitly uses parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws` but does not directly manipulate them. It calls another function `func_1` and returns the integer result of that call. The specific value returned by `func_2` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided. From the user's perspective, `func_2` returns an integer. The state of the program after the function concludes remains unchanged with respect to the input parameters `n`, `m`, `x`, and `throws`.
