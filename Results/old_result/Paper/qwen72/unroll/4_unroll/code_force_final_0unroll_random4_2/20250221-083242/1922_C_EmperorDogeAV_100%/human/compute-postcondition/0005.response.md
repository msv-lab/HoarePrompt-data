The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cities` and `n`. `cities` is a list of `n` integers in strictly ascending order, where the number of cities `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `prog_cities` which contains `n-1` integers. Each integer in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city in the `cities` list, depending on the comparison of distances to the previous and next cities.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of city coordinates in strictly ascending order and the number of cities. It returns a list of `n-1` integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, based on the comparison of distances to the previous and next cities.**
