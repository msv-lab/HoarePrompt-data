The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used for iteration, and it does not need to be adjusted. However, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
