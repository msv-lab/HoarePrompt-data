The function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, the number of suffix maximums, and the lists of indices for the prefix and suffix maximums. Here is the correct function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def count_permutations(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each case in cases is a tuple (n, m_1, m_2, p, s) where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, m_1 and m_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n, p is a list of m_1 integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, and s is a list of m_2 integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
