Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100. The loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, the output is either k - 1 or n, depending on the condition max(p) >= k.**
