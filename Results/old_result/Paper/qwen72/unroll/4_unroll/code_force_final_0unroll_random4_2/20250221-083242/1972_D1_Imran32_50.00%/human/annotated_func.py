#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is not correctly defined for the given problem. The function should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
        
    #State: `n` and `k` retain their initial values, `ans` is updated to `ans + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, root + 1))`, and `root` remains equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the initial value of ans and the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for each i in the range from 2 to root + 1, and root is int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input, and calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of the initial value of `n` and the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each integer `i` in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. It then prints the final value of `ans`. The function does not return any value. The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial values after the function call.
