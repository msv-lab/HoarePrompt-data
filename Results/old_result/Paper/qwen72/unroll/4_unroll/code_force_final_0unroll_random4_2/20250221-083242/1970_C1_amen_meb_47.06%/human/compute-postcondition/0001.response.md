For the `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will execute at least once regardless of the program state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the program state for the first iteration of the loop to proceed.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the function implicitly works with a tree structure that has exactly two leaves, the tree is represented by a series of edges (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the starting node for the game is an integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, and `numbers` is an empty list.**
