### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The function `make_array` is used to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values and clique assignments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `cliques` is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach to determine the number of cliques.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to arrays of zeros with length `n`.
   - The loop iterates over the range of `cliques`, and for each clique, it calls `make_array` to fill the arrays with values and clique assignments.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated to determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid` and `not_mid` are used to split the range of values into two parts.
   - The first part assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in descending order to the vertices in the current clique.
   - The second part assigns values from `big_element` to `big_element - not_mid + 1` in descending order to the vertices in the current clique.
   - The clique assignment is done by setting `cliquess[left + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to the current clique number.

5. **Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is implicitly satisfied by the way the values are assigned. The values are assigned in a way that ensures the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `arr` which contains the assigned values.
   - It prints the number of cliques.
   - It prints the array `cliquess` which contains the clique assignments.

7. **Validation:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The output for each test case matches the expected format and values.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the given constraints. The logic and implementation appear to be sound and handle the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
