Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**: The function checks if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`. If this condition is true, it prints `2`. This is correct because if `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at the same time is 2 (one from each installation).

3. **Calculation for Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**: If `m` is not less than either `a` or `b`, the function calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints the result. This calculation is intended to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. However, this calculation is incorrect.

   - The expression `m // a` calculates how many times the first installation can launch a firework within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes.
   - Similarly, `m // b` calculates how many times the second installation can launch a firework within the same window.
   - Adding 2 to the sum of these two values is intended to account for the initial launches from both installations, but this is not the correct approach.

4. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The correct approach to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM gives the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - The maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is the number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility window of `m + 1` minutes, plus any additional fireworks that might be visible due to the overlap of the visibility windows.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the test case `6 7 4`, the function correctly prints `2` because `m` is less than both `a` and `b`.
   - For the test case `3 4 10`, the function prints `7`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `4` because the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is 4 (at time 12, for example).
   - For the test case `7 8 56`, the function prints `17`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `17` because the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is indeed 17 (at time 56, for example).

6. **Conclusion**: The function's logic for calculating the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks is flawed. It does not correctly account for the overlap of visibility windows and the LCM of `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **False**
