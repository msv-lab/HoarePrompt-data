Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing `s` with its reverse `s[::-1]`.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and behaves as expected based on the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input and processes it to determine if it can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - The function first checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "1", and the original string `s` and returns.
     - This is correct because if the string itself is not a palindrome, it can be considered as a valid partition with one part.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO" and returns.
     - This is correct because if all characters in the string are the same, every possible substring will also be a palindrome, making it impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
     - This is correct because it ensures that both substrings are non-palindromic.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks additional conditions:
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO".
       - This is incorrect because it does not always ensure that the partition is impossible. For example, if `s` is "abccba" and `x` is 1, the function should still be able to find a valid partition.
       - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, it prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
       - This is correct because it ensures that both substrings are non-palindromic.

3. **Issues with `func_2`**:
   - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2` is too restrictive and can lead to incorrect "NO" outputs in some cases.
   - For example, if `s` is "abccba" and `x` is 1, the function should still be able to find a valid partition such as "ab" and "ccba".

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_2` has a logical error in the condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2`, which can cause it to incorrectly print "NO" in some valid cases.

Correctness: **False**
