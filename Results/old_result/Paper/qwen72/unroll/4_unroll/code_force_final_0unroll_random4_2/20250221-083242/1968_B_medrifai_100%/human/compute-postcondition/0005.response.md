The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. `a` and `b` are binary strings, and `i` and `j` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= i <= len(a)` and `0 <= j <= len(b)`. 

- Case_1: If the character `a[i]` is found in the substring `b[j:]`, the function returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.
- Case_2: If the character `a[i]` is not found in the substring `b[j:]`, the function returns `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`, and return the position in `b` where `a[i]` first occurs in the substring `b[j:]`, or `-1` if `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`.
