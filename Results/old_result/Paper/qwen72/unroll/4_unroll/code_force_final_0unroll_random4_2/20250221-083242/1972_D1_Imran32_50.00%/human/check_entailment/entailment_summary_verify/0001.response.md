### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each.
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - It reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) from input.
     - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
     - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates `cnt` as \(i \times i\).
     - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\) to it.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Logical Errors:**
   - The function `func_1` reads \(k\) but does not use it in any calculations. This suggests that the function is not correctly addressing the problem, which involves both \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to be related to the problem's conditions. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not being checked or used in the calculations.
   - The loop and the update to `ans` do not align with the problem's requirements. The loop is iterating over the square root of \(n\) and updating `ans` in a way that does not correspond to the problem's constraints.

4. **Correctness:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and does not use the second input \(m\) in any meaningful way.
   - The function `func_1` is fundamentally incorrect in its approach to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It fails to use the second input \(m\) and does not check the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Final: **False**
