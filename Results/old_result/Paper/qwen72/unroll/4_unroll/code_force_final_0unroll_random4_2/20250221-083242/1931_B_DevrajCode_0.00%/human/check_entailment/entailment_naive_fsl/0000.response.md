Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly as specified in the problem description. The input is read all at once and processed as a single test case, which is incorrect. The program should read and process each test case individually.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Input:
```
6
1
43
2
1 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
3
1 2 3
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
No
```

The program reads all the input at once and processes it as a single test case, leading to incorrect results. It should handle each test case separately.
