### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input, which are expected to be in non-decreasing order.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed in a win/loss or 2 points being distributed in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because an odd total sum of points is impossible to achieve with the given scoring rules.

3. **Calculate Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have earned without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` must have won all the games, and any additional points would have to come from draws.
     - Subtracting this value from the total points gives the number of points that must have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 (since each draw results in 2 points) gives the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), which results in `0` draws. This is correct.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`), which results in `-1`. This is correct because the total points are odd.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the total points are 4, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (two games ended in draws), so the output is `2`. This is correct.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the total points are 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1`. This is correct.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the total points are 12, and the maximum number of draws is 6 (six games ended in draws), so the output is `6`. This is correct.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the total points are 12, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (two games ended in draws), so the output is `2`. This is correct.

5. **Verification of the Formula:**
   - The formula `result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2` is derived from the problem constraints and is mathematically sound.
   - It ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly by accounting for the points that could have been earned without any draws and then distributing the remaining points as draws.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
