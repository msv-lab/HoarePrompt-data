Output State: **The function `func` will have processed all test cases, each with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. For each test case, the loop will have printed the result of the formula `res = sum((i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i in range(n))` followed by `n << 1` (which is `n * 2`). Additionally, for each `i` from `n` to `1` in descending order, the loop will have printed two lines: '1 i' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, and '2 i' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`. The loop will have completed all iterations, and the function will be ready to process the next test case or terminate if there are no more test cases.**
