Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. The function attempts to handle a specific case where `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` by returning 0, which is not a general solution and does not follow the problem description for all cases.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
6 6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
According to the problem description, Alice can remove up to 6 elements, and Bob can multiply up to 3 elements by -1. The optimal strategy for Alice is to remove all elements, resulting in a sum of 0. However, the program will return 0 due to the specific condition in `func_2`, which is not a general solution.

Another issue is the way the function handles the removal and negation of elements. The logic for calculating the sum after Bob's negations is not correct. The function should consider the smallest elements for negation and the largest elements for removal to achieve the optimal sum. The current implementation does not correctly handle these scenarios, leading to incorrect results for many test cases.
