Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if the array `a` can be transformed into a non-decreasing sorted array by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates the array `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`, which allows us to check all possible rotations of the array.
   - It iterates through the `concatenated_a` and checks if any subarray of length `n` (the original length of `a`) matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be sorted by the described operation. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index `idx` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

The logic in `func_1` is correct because it effectively checks all possible rotations of the array to see if any of them match the sorted version of the array. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and follows the problem's input format.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
