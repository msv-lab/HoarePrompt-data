### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `a` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, it is always possible to achieve this by simply adding `c` cubes one by one. Therefore, the output should be "YES".
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes because you can't add more cubes than the number of moves you have. Therefore, the output should be "NO".
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If the parity (odd or even) of `b` and `c` is the same, it is possible to achieve `c` cubes. This is because you can add and remove cubes in such a way that the final number of cubes matches the desired number. For example, if `b` is even and `c` is even, you can add `c` cubes and then remove the remaining cubes to make the total moves `b`. Similarly, if both are odd, you can achieve the same.
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If the parity of `b` and `c` is different, it is impossible to achieve `c` cubes. This is because the number of cubes added or removed must always result in a number of cubes that has the same parity as the initial number of cubes (which is 0, an even number).

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "YES" or "NO" based on the conditions described above.
   - The output is case-insensitive, so "Yes" and "No" are acceptable.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem.
- It ensures that the output is "Yes" or "No" based on the parity and the relationship between `b` and `c`.
- The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
