The function `func` does not appear to accept any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, the output is dependent on two variables, `t` and `n`, which are integers with specific constraints (1 <= t <= 50 and 1 <= n <= 50). Since these variables are not passed as parameters, they might be defined within the function or used in a context external to the function. The function's output is not specified, but it is implied that the function returns a value or values based on the constraints of `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function operates based on predefined or contextually defined integers `t` and `n` within the range 1 to 50. The exact output is not specified, but it is determined by the values of `t` and `n`.**
