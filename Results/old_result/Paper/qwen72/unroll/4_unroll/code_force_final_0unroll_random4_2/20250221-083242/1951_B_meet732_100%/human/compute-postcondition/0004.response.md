Output State: **`a` remains a list of n integers where each integer a_i represents the Cowdeforces rating of cow i, with all a_i being distinct. `x` is equal to `a[k]`, where `a[k]` is the Cowdeforces rating of the k-th cow. `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`. `c` is 2 if there are at least two elements in `a` greater than `x`, otherwise `c` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than `x` (which could be 0, 1, or 2).**
