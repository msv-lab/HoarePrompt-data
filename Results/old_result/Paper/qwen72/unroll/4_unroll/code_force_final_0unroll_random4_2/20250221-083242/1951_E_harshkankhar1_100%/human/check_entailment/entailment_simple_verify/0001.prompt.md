You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(s) -> bool`**
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single part that is not a palindrome.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find a non-palindromic partition:
     - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
     - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, making all substrings palindromes.
     - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome.
       - If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition of the string into two parts: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
       - This is correct because the first part is guaranteed to be non-palindromic (since it contains at least one different character), and the second part is also non-palindromic.
     - If the substring from `x + 1` to the end is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
       - This is incorrect. The condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is too restrictive and does not cover all cases where a non-palindromic partition is possible.
     - If the above conditions are not met, it prints "YES" and the partition of the string into two parts: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
       - This is correct because the first part `s[:x + 2]` will contain at least two different characters, making it non-palindromic, and the second part will also be non-palindromic.

### Issues:
- The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is too restrictive. For example, if the string is "abccba" and `x` is 1, the function incorrectly prints "NO" even though a valid partition exists (e.g., "ab" and "ccba").

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct due to the restrictive condition in the `elif` statement.

### Correctness: **False**
