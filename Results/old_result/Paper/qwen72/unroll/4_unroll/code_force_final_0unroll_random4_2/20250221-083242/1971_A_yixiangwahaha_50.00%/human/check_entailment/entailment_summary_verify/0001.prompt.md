You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases, and then reads 10 pairs of integers (x, y) for each test case. It stores these integers in two lists, `x` and `y`. After reading the inputs, the function prints the pairs of integers from `x` and `y` for each index `i` from 0 to 9, ensuring that the smaller integer is printed first followed by the larger integer. The function does not return any value, and the lists `x` and `y` are not modified after the printing. The initial input integer `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, from the input. However, it does not use `t` in the subsequent loop, which is a potential issue. The loop always runs 10 times, regardless of the value of `t`. This is incorrect because the number of test cases should control the loop.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads two integers `x` and `y` for each test case and appends them to the lists `x` and `y`. This part is correct, but it should be controlled by the number of test cases `t`, not a fixed 10.

3. **Output**: The program then prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. This part is logically correct, as it correctly determines and prints the minimum and maximum values.

4. **Fixed Loop Issue**: The loop that reads the test cases should run `t` times, not 10 times. This is a critical error because it will either read too many or too few test cases depending on the value of `t`.

5. **Correct Loop**: The loop should be modified to:
   ```python
   for i in range(int(t)):
   ```

Given the issues, the program is incorrect because it does not handle the number of test cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
