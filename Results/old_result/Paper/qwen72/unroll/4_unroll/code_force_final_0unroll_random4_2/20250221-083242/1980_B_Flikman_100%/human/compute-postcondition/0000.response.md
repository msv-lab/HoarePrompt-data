The value of `t` is updated based on the new input provided by `int(input())`. The other variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The new value of `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n`, `f`, and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
