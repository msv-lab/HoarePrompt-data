Reasoning:  
The program aims to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The function `func_1` constructs the string by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times. However, this approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` will be subsequences of `s`.

For example, consider the case where `n = 2` and `k = 3`. The function will return the string `abcbac`. While this string contains all possible subsequences of length 2 formed by the characters `a`, `b`, and `c`, it is not the optimal solution in terms of length. A shorter string that satisfies the condition is `abcabc`, which is 6 characters long, whereas the function returns a string that is 6 characters long but is not necessarily the optimal one.

To ensure correctness, the string `s` should be constructed in such a way that it contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets, and the length of `s` should be minimized. The current approach does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
