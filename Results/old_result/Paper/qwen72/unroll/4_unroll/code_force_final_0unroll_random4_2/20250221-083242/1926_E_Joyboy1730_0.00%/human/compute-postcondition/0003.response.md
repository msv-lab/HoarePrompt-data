The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the example.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 50,000, and `n` and `k` are integers such that `k` is between 1 and `n`, and `n` is between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided.**
