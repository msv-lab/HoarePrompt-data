Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in calculating the extra screens required for the 1x1 applications. Specifically, the calculation of `extra_screen` should consider the total number of 1x1 applications that still need to be placed, not just the `extra_space` which is the number of 1x1 applications that couldn't fit in the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 applications.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 applications
        screen_require_for_y = (y * 4 + 14) // 15  # Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 applications (12 cells)
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - y * 4  # Remaining cells after placing 2x2 applications
        if x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_screen = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15  # Calculate additional screens needed for 1x1 applications
            result.append(screen_require_for_y + extra_screen)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Applications:**
   - Each screen can hold up to 3 2x2 applications, which occupy 12 cells.
   - The formula `(y * 4 + 14) // 15` ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number of screens required to fit all 2x2 applications.

2. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - After placing the 2x2 applications, we calculate the remaining cells on these screens.

3. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Applications:**
   - If the number of 1x1 applications (`x`) can fit into the remaining cells, we use the same number of screens.
   - If not, we calculate the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 applications using the formula `(x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15`.

This corrected version should accurately determine the minimum number of screens required for the given inputs.
