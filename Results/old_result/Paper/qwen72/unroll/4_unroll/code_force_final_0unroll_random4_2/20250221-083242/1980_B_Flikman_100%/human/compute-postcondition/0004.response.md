Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks if the `k` largest elements in the list `a` include all occurrences of the value at index `f-1` in `a`. If all occurrences are included, it prints 'YES'. If none of the occurrences are included, it prints 'NO'. If some but not all occurrences are included, it prints 'MAYBE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` from the last test case remain in memory. **
