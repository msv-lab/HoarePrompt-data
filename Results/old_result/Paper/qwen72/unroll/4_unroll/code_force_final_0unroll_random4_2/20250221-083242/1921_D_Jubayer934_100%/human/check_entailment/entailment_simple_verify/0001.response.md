### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, which represent the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order.
   - This sorting is done to maximize the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`.
   - This is a valid approach because pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` generally maximizes the differences.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted `b` array and calculates the absolute differences with the corresponding elements of `a`.
   - These differences are stored in the list `ans`.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Optimization Check**:
   - The function checks if there is a point where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the smallest element of `b` that hasn't been used yet) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (the largest element of `b` that hasn't been used yet).
   - If such a point is found, it breaks the loop and stores the index `temp`.
   - This check is intended to optimize the differences by potentially using the smallest elements of `b` for the remaining elements of `a`.
   - However, the logic here is flawed. The function should not break the loop and store the index `temp` as soon as it finds a single element where the difference with the smallest unused element of `b` is greater. Instead, it should continue to check all elements and then decide the optimal way to pair them.

5. **Adjusting Differences**:
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means there was a point where the smaller elements of `b` can provide a larger difference.
   - The function then iterates from `temp` to `n` and appends the differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to `ans`.
   - This part is also flawed. The function should not just switch to using the smallest elements of `b` from the `temp` index onwards. It should instead calculate the differences for all possible pairs and choose the maximum.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.
   - This part is correct, but the values in `ans` might not be optimal due to the flaws in the optimization check and adjusting differences.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is a good initial step to maximize differences.
  - However, the optimization logic is incorrect.

- **Initial Differences**:
  - The initial differences are calculated correctly by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`.

- **Optimization**:
  - The function's approach to optimization is flawed. It should not break the loop and switch to using the smallest elements of `b` based on a single comparison.
  - Instead, it should calculate the differences for all possible pairs and choose the maximum difference for each element of `a`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where `m = n` correctly by using the first `n` elements of `b`.
  - It also handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same, which would result in a zero difference if all elements in `a` are the same.
  - However, it does not handle the optimization correctly, which can lead to incorrect results in other cases.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference `D` due to the flawed optimization check and adjusting differences. The approach is not sound and can produce incorrect results for valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
