Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a string `s` of length `m` (where `m` is provided but not explicitly used in the function). The function checks if the string `s` contains all possible combinations of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets at least `n` times. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the missing combination to reach `n` occurrences. The function repeats this process for `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer provided at the beginning of the function call. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. **
