You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: elements is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. removals and negatives are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements).
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements). `pos` is a list with `removals + 1` elements, where the last element is `s - 2 * s2`, and `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which has `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed. The other elements in `pos` are not specified but are part of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos` that has `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which has `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed. The other elements in `pos` are not specified but are part of the list.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
