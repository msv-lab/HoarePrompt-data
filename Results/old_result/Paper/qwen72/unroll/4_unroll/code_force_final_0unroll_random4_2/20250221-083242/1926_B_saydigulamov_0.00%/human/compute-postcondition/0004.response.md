Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) and then `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The function counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1'. If the number of '1's in the first two rows is the same, it prints the list `k` containing these counts. The function does not return any value; it only prints the list `k` for qualifying test cases. The variable `a` remains unchanged after the function concludes. **
