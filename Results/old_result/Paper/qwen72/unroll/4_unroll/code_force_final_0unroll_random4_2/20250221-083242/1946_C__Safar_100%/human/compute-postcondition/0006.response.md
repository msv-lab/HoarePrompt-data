To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `l` and `r`.

Given:
- `l` is 1
- `r` is `n // k`

The loop condition is `l <= r`. For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Let's break it down:
- `l` is 1, which is a fixed value.
- `r` is `n // k`, which means `r` is the integer division of `n` by `k`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `r` must be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, `n // k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

To ensure `n // k` is at least 1:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is at least `k`.

State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and each list at index `b` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `b` by an edge. `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. `k` remains unchanged. `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k`**
