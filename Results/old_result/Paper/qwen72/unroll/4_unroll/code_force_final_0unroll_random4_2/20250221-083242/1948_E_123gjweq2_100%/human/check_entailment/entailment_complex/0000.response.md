### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \le n \le 40\) and \(1 \le k \le 2n\).
   - **Output**:
     - The first line should contain `n` distinct integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) (1 \le a_i \le n).
     - The second line should contain the number of cliques `q` (1 \le q \le n).
     - The third line should contain `n` integers \(c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n\) (1 \le c_i \le q) representing the partition of the graph into cliques.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - **Input**: `left`, `right`, and `clique` are integers where `left` and `right` are non-negative and `left <= right`. `clique` is a positive integer.
   - **Output**:
     - The subarray `arr[left:right + 1]` is filled with values in a specific pattern.
     - The subarray `cliquess[left:right + 1]` is filled with the value `clique`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Clique Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because the maximum number of vertices that can be in a single clique is `k`, and the minimum number of cliques required is the ceiling of `n / k`.
   - **Array Filling**:
     - The function `make_array` is called to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
     - The function `make_array` divides the subarray `arr[left:right + 1]` into two parts:
       - The first part is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
       - The second part is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
     - The `cliquess` array is filled with the value `clique` for the entire subarray.
   - **Output**:
     - The function `func_1` prints the `arr` array, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.
     - The `cliquess` array is printed as `n` zeros, which is incorrect because it should represent the partition of the graph into cliques.

4. **Issues**:
   - The `cliquess` array is not correctly filled with the clique numbers. It remains a list of `n` zeros, which does not meet the problem requirements.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly partition the graph into cliques as required by the problem. The `cliquess` array should contain the clique numbers for each vertex, but it is printed as all zeros. This is a clear violation of the problem's output requirements.
