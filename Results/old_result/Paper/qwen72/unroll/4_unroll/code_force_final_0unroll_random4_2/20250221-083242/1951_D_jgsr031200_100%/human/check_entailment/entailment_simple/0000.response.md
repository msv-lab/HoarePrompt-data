Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.
   - The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1 coin, which ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This is correct because Alice will buy all `k` jewels from the single stall with 1 coin each, and she will have 0 coins left, which is valid.

2. **Handling `n < k`**:
   - If `n` is less than `k`, the program prints "NO" and returns. This is correct because it is impossible for Alice to buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Setting Up Stalls**:
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It then iterates over the `costs` list, calculating how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updating `n` and `h` accordingly.
   - The loop ensures that `h` is the total number of jewels Alice can buy from the stalls with the given prices.
   - After the loop, the program checks if `h` is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy the required number of jewels. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm is designed to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 2 stalls with specific prices.
   - The first stall price is `n - k + 1`, which ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible from this stall without exceeding `k` jewels.
   - The second stall price is `1`, which ensures that Alice can buy the remaining jewels needed to reach `k` from this stall.
   - The loop correctly calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updates the remaining coins `n` and the total jewels bought `h`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is equal to `k` by setting up a single stall with a price of 1 coin.
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by printing "NO".
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 2, which is within the limit of 60 stalls.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
