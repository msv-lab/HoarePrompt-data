The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is the number of test cases, and `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
