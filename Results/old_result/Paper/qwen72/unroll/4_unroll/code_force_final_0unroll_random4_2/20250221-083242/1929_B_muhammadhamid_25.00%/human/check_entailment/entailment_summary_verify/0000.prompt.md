You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple pairs of integers (n, k) provided through standard input. For each pair, it prints a value based on the conditions: if k is 1, it prints 1; if k is less than or equal to 2 * n, it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2; otherwise, it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes, and the program state is unchanged except for the printed output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \) correctly. According to the problem description, if \( k \) is \( 2n \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( n \). However, the program prints \( \math.ceil(k / 2) \), which is \( n \) when \( k = 2n \), but this logic is not explicitly clear and might be incorrect for other values of \( k \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 6
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 6 \). The correct output should be 3, because all 6 diagonals can be covered by coloring 3 cells (one cell on each row and column). However, the program will output:
```
3
```
which is correct for this specific case, but the logic used is not robust and might fail for other inputs.

To illustrate a more clear failure, consider the input:
```
1
4 8
```
Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 8 \). The correct output should be 4, but the program will output:
```
4
```
which is correct, but the logic is not clear and might fail for other inputs. For instance, if \( k = 7 \) and \( n = 4 \), the program will output:
```
4
```
which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3, as it is possible to color 3 cells to cover 7 diagonals.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
