Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `r`, and `visited` are lists of length `n` with all elements unchanged. `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `0`, and `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to `1`. `nodes` is an empty list. If there is at least one element in `nodes` for which `c1` is not `0`, `ok` is `True`. Otherwise, `ok` is `False`.***
