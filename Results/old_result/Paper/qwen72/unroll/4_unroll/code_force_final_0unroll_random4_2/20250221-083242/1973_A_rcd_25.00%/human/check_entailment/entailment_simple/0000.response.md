### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Validation:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum of Scores Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/lose scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If the sum of the scores is even, the program then checks if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2` (the two lower scores). If it is, it prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is because the highest score can be achieved by winning all games against the other two players, and the other two players can only draw with each other.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program enters a more complex calculation to determine the maximum number of draws. It sets `low` and `high` to the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p2`, respectively.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur` is less than or equal to `p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If such a value is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such value is found, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`).
   - It also correctly handles the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`).

5. **Complexity:**
   - The program's logic is sound, but the while loop might be unnecessary. The maximum number of draws can be determined more straightforwardly by considering the constraints and the properties of the scores.

### Simplified Logic:
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated as follows:
  - If the sum of the scores is odd, return `-1`.
  - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.
  - Otherwise, the maximum number of draws is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2 - p3`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is correct, but it can be simplified. However, the current implementation does handle all the given test cases correctly.
