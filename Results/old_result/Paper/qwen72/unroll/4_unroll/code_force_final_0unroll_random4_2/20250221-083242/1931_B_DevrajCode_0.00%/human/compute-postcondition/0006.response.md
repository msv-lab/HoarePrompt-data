The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element, and `water` should be set to the first element of the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5)
- `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n
- `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`
- `total_water % n == 0`
- `target = total_water // n`
- `container` is 0

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect the conditions at the start of the first iteration of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target = total_water // n`, `container` is 0, `a` must have at least 1 element, `water` is the first element in the list `a`**
