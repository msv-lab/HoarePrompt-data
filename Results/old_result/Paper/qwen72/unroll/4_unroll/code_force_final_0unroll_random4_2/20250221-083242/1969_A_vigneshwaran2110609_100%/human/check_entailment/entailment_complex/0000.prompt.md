Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. However, the function definition provided does not include parameters for the input values, which are necessary to solve the problem as described.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. If for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`, `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, the loop prints `2` and breaks. Otherwise, after completing the inner loop, it prints `3`. The variables `x`, `l`, and `flag` are updated within the loop, but their final values are not predictable without the specific inputs. The loop does not modify `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It checks if there is any index `i` in the range `[0, x)` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop for that test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3` after completing the loop. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input `n`. The final state of the program includes `n` lines of output, each containing either `2` or `3` depending on the input for each test case.
