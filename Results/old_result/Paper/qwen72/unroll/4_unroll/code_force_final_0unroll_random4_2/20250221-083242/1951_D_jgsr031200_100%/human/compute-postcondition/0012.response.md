To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`. The loop will iterate over each element in the `costs` list, so for the loop to execute, `costs` must contain at least one element. Given the state before the loop, `costs` is already defined as a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once.

However, the state of `i` needs to be considered. At the start of the loop, `i` will be set to the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.

So, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`. `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
