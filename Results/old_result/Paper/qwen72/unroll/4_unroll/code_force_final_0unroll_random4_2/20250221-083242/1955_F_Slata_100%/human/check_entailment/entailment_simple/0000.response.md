### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is associative and commutative.

3. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (e.g., two 1s, two 2s) does not change the XOR of the sequence.
   - Removing a single number can change the XOR from zero to non-zero or vice versa.

5. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` counts the number of pairs of each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4).
   - Each pair of numbers (e.g., two 1s) can be removed without changing the XOR.
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if the sum of the remainders of `a`, `b`, and `c` when divided by 2 is 3. This condition is true if there are exactly three odd counts among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

6. **Explanation of the Expression**:
   - `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` count the number of pairs of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s, respectively.
   - Removing these pairs does not change the XOR.
   - The term `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` adds 1 to the result if there are exactly three odd counts among `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is because if there are three odd counts, removing one of these numbers will make the total XOR zero, allowing Bob to win.

7. **Verification with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `1 1 1 0`
     - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
     - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (True)
     - Result: `0 + 1 = 1`
   - **Example 2**: `1 0 1 2`
     - Pairs: `0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`
     - Odd counts: `1 + 0 + 1 = 2` (False)
     - Result: `1 + 0 = 1`
   - **Example 3**: `2 2 2 0`
     - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Odd counts: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (False)
     - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - **Example 4**: `3 3 2 0`
     - Pairs: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
     - Odd counts: `1 + 1 + 0 = 2` (False)
     - Result: `3 + 0 = 3`
   - **Example 5**: `0 9 9 9`
     - Pairs: `0 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 12`
     - Odd counts: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (False)
     - Result: `12 + 0 = 12`

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` accurately calculates the number of Bob's wins based on the problem's constraints and the properties of the XOR operation.

Correctness: **True**
