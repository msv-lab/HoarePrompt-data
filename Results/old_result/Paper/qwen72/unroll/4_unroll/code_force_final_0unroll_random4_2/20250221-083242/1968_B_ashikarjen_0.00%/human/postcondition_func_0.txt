The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.
