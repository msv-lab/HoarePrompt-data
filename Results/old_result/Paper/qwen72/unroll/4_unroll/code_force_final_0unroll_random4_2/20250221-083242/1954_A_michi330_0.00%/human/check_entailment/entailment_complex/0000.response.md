Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case. Each test case is read as three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the standard input, which is appropriate for the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - The first condition `n <= k` checks if the number of parts `n` is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint `k`. If this is true, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the function correctly prints 'NO'.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is more complex. It checks if the number of parts that are not forced to be the same color by Alice's initial painting is less than the number of parts Bob can repaint. If this is true, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the function correctly prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the function prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is derived from the idea that if Alice paints the ribbon using `m` colors, the minimum number of parts that will have the same color is `math.ceil(n / m)`. If Bob can repaint `k` parts, and `k` is greater than the number of parts that are not forced to be the same color (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`), then Bob can always make all parts the same color.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n == 1` or `m == 1`, by ensuring that the conditions are evaluated properly.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints 'Yes' or 'NO' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
