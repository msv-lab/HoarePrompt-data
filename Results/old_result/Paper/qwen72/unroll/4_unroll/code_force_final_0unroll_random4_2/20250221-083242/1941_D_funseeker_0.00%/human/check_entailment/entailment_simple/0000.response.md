### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read input lines and `func_3()` to parse the first line of each test case into integers `n`, `m`, and `x`.
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - For each test case, the initial set `ans` is set to contain only the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates `m` times, each time reading a throw distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - For each possible current player `q` in `ans`:
     - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the result of moving `r` steps clockwise to `temp`.
     - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the result of moving `r` steps counterclockwise to `temp`.
   - The `ans` set is then updated to `temp`.

4. **Adjusting for Player Numbering:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the `ans` set. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This adjustment is necessary because player numbers are 1-indexed, and the modulo operation can result in `0` which should be interpreted as `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Potential Issues:
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` can result in `0`, which should be adjusted to `n` to match the 1-indexed player numbers. The program correctly handles this by checking if `0` is in the set and replacing it with `n`.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The use of sets to store possible player positions is appropriate because it ensures that each player number is unique and avoids duplicates.

- **Direction Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles all three possible directions ('0', '1', '?') by adding both clockwise and counterclockwise positions when the direction is unknown.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where `n` is small or large, and `m` is small or large, as long as the constraints are met.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws, given the initial player `x` and the distances and directions of the throws. The input and output handling is also correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
