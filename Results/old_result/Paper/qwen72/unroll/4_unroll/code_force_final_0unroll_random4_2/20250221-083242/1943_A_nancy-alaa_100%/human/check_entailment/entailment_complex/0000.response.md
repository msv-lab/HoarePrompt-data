Reasoning:

The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game where they take turns removing elements from an array `a` and Alice appends her chosen elements to a new array `c`. The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it. Both players play optimally.

The provided program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) to determine the MEX of the final array `c`. The logic is as follows:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr`.
3. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
4. **Finding MEX**:
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
   - If an integer `i` is not present in the `Counter` (i.e., `i` is not in `arr`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop. This is because `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `arr`, and thus the MEX.
   - If an integer `i` is present in the `Counter` and appears exactly once, and if `first` is `True`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop. The variable `first` is used to track whether a unique integer has been encountered.
   - If an integer `i` is present and appears exactly once, it sets `first` to `True`.

The key points to verify for correctness are:
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop.
- **Counting Elements**: The `Counter` is used correctly to count the occurrences of each element.
- **Finding MEX**: The logic for finding the MEX is correct. The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is either not present in `arr` or appears exactly once after the first unique integer has been encountered.

However, there is a subtle issue in the logic:
- The program should ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally. The current logic does not explicitly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it directly finds the MEX based on the presence and count of elements in `arr`.

Given the problem constraints and the optimal play assumption, the MEX of `c` can be determined by the following optimal strategy:
- Alice will always pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and appears at least once in `a`.
- Bob will always pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` and appears at least once in `a`.

This means the MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that is not present in `a` or appears exactly once after the first unique integer has been encountered. The current program correctly implements this logic.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
