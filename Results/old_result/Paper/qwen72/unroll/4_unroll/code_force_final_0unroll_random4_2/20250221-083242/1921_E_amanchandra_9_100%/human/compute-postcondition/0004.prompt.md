You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process game scenarios, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). Each of these parameters should be integers, with h and w representing the height and width of the board, respectively, and (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9 must be satisfied, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing input scenarios for Alice's and Bob's chips on a board of dimensions (r, w) with initial positions (a, b) and (c, d). For each iteration, if `a` is greater than `c`, the output is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the loop calculates the positions and determines the winner based on the conditions provided. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are reset for each iteration, and the variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. The initial values of `h`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), where h and w are the height and width of the board, and (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. It returns a result based on the game scenario defined by these parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
