The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., non-zero), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer, 1 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^7**
