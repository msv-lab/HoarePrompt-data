The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the final values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` will be those from the last test case, and `t` will remain unchanged.
