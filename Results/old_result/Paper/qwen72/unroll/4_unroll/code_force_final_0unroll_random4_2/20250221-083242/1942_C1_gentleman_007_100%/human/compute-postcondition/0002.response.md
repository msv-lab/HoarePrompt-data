Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= num; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `Lowest_Prime` with `num + 1` elements, where each element is set to `0`. The values of `num`, `prime`, and `Highest_Prime` remain unchanged.
