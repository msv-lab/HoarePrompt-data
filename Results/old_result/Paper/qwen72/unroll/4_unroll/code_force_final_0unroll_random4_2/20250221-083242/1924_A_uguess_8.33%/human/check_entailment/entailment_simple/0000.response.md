### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The program uses a bitmask `cur` to track the presence of characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in the string `s`.
   - For each character in `s`, it calculates `cur_ss` which is the index of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - It checks if the character is already present in the bitmask `cur` using `cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0`. If not, it adds the character to the bitmask.
   - If the bitmask `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence, and it increments the count `cnt` and resets `cur`.

3. **Output Logic:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES', indicating that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The string `ans` is constructed by first repeating the last character in the alphabet `k` times `cnt` times.
   - It then finds the first character that is not present in the current bitmask `cur` and appends it to `ans`.
   - Finally, it appends 'a' enough times to make the length of `ans` equal to `n`.

4. **Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - The bitmask approach is used to check if all `k` characters are present in a subsequence, but it does not ensure that all possible combinations of length `n` are checked.
   - The construction of the string `ans` is flawed. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic for checking subsequences and constructing the string `ans` is incorrect. It only checks if all `k` characters are present in a subsequence, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences. Additionally, the construction of `ans` does not ensure that the string is a valid non-occurring subsequence.
