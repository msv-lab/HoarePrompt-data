Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and each list at index `b` contains the indices of the vertices connected to vertex `b` by an edge. `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k`.**

The value of `r` is now the result of the integer division of `n` by `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
