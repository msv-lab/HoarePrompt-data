#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a string of space-separated integers from the standard input and returns a map object containing the integers obtained by converting the string. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the converted integers.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by spaces, converts each split part into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers derived from the user's input, where each integer was originally separated by spaces.
