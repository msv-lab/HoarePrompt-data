Output State: **The program returns the index of the first element in `ind` minus 1, which is the index of the first cow in `a` with a Cowdeforces rating greater than `x` (the Cowdeforces rating of the k-th cow), minus 1. Since `ind` is a list with exactly one element and the first element of `ind` is greater than `k`, the returned value is an integer that is one less than the index of the first cow in `a` with a rating greater than `x`.**
