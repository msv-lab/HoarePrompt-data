Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, as provided by the user input. The function should still take two parameters, `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are binary strings. Additionally, the function should still be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
