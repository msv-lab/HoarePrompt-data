You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each city's coordinate a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city in the `cities` list, depending on the comparison of distances to the previous and next cities.
    return prog_cities
    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city in the `cities` list, depending on the comparison of distances to the previous and next cities.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of city coordinates in strictly ascending order and the number of cities. It returns a list of `n-1` integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city, based on the comparison of distances to the previous and next cities.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers, where each integer is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and the next city in the `cities` list, depending on the comparison of distances to the previous and next cities.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
