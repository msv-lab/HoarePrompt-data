You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `t` binary strings `s` (where `s` is a string of '0's and '1's with a length between 1 and 500), the function calculates the number of adjacent character changes in `s`. If there is no increasing sequence (i.e., no '0' followed by '1') in `s`, it prints the count of adjacent changes plus one; otherwise, it prints the count of adjacent changes. After processing all `t` strings, the function completes and the value of `t` is 0, while `s` will be the last input binary string. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a binary string \( s \).
   - We need to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) such that when these pieces are rearranged, they form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string \( s \).
   - It initializes two variables: `count` to keep track of the number of pieces and `flag` to check if the string is already sorted.

3. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program iterates through the string \( s \) from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - It checks if the current character \( s[i] \) is different from the next character \( s[i+1] \). If they are different, it increments `count`.
   - It also checks if the current character \( s[i] \) is less than the next character \( s[i+1] \). If this condition is true, it sets `flag` to 1, indicating that the string is not already sorted.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - If `flag` is 0, it means the string is already sorted, and the program prints `count + 1`.
   - If `flag` is 1, it means the string is not sorted, and the program prints `count`.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of transitions between '0' and '1' in the string, which is stored in `count`.
   - However, the output logic is flawed:
     - If the string is already sorted, the number of pieces needed is 1, not `count + 1`.
     - If the string is not sorted, the number of pieces needed is `count + 1`, not `count`.

6. **Correct Output Logic:**
   - If the string is already sorted, the number of pieces needed is 1.
   - If the string is not sorted, the number of pieces needed is `count + 1`.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the output logic. It should print `count + 1` if the string is not sorted and 1 if the string is already sorted. The current logic incorrectly prints `count + 1` when the string is already sorted and `count` when the string is not sorted.
