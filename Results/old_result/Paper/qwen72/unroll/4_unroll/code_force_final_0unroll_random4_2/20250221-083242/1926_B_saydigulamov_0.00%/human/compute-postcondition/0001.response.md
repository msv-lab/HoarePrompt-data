To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range` loop in Python.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but it should internally handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, followed by `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'.
- The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
- The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).
- `a` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute:
- `a` must be greater than 0.
- `i` will start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
