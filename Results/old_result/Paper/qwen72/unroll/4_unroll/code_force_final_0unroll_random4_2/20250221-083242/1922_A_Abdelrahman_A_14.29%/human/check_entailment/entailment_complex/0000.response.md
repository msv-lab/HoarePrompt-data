Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly implement the conditions specified in the problem description.

1. **Initial Check for Equality**:
   - The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` and immediately prints 'NO' if this is the case. This is correct because if `c` is identical to either `a` or `b`, it cannot be the case that `a` and `b` match a template while `c` does not.

2. **Character Check**:
   - The program then iterates over each character in `c` and checks if it is not present in `a` or `b`. If such a character is found, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because the presence of a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b` does not guarantee that `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot. The correct approach should be to check if for each position `i`, the characters in `a` and `b` are the same and different from the character in `c`.

3. **Template Matching**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether for each position `i`:
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same.
     - `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) is different from `c[i]`.
   - If these conditions hold for all positions, then `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` cannot. If any position fails this condition, the answer should be 'NO'.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the existence of the template `t`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
