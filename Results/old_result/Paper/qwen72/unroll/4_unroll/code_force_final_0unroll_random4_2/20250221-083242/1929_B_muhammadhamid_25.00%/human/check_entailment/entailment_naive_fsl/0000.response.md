Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case when \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \) correctly. According to the problem description, if \( k \) is \( 2n \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( n \). However, the program prints \( \math.ceil(k / 2) \), which is \( n \) when \( k = 2n \), but this logic is not explicitly clear and might be incorrect for other values of \( k \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 6
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 6 \). The correct output should be 3, because all 6 diagonals can be covered by coloring 3 cells (one cell on each row and column). However, the program will output:
```
3
```
which is correct for this specific case, but the logic used is not robust and might fail for other inputs.

To illustrate a more clear failure, consider the input:
```
1
4 8
```
Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 8 \). The correct output should be 4, but the program will output:
```
4
```
which is correct, but the logic is not clear and might fail for other inputs. For instance, if \( k = 7 \) and \( n = 4 \), the program will output:
```
4
```
which is incorrect. The correct output should be 3, as it is possible to color 3 cells to cover 7 diagonals.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, and therefore, it is incorrect.
