You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is supposed to take two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(x, y):`.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4
        
        total_space = space_y + space_x
        
        if y % 2 == 0:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2
        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:
            result.append(screen_require_for_y)
        else:
            extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells
            if space_x % 15 == 0:
                extra_screen = space_x // 15
            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: The `result` list will contain the calculated number of screens required for each iteration, based on the input values of `x` and `y`. The length of the `result` list will be equal to `n`, and each element in the list will be an integer representing the total number of screens required for the corresponding `x` and `y` values. The values of `x` and `y` will be updated for each iteration but are not retained after the loop.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is an integer representing the number of screens required for the corresponding iteration)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept two integers, `x` and `y`, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon, and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, so it currently does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
