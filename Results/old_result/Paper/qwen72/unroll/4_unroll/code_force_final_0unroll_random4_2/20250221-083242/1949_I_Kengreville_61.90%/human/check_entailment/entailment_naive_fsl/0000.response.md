Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all disks are initially tangent to each other and the radii cannot be changed to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
0 0 1
2 0 1
1 1 1
```

In this case, the three disks are tangent to each other, and it is not possible to change the radii to strictly decrease the sum of all radii while maintaining tangency. The program, however, does not correctly detect this and might output `YES` incorrectly. The logic in the `dfs` function and the main function `func_1` does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining the tangency condition for all disks.
