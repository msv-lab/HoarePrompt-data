Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to have a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves if `n < m`. However, the program incorrectly prints "YES" when `n == m`, which is a valid case, but it does not correctly handle the case where `n < m`. For example, if the input is `1 2`, the program should output "No" because it is impossible to have a tower with 2 cubes after only 1 move. The program, however, does not explicitly check for this condition and may produce incorrect results.
