Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, `total_water` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `total_water % n == 0`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n` (i.e., `target = total_water // n`).**
