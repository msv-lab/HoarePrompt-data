Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the favorite cube will be removed or not. Specifically, the condition `if a[k] > x:` is incorrect because it assumes that if the value of the k-th cube after sorting is greater than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube will not be removed. However, this is not necessarily true because the favorite cube could still be among the first k cubes if it has the same value as other cubes that are sorted before it.

Additionally, the condition `elif a[k] < x:` is also incorrect because it assumes that if the value of the k-th cube after sorting is less than the value of the favorite cube, the favorite cube will always be removed. This is not true if the favorite cube's value is greater than or equal to the value of the k-th cube, as it could still be among the first k cubes.

The correct approach should be:
1. Sort the list in non-increasing order.
2. Check if the value of the favorite cube is among the first k cubes after sorting.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        if x in a[:k]:
            print('YES')
        elif x in a[k:]:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
```

This version correctly checks if the value of the favorite cube is among the first k cubes after sorting and handles the "MAYBE" case appropriately.
