Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum XOR value can be achieved by multiple pairs of indices. The program only selects the first pair it finds, which may not be the correct pair that maximizes the XOR value.

For example, consider the permutation `p = [0, 1, 2, 3]`:
- The maximum XOR value is `3` (since `0 ^ 3 = 3` and `1 ^ 2 = 3`).
- The program will first find `ans1 = 3` (since `0 < 3`).
- Then, it will find `mx = 0` (since `0 < 3`).
- Finally, it will print `! 0 3`.

However, the pair `(1, 2)` also achieves the maximum XOR value of `3`, and the program does not consider this pair. This means the program does not guarantee that it will find any valid pair that maximizes the XOR value, as required by the problem description.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is 2 correctly. For `n = 2`, the only possible pairs are `(0, 1)` and `(1, 0)`, and the program should always print `! 0 1` or `! 1 0`. However, the program's logic may not always produce this result, especially if the input is not handled correctly.
