Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect. For example, when `n = 2`, the correct maximum sum should be 7, but the program calculates it as 9. The issue lies in the loop where the sum is calculated:

```python
sum = 1
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
```

This formula does not correctly account for the sum of the matrix after applying the operations. Additionally, the operations themselves are not optimal for maximizing the sum. For `n = 2`, the operations should be:

```
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

But the program outputs:

```
9 4
1 1 1 2
2 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
2 2 1 2
```

This results in a matrix that does not achieve the maximum sum of 7. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
