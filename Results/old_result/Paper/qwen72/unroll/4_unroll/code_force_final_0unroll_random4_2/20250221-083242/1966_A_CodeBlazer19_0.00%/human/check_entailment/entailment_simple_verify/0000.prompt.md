You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1

    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: a list of integers `numbers` representing the numbers on the cards, an integer `n` representing the number of cards, and an integer `k` representing the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation. The input should be such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and each element in `numbers` should satisfy 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop completes, and the loop prints `k - 1` for each iteration. The variables `n`, `k`, and `l` are updated in each iteration based on the input provided during that iteration. The list `l` and the integer `n` are not used within the loop body, so their values are not relevant to the output state.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the operations. The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach. 

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `5 3` and `4 1 1 4 4`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

While the output for this specific test case is correct, the program fails for other test cases. For instance:
- Input: `7 2` and `4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `1`

However, for the test case:
- Input: `10 4` and `1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `3`

But for the test case:
- Input: `1 10` and `7`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `9`

This clearly shows that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, as it does not consider the actual numbers on the cards or the logic required to minimize the number of cards left. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
