Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. It is correctly implemented to handle input reading.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer. It is correctly implemented to handle the input for the number of test cases.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, and converts each part to an integer. It is correctly implemented to handle the input for `n`, `m`, and `x`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function processes each test case. It initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if the direction is unknown. After all throws, it adjusts the set to handle the case where the ball could be with player `0` (which should be player `n`).

   - **Initialization**: The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.
   - **Loop**: The loop correctly iterates `m` times, processing each throw.
   - **Set Updates**: The set `temp` is used to store all possible new positions after each throw. The conditions for updating `temp` are correct:
     - If the direction is `0` (clockwise) or `?` (unknown), the ball could be at `(q + r) % n`.
     - If the direction is `1` (counterclockwise) or `?` (unknown), the ball could be at `(q - r) % n`.
   - **Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment to replace `0` with `n` is necessary because player `0` does not exist in the game, and player `n` is the last player in the circle. This is correctly handled.
   - **Output**: The function correctly prints the number of possible players and the sorted list of possible players.

Given the problem description and the execution states provided, the program appears to correctly handle the game logic and produce the required output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
