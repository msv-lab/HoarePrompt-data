Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function must output a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, and 0 ≤ i, j < n. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
