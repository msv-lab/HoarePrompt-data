Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and for each test case, the output will be either 'NO' or 'Yes' based on the conditions `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` will retain their final values from the last iteration, and the loop index `itest` will be equal to `t`.**
