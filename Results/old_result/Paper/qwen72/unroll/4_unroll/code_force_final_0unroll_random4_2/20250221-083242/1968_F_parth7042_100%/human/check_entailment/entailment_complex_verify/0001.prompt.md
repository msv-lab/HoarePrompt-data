You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #State: `index` is `1 + 2 * t + 2 * (n + q)`, and `results` is a list of strings containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: 'YES' or 'NO' (each on a new line, corresponding to the elements in the `results` list)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and determines for each query whether the XOR of the elements in the specified subarray of `a` is zero or if there exists a subarray with the same XOR value that can be swapped to make the XOR zero. It prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, with each result on a new line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the `index` variable is updated to `1 + 2 * t + 2 * (n + q)`, and the `results` list contains the results of all queries.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common and efficient way to handle large inputs in competitive programming.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the input list, which is incremented as the program processes the input.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q`.

3. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - The program initializes an array `a` of size `n + 1` and a prefix XOR array `pf` of the same size.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `mp` to store the indices of each prefix XOR value.
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is computed such that `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - The dictionary `mp` is populated with the indices of each prefix XOR value.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - It computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, it means the entire subarray can be divided into parts where each part's XOR is 0, which is considered interesting. The program appends 'YES' to the results.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there exist indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the lists stored in `mp`.
   - If such indices exist, the subarray is interesting, and the program appends 'YES' to the results. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all queries for all test cases, the program prints the results.

### Analysis:
- **Prefix XOR Calculation:** The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated, and it helps in efficiently computing the XOR of any subarray.
- **Dictionary Usage:** The dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices of each prefix XOR value, which allows for quick lookups and binary search operations.
- **Query Handling:** The program correctly handles the queries by checking if the subarray XOR is 0 or if there are valid indices that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if a subarray is interesting based on the given problem description and constraints. The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the input and output as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
