Output State: `x` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `y` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `True` if there is at least one `i` for which the `dfs(i)` function populates `nodes` with indices that have non-zero `coef1` values, otherwise `ok` is `False`.
