Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly find a pair of indices \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Finding the Maximum Item**:
   - The first loop in `func_2` attempts to find the index of the maximum item in the permutation by comparing \( p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \). However, this comparison is always between the same value, which is \( p_i \). This does not help in finding the maximum item in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
   - The second loop in `func_2` attempts to find a pair with the maximum XOR by comparing \( p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \) with \( p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i \). This comparison is also flawed because it does not directly help in finding the maximum XOR. The XOR operation is not directly related to the OR operation in the way the program is structured.

3. **Query Usage**:
   - The program does not use the queries effectively to find the maximum XOR. It only uses the OR operation to compare values, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum XOR.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the maximum XOR, you need to use the queries to compare the XOR values of different pairs of indices. One possible approach is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or a binary search to find the maximum XOR value. The current program does not implement such a strategy.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to find the maximum XOR value and does not use the queries effectively. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
