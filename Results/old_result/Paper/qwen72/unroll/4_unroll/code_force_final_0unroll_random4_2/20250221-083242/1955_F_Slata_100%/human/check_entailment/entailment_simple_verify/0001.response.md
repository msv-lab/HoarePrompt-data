### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - The game ends when the sequence is empty.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve's goal is to remove numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The bitwise XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence can be paired such that each pair XORs to zero.
   - The relevant pairs are:
     - 1 XOR 1 = 0
     - 2 XOR 2 = 0
     - 3 XOR 3 = 0
     - 4 XOR 4 = 0

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the remaining sequence has an even count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) as much as possible.
   - If the count of any number is odd, Eve can remove one of that number to make it even, which will help Bob win.
   - If the count of all numbers is even, Bob wins. If the count of all numbers is odd, Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even using integer division by 2.
   - It then checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3. If it is, it adds 1 to the result, indicating that one more number can be removed to make the sequence XOR to zero.

5. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Pair Calculation:**
     - `a // 2` gives the number of pairs of 1s that can be removed.
     - `b // 2` gives the number of pairs of 2s that can be removed.
     - `c // 2` gives the number of pairs of 3s that can be removed.
     - `d // 2` gives the number of pairs of 4s that can be removed.
     - These calculations are correct and ensure that the maximum number of pairs is removed to make the counts even.

   - **Additional Check:**
     - The program checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s is 3.
     - This check is intended to determine if there are three odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s, which would allow one more number to be removed to make the sequence XOR to zero.
     - However, this check is incomplete because it does not consider the count of 4s. The count of 4s can also be odd, and removing one 4 can also help make the sequence XOR to zero.

   - **Example Verification:**
     - For the test case `1 1 1 0`:
       - `a // 2 = 0`, `b // 2 = 0`, `c // 2 = 0`, `d // 2 = 0`
       - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
       - The program prints `1`, which is correct.
     - For the test case `1 0 1 2`:
       - `a // 2 = 0`, `b // 2 = 0`, `c // 2 = 0`, `d // 2 = 1`
       - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2`
       - The program prints `1`, which is correct.
     - For the test case `2 2 2 0`:
       - `a // 2 = 1`, `b // 2 = 1`, `c // 2 = 1`, `d // 2 = 0`
       - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`
       - The program prints `3`, which is correct.
     - For the test case `3 3 2 0`:
       - `a // 2 = 1`, `b // 2 = 1`, `c // 2 = 1`, `d // 2 = 0`
       - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2`
       - The program prints `3`, which is correct.
     - For the test case `0 9 9 9`:
       - `a // 2 = 0`, `b // 2 = 4`, `c // 2 = 4`, `d // 2 = 4`
       - `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2`
       - The program prints `12`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `13` because the count of 4s is also odd, and removing one 4 can help make the sequence XOR to zero.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is generally correct in its logic and implementation for the given examples, but it fails to consider the count of 4s in the additional check.
   - This oversight can lead to incorrect results when the count of 4s is odd and the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s is not 3.
