### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n` because all ships will sink. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - The program divides the total number of attacks `k` into two parts: `a` (ceiling of `k / 2`) and `b` (floor of `k / 2`). This is because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of ships sunk.
   - It also initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to 0, which will accumulate the total durability of the ships attacked from the front and back, respectively.

4. **Loop to Simulate Attacks:**
   - The loop iterates over each ship from the front and the back simultaneously.
   - For each ship, it adds the durability to `s_a` and `s_b`.
   - If `s_a` is less than or equal to `a`, it increments `ans` because the ship from the front has been attacked enough times to sink.
   - If `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`, it increments `ans` because the ship from the back has been attacked enough times to sink.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Double Counting:**
  - The current implementation can double count a ship if both `s_a` and `s_b` are less than or equal to their respective thresholds. This is incorrect because a ship can only be sunk once.
  - For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 1]` and `k = 3`, the program will count the first and last ships as sunk, but the middle ship will also be counted as sunk twice, leading to an incorrect result.

- **Incorrect Sinking Logic:**
  - The logic for determining if a ship has sunk is flawed. The program should keep track of the remaining durability of each ship and only count a ship as sunk when its durability reaches 0.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that avoids double counting and correctly simulates the attacks:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if k >= sum(nums):
        return n
    
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                sunk += 1
                ships.popleft()
            k -= 1
        if k == 0 or not ships:
            break
        
        # Attack the last ship
        if ships[-1] > 0:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                sunk += 1
                ships.pop()
            k -= 1
    
    return sunk
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Deque Usage:**
  - A `deque` is used to efficiently pop elements from both ends of the list.
- **Attack Simulation:**
  - The program alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
  - It decrements the durability of the ship and checks if it has sunk.
  - If a ship sinks, it is removed from the deque.
  - The process continues until `k` attacks are made or all ships have sunk.

This corrected program ensures that each ship is only counted once when it sinks and correctly simulates the alternating attacks by the Kraken.
