Output State: **`n` remains the same specific integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the nodes connected to the corresponding node. Each list in `u2vs` will have at least one element, except for the last node which may or may not have connections depending on the input. `d` is the shortest distance from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph represented by `u2vs`. The second value returned by `bfs(0)` is ignored.**
