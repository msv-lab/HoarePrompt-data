Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple game scenarios. It reads an integer `t` from input, which specifies the number of scenarios to process. For each scenario, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` from input, representing the height and width of the board, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The function then determines the outcome of the game for each scenario and prints either 'Draw' or the name of the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the positions of the chips. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all scenarios, the function concludes, and the input variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are no longer relevant. **
