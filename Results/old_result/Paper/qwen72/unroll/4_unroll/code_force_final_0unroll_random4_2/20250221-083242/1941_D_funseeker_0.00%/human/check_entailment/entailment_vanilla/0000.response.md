### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` which is efficient for large inputs.
   - It uses helper functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to parse the input. These functions are correctly implemented to handle different types of input lines.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_4` initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over each throw and updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw.
   - For each throw, it checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic is correct because it accounts for both possible directions when `c` is '?'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is necessary because player `n` is represented as `0` in the modulo operation, and the output should be in the range `[1, n]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the players' numbers in increasing order. This is done using `print(len(ans))` and `print(*ans)`, which is correct.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases. It efficiently processes the throws and updates the possible positions of the ball. The final output is in the correct format and includes all possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

**Correctness: **True****
