The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. The other conditions regarding the parameters `a` and `n` are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted in the loop head context.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` must be greater than 0**
