The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers with the constraint that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000. `a` and `b` are lists of integers, each of length `n`, and each element in `a` and `b` satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n` and `k` are integers where 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, and `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n` with each element between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.**
