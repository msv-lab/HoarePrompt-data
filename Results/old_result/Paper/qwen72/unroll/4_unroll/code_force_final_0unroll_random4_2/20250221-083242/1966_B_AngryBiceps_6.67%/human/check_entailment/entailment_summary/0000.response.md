Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all squares in an n x m grid the same color after performing a series of operations. Each operation involves selecting two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares in the subrectangle defined by these two squares to the selected color.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking the following conditions:
1. If the first row is uniform in color (i.e., all characters in the first row are the same) and different from the last row, it prints 'NO'.
2. If the first column is uniform in color (i.e., all characters in the first column are the same) and different from the last column, it prints 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. The conditions checked by the program are not comprehensive enough to cover all possible scenarios where it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
WBB
BWB
BBW
```
- The first row is not uniform.
- The first column is not uniform.
- The last row is not uniform.
- The last column is not uniform.

According to the program, it would print 'YES' for this grid. However, it is impossible to make all squares the same color in this grid because there is no way to select two squares of the same color such that the subrectangle between them covers all the squares.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If the grid contains both 'W' and 'B', it is impossible to make all squares the same color because there will always be at least one square that cannot be changed to match the others. If the grid contains only one color, then it is already uniform, and the answer is 'YES'.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Flatten the grid to a single string
        flat_grid = ''.join(grid)
        
        # Check if the grid contains both 'W' and 'B'
        if 'W' in flat_grid and 'B' in flat_grid:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible scenarios where it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

Correctness: **False**
