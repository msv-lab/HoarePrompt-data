Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `input` is now a function that reads a line from standard input.**

The initial state variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The `input` variable is now a function that reads a line from standard input.
