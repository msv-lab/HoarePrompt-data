Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), and `elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(`elements`) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `elements`[i] <= 1000. Additionally, either `removals` is not equal to 6 or `negatives` is not equal to 3. `pos` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `pos`, and the other variables (`removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`, along with the new state of `pos`.
