#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains two binary strings `a` and `b`, and the lengths of `a` and `b` are within the specified ranges. Each binary string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all `a` and `b` strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: The value of `k` will be the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, and `j` will be the index in `b` where the loop stopped looking for matches (either because it reached the end of `b` or because it found all matches). The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.
