Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a list of tuples `test_cases` where each tuple contains two binary strings `a` and `b`, and the lengths of `a` and `b` are within the specified ranges. Each binary string consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. The number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of all `a` and `b` strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
```

This function will process each test case from the list `test_cases` and return the results for each test case. Each test case in `test_cases` is a tuple containing the binary strings `a` and `b`.
