The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for all elements a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
