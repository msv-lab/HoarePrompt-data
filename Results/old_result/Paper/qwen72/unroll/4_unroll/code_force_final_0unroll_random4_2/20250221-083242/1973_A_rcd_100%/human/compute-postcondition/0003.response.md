The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely operates with some internal or external input mechanism (like user input, predefined constants, or another function) to handle multiple test cases. Each test case involves three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 500. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but it is expected to return or print some result based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function handles multiple test cases, each with three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30). It processes these values for each of the `t` test cases (where 1 <= `t` <= 500) and returns or prints a result based on the values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`.**
