Output State: **The program returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.** 

This means that the program calculates the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` within the substring of `b` starting from index `j`, and then adds `j` to this position to get the final result. Since `index` is not -1, the program will always return a valid position within the original string `b`.
