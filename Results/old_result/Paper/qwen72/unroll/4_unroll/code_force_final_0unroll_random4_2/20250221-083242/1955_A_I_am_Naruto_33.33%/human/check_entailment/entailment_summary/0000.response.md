Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts, given the regular price `a` for one yogurt and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1`: The cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
     - `ans2`: The cost if as many pairs of yogurts as possible are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`).
   - It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints the regular price `a` since there is no promotional price to consider.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n == 1` by directly printing the regular price `a`.
   - For `n > 1`, it correctly computes the cost using both the regular and promotional prices and prints the minimum.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the program calculates `ans1 = 10` and `ans2 = 9`, and prints `9`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`, the program calculates `ans1 = 15` and `ans2 = 14`, and prints `14`.
   - For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the program calculates `ans1 = 15` and `ans2 = 16`, and prints `15`.
   - For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`, the program calculates `ans1 = 20` and `ans2 = 22`, and prints `20`.

The program's logic and output match the problem description and the provided example. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
