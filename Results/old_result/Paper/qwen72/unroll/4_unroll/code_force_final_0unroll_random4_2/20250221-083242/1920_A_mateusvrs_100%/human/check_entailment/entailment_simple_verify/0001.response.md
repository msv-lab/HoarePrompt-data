### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Constraints Processing:**
   - The program initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000007`) and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`). These initializations are appropriate for tracking the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, respectively.
   - The set `cx` is used to store the values that `k` must not be equal to, which is correct for handling type 3 constraints.

3. **Constraint Types:**
   - For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to x), the program updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `k` is at least as large as the largest lower bound.
   - For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to x), the program updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `k` is at most as large as the smallest upper bound.
   - For type 3 constraints (k must not be equal to x), the program adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that `k` cannot be any of these values.

4. **Validation of Bounds:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints. This is correct.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of integers in `cx` that fall within this range. This is also correct.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the problem description.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - `ax` is initialized to `1000000007`, which is a large number to ensure that any valid upper bound will be smaller.
  - `bx` is initialized to `-1`, which is a small number to ensure that any valid lower bound will be larger.
  - `cx` is a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to, ensuring no duplicates.

- **Processing Constraints:**
  - The logic for updating `bx` and `ax` based on type 1 and type 2 constraints is correct.
  - Adding values to `cx` for type 3 constraints is also correct.

- **Range Calculation:**
  - The check `if bx > ax` correctly identifies cases where no valid `k` exists.
  - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values in `cx` from the total range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
