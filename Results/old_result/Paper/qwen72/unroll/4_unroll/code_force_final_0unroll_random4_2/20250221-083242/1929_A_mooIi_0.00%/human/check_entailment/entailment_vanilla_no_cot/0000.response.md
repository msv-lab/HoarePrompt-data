Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The task is to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The program, however, sorts the array and then prints the sorted array, which does not compute the maximum beauty as required.

To solve the problem correctly, the array should be sorted in descending order, and then the beauty can be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort(reverse=True)
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1))
        print(beauty)
```

This program sorts the array in descending order to maximize the differences between consecutive elements and then calculates the beauty as the sum of these differences.
