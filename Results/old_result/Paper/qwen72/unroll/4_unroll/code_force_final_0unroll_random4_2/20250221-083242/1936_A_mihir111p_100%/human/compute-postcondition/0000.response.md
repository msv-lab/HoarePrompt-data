The print statement will output a string that includes the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified in the initial state, we can only describe them in terms of the given constraints.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is the length of the permutation p)**
