### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix with the largest possible values.
   - The largest possible value for any element in the matrix is \( n \), and we can achieve this by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The correct maximum sum of the matrix can be calculated as follows:
     - Each row will be filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), and there are \( n \) rows.
     - Each column will also be filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), and there are \( n \) columns.
     - Therefore, each element in the matrix will be \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) exactly once, and the sum of each row or column is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
     - The total sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row.
   - It calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \), which is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - It prints the maximum sum and the total number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Verification Using Annotations:**
   - **Initialization of the Matrix:**
     - `mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]` initializes the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row.
   - **Calculation of the Maximum Sum:**
     - `res = 0`
     - `for i in range(n): res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` calculates the sum using the incorrect formula.
   - **Output of the Maximum Sum and Number of Operations:**
     - `print(res, n << 1)` prints the incorrect maximum sum and the correct number of operations \( 2n \).
   - **Performing the Operations:**
     - `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`
       - `print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))` performs \( n \) Type 1 operations.
       - `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))` performs \( n \) Type 2 operations.
     - These operations correctly fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column.

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly performs the operations to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column.
   - However, the calculation of the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

Final: **False**
