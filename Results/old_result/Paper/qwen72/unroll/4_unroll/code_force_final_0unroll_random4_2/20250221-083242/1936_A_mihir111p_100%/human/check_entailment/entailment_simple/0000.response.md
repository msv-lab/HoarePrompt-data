### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Loop:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it initializes `ans1` to 0. This variable will eventually hold one of the indices that maximizes the XOR value.
   - The first loop iterates over all indices from 1 to `n-1` and compares `p[ans1] | p[ans1]` with `p[i] | p[i]` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `p[ans1] | p[ans1] < p[i] | p[i]`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This ensures that `ans1` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

2. **Second Loop:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0. `mx` will eventually hold the index of the element that, when XORed with `ans1`, gives the maximum value.
   - The second loop iterates over all indices from 1 to `n-1` and compares `p[mx] | p[ans1]` with `p[i] | p[ans1]` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `p[mx] | p[ans1] < p[i] | p[ans1]`, it updates `mx` to `i` and resets `v` to contain only `i`.
   - If `p[mx] | p[ans1] == p[i] | p[ans1]`, it appends `i` to `v`. This ensures that `v` contains all indices that, when ORed with `ans1`, give the same value as `mx`.

3. **Final Loop:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to the first element in `v` (which is `mx`).
   - The final loop iterates over the remaining elements in `v` and compares `p[ans] | p[ans]` with `p[v[i]] | p[v[i]]` using the `func_1` function.
   - If `p[ans] | p[ans] > p[v[i]] | p[v[i]]`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`. This ensures that `ans` is the index of the element that, when XORed with `ans1`, gives the maximum value.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the final answer.

### Analysis:
- The program uses the bitwise OR operation to find the maximum value in the permutation and then uses the same operation to find the pair of indices that maximize the XOR value.
- The logic of comparing `p[ans1] | p[ans1]` with `p[i] | p[i]` in the first loop is correct because it ensures that `ans1` is the index of the element with the highest value.
- The second loop correctly identifies all indices that, when ORed with `ans1`, give the same value as `mx`.
- The final loop ensures that `ans` is the index of the element that, when XORed with `ans1`, gives the maximum value.

### Query Count:
- The program makes at most `n-1` queries in the first loop, `n-1` queries in the second loop, and `len(v)-1` queries in the final loop.
- The total number of queries is at most `2n-2 + (n-1) = 3n-3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n` queries.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem constraints and logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value. The number of queries is also within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
