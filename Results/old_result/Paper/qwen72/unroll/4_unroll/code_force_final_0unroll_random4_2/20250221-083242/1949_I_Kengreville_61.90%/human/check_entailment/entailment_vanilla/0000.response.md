### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of disks `n` and initializes arrays `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` to store the coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficients for each disk.
   - It then reads the coordinates and radii for each disk and stores them in the respective arrays.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The problem can be thought of as a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and determine the coefficients for each disk.

3. **DFS and Coefficients:**
   - The `dfs` function is called for each unvisited disk. It marks the disk as visited and appends it to the `nodes` list.
   - For each disk, it checks all other disks to see if they are tangent. If they are, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for the tangent disk and recursively calls `dfs` on it.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to represent the linear relationship between the radii of the disks in a connected component. Specifically, `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` represent the equation `r[j] = coef0[j] + coef1[j] * r[i]` where `r[i]` is the radius of the starting disk in the DFS.

4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - After performing the DFS for each connected component, the function calculates the sum of the coefficients `c0` and `c1` for the disks in that component.
   - If `c1` is non-zero for any component, it means that the radii can be adjusted in such a way that the sum of the radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. This is because a non-zero `c1` indicates that the radii are not all the same, and thus there is room to adjust them.

5. **Output:**
   - If any connected component has a non-zero `c1`, the function prints `YES`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of DFS:**
  - The DFS correctly identifies all disks that are part of the same connected component (i.e., disks that are tangent to each other directly or indirectly).
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are correctly updated to maintain the tangency relationship.

- **Sum of Radii Adjustment:**
  - The key insight is that if `c1` is non-zero for any connected component, it is possible to adjust the radii such that the sum of the radii strictly decreases.
  - This is because a non-zero `c1` implies that the radii of the disks in the component are not all the same, and thus there is a way to decrease the sum by adjusting the radii.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no tangent disks by correctly setting `c1` to zero and printing `NO`.
  - It also handles the case where all disks are tangent to each other in a way that allows for a decrease in the sum of radii.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. The use of DFS to identify connected components and the calculation of coefficients to check for the possibility of decreasing the sum of radii are both sound.

Correctness: **True**
