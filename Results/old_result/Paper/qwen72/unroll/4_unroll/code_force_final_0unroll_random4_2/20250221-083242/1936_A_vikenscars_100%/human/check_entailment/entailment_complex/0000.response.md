Reasoning:

The given problem requires finding two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in a secret permutation \( p \) is maximized. The solution is to use a series of queries to determine the indices.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and receives a response indicating the relationship between \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) and \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).
- The function correctly prints the query in the required format and flushes the output.
- It then reads the response from the interactor and returns it as a string.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The first loop iterates over the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \) to find the index of the largest element in the permutation \( p \).
   - For each \( i \), it compares \( (p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \( i \). This ensures that `max_item_idx` points to the index of the largest element in the permutation.

2. **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR**:
   - The second loop iterates over the range \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) to find the index of the element that, when XORed with the element at `max_item_idx`, gives the maximum result.
   - For each \( i \), it compares \( (p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}) \) with \( (p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i) \).
   - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \( i \).
   - If the response is `=`, it further compares \( (p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \) to ensure `pair_idx` is updated correctly.

3. **Output the Result**:
   - After the loops, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect XOR Maximization**:
  - The function `func_2` is not correctly finding the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR. It is only finding the index of the largest element and then trying to find the largest element again, which does not necessarily maximize the XOR.
  - The XOR operation is not directly related to the OR operation, and the current approach does not consider the properties of XOR to find the maximum value.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the maximum XOR, a more effective approach would be to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or a binary search on the bits of the elements.
- The current approach is flawed because it does not consider the XOR properties and relies on OR operations, which do not help in maximizing XOR.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value.

Correctness: **False**
