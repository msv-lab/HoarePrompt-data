The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer `a_i` is within the range 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`.

- Case_1: If the function determines that it is not possible to partition the list `a` into two non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements in each subset is equal, it returns 'No'.
- Case_2: If the function determines that it is possible to partition the list `a` into two non-empty subsets such that the sum of elements in each subset is equal, it returns 'Yes'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, where the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`. It returns 'No' if it is not possible to partition `a` into two non-empty subsets with equal sums, and 'Yes' if it is possible.**
