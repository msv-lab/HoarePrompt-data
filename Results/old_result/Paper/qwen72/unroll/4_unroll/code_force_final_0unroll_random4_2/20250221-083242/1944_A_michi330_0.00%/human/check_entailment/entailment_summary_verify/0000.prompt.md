You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it prints `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, otherwise it prints `n - 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program is that `t` results have been printed, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \) but still significant enough to isolate some islands. Specifically, the program always prints \( n - 1 \) when \( k < n - 1 \), which is incorrect.

For example, consider the test case \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 3 \). According to the problem description, Dominater can destroy up to 3 bridges to minimize the number of islands that Everule can visit. If Dominater destroys the bridges between:

- Island 1 and Island 2
- Island 1 and Island 3
- Island 1 and Island 4

Everule will only be able to visit Island 1 and Island 5, resulting in a total of 2 islands. However, the program will output 4, which is incorrect.

The correct logic should consider the number of bridges that can be destroyed to isolate Everule from as many islands as possible. The minimum number of islands Everule can visit is determined by the number of bridges that can be destroyed to isolate Everule from the other islands. If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Everule can be isolated to only one island. Otherwise, the number of islands Everule can visit is \( n - k \) if \( k \) is less than \( n - 1 \).
