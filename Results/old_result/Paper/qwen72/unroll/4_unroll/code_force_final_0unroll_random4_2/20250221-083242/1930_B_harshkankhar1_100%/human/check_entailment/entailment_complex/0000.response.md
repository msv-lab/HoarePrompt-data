Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it should read the integer `n` and generate a permutation of length `n`.

2. **Permutation Generation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to generate a permutation of length `n` such that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) exist where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

3. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The function creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). This means that the elements at these positions are placed in reverse order, while the elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) remain in their original order.

4. **Output**: The function prints the generated permutation.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The permutation generated by the function should be a valid permutation of length `n` (i.e., it should contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once).
   - The permutation should satisfy the condition that no two distinct indices `i` and `j` exist such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

6. **Analysis**:
   - The permutation generated by reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the elements at even indices are in descending order, while the elements at odd indices are in ascending order.
   - This construction helps in breaking the divisibility condition because:
     - Elements at even indices are larger and are placed in reverse order, making it less likely for them to divide elements at odd indices.
     - Elements at odd indices are smaller and are placed in ascending order, making it less likely for them to divide elements at even indices.
   - For example, for `n = 4`, the permutation generated is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. Here, the elements at even indices are `[4, 2]` (reversed from `[2, 4]`), and the elements at odd indices are `[1, 3]` (unchanged from `[1, 3]`).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly generate a permutation that meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
