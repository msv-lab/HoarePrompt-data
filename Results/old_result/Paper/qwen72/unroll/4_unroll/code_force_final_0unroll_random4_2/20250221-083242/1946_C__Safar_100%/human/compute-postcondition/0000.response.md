Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n representing the number of edges to be removed, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge between vertices a and b, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n, `g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.** 

The code initializes `g` as a list of empty lists, with the length of the list being `n + 1`. Each element in `g` is an empty list, representing an adjacency list for a graph with `n` vertices. The values of `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged.
