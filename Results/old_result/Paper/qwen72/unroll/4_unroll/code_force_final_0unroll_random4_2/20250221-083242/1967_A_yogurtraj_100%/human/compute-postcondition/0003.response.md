Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and a target integer `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` and calculates a final value based on the sorted list and the target integer `k`. The function prints this final value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is the calculated final value. The function does not modify any variables outside of its scope, and the state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` is reset for each new test case. **
