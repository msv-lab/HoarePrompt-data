You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The loop will print a series of integers based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will be modified within the loop, but their final state after the loop completes will depend on the input provided for each iteration. The specific output for each iteration will be one of the integers printed according to the conditions, and the final state of `a` will be the list after the operations described in the loop body have been applied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from a single input line, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from another input line. The function prints an integer for each test case based on a series of specific conditions. If `k` matches certain predefined values, it prints a corresponding predefined integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `a`, it prints the length of `a`. Otherwise, it performs a series of operations to decrement elements in `a` and prints the count of zeros in the modified list. The final state of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` will vary depending on the input for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a flawed approach and does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here’s a specific example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

Actual output from the program:
```
2
```

While this specific example might work, the program has several issues:

1. **Hardcoded Values**: The program contains many hardcoded conditions for specific values of `k` and `n`. This approach is not general and will fail for inputs that do not match these specific conditions. For example, if `k` is 10000000000001, the program will not handle it correctly and will not return the expected result.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Attacks**: The program attempts to simulate the attacks by iterating through the list and reducing the durability of the first and last ships. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the number of attacks is greater than the number of ships. For example, if `k` is much larger than `n`, the program should continue attacking the remaining ships until they all sink or the Kraken stops attacking, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if `n` is 1 and `k` is greater than `a[0]`, the program should return 1 (since the single ship will sink), but it does not handle this case correctly.

4. **General Simulation Logic**: The general logic for simulating the attacks is flawed. The program should keep track of the ships that are still afloat and continue attacking the first and last of these ships until the Kraken stops attacking or all ships sink. The current implementation does not do this correctly and may break or return incorrect results for various inputs.

To ensure correctness, the program should be rewritten to handle the general case of simulating the Kraken's attacks without relying on hardcoded values.
