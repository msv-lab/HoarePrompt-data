Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, processing input scenarios for Alice's and Bob's chips on a board of dimensions (r, w) with initial positions (a, b) and (c, d). For each iteration, if `a` is greater than `c`, the output is 'Draw'. Otherwise, the loop calculates the positions and determines the winner based on the conditions provided. The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are reset for each iteration, and the variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0. The initial values of `h`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` remain unchanged.**
