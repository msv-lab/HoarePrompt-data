Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then processes the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number. If the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) or if no such segment is found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of these segments. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
