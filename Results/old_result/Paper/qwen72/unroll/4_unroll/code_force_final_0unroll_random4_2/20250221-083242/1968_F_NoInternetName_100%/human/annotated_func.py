#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that can be applied to the elements of a list generated from the input().split() method, such as int or str.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element of the list generated from splitting the input string by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `cast` and returns an iterator that applies the `cast` function to each element of a list generated by splitting a user-provided input string by spaces. The final state of the program is that it has an iterator ready to be consumed, which will yield the casted values of the input elements.
