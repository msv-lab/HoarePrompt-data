The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case.**
