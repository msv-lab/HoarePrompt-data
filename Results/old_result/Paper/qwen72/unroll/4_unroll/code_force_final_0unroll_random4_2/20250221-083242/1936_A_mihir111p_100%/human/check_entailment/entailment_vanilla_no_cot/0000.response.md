Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correctly structured to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and First Query Loop**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0, which will be one of the indices that maximizes the XOR.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_0 | p_0)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`. This step helps in finding an index `ans1` such that `p_ans1` is one of the largest values in the permutation.

2. **Second Query Loop**:
   - It initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_mx | p_ans1)` with `(p_i | p_ans1)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mx` to `i` and resets `v` to contain only `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`.
   - This step helps in finding all indices `i` such that `(p_i | p_ans1)` is equal to the maximum value found in the previous step.

3. **Final Query Loop**:
   - It initializes `mx` to the first element in `v` and `ans` to the same.
   - It iterates through the elements in `v` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_ans | p_ans)` with `(p_v[i] | p_v[i])`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.
   - This step ensures that `ans` is the index that maximizes the XOR with `ans1`.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the answer.

The program adheres to the constraints and the interaction rules specified in the problem description. It uses at most 3n queries, and it correctly identifies a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value. Therefore, the program is correct.
