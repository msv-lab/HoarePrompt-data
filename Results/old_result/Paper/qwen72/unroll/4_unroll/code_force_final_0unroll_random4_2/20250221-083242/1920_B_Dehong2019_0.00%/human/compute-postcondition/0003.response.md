Output State: **The loop will print the maximum possible value of the modified sum of the list `a` for each test case, after performing the specified operations. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` will retain their values as they were at the start of each iteration, but the intermediate variables `ans1` and `ans2` will be recalculated for each test case.**
