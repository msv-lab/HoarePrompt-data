The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `q` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0**
