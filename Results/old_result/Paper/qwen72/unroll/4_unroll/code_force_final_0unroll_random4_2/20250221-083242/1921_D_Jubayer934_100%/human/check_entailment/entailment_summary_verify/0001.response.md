### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - Array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - Array `b` is sorted in descending order.
   - This sorting is intended to maximize the absolute differences between the elements of `a` and `b`.

3. **Initial Difference Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the sorted `b` array and calculates the absolute differences with the corresponding elements of `a`.
   - These differences are stored in the list `ans`.

4. **Optimization Check**:
   - The function checks if there is a point where the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (the smallest element of `b` that hasn't been used yet) is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (the largest element of `b` that hasn't been used yet).
   - If such a point is found, it breaks the loop and stores the index `temp`.

5. **Adjusting Differences**:
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means there was a point where the smaller elements of `b` can provide a larger difference.
   - The function then iterates from `temp` to `n` and appends the differences between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to `ans`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Sorting**:
  - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is a good strategy to maximize the absolute differences.
  - This is because the largest elements of `b` will be paired with the smallest elements of `a`, and vice versa, which generally maximizes the differences.

- **Initial Differences**:
  - The initial differences are calculated by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`.

- **Optimization**:
  - The function checks if there is a better way to pair elements by comparing the differences with the smallest elements of `b` that haven't been used yet.
  - However, the optimization check is not necessary because the initial pairing of the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` already maximizes the differences. The check for `b[-(n - i)]` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where `m = n` by simply using the first `n` elements of `b`.
  - It also handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same, which would result in a zero difference if all elements in `a` are the same.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` by sorting the arrays and then pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b`. The optimization check is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program. The approach is sound and should handle all valid inputs as described in the problem.
