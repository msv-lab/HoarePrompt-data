Reasoning:  
The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank. The program then uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

The program calculates the number of additional problems needed by iterating over the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') and checking:
1. If a difficulty level is missing from the problem bank, it adds `m` to the answer (since `m` problems of that difficulty are needed for each round).
2. If a difficulty level is present but has a frequency less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to the answer (since the number of additional problems needed is the difference between `m` and the current frequency).

Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each round has one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The logic and the implementation align with the problem description and the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
