### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common technique to optimize input reading in competitive programming.
   - The variable `index` is used to track the current position in the `data` list, which is updated as the program processes each part of the input.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf` where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - The prefix XOR is used to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs**:
   - A dictionary `mp` is used to map each prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this value occurs.
   - This allows for quick lookups to check if a subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using the prefix XOR array.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is `0`, the subarray is interesting because it can be split into parts with XOR `0`.
   - If the XOR is not `0`, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i < j <= r` and `pf[i] == pf[j]`. This is done using the `bisect_left` function to find the appropriate positions in the lists stored in `mp`.

5. **Output**:
   - The results for all queries are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly calculated. For each element `a[i]`, `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
  - This ensures that the XOR of any subarray `a[l:r]` can be computed as `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.

- **Mapping**:
  - The dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs. This is crucial for checking if a subarray can be split into parts with the same XOR value.
  - The initial value `mp[0].append(0)` is correctly set to handle the case where the prefix XOR is `0`.

- **Query Handling**:
  - For each query, the program correctly computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
  - If the XOR is `0`, the subarray is interesting, and the program correctly appends 'YES' to the results.
  - If the XOR is not `0`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`. This is a correct approach to check if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `l <= i < j <= r` and `pf[i] == pf[j]`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the subarray is the entire array or when the subarray has a length of 2.
  - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the indices are found efficiently and correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It correctly processes the input, calculates the necessary values, and handles the queries as required.
