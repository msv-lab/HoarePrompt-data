Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by maximizing the sum of all numbers in the n×n matrix using no more than 2n operations. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix and Sum Calculation**:
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized with permutations of integers from 1 to `n` for each row. However, this matrix is not used in the operations or output, so it can be considered as a placeholder or a debugging aid.
   - The sum `res` is calculated using the formula `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)`. This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum for an n×n matrix filled with permutations is the sum of all integers from 1 to n, repeated n times. The formula simplifies to the sum of the first `n` natural numbers multiplied by `n`, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \times n\).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations `2n` (which is `n << 1` in bitwise notation).
   - It then prints `n` operations of type 1 and `n` operations of type 2. Each operation uses the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Operations**:
   - **Type 1 Operation**: For each row `i` from `n` to 1, the program sets the row `i` to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - **Type 2 Operation**: For each column `i` from `n` to 1, the program sets the column `i` to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Correctness of the Operations**:
   - By performing `n` type 1 operations, each row is set to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - By performing `n` type 2 operations, each column is set to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Since each operation is applied to a row or column with the same permutation, the matrix will be filled with the maximum possible values, ensuring that the sum of all elements is maximized.

6. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum `res` is calculated correctly using the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \times n\), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to `n` repeated `n` times.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem. It ensures that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using no more than 2n operations.
