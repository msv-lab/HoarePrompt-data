### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The string `s` should be as short as possible, and if there are multiple such strings, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The output should be a string `s` for each test case that satisfies the condition.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - The constructed string `s` is then returned.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Subsequence Condition**: The string `s` is constructed by repeating the first `k` characters `n` times. This means that `s` will contain each of the `k` characters at least `n` times.
   - **All Possible Subsequences**: For a string of length `n` using `k` characters, there are `k^n` possible strings. The constructed string `s` will have a length of `k * n`, which is sufficient to contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters.
   - **Shortest Length**: The constructed string `s` has a length of `k * n`, which is the minimum length required to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are present. This is because each character must appear at least `n` times, and the string must be long enough to allow for all combinations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the string `s` will be `'a'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `'ab'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the string `s` will be `'aa'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the string `s` will be `'baab'`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the string `s` will be `'abcbac'`, which is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program constructs a string `s` that meets the requirements of the problem. It ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters are present, and it does so in the shortest possible length.
