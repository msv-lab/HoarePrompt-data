Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by performing a specific operation multiple times. The program's logic is based on identifying the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements in the array, which, if removed, could potentially disrupt the array's beauty.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Segments**: The program increments `i` by 1 after checking if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. This means that if `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, it skips the next element without checking it. This can lead to incorrect segment lengths being calculated.

2. **Handling Uniform Arrays**: The program correctly identifies if the array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same) and prints `-1` in such cases. However, the logic for finding the minimum segment length is flawed, which can lead to incorrect results for non-uniform arrays.

3. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**: The program calculates the minimum segment length but does not correctly handle the case where the array is not uniform but still beautiful. It should find the smallest segment that, when removed, ensures the array cannot be made uniform using the allowed operations.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as arrays with only one or two elements, which are inherently not beautiful and should always return `-1`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
