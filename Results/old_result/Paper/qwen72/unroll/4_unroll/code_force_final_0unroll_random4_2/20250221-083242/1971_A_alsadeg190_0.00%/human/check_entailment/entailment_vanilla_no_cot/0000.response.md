Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not output the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` in the correct order as specified in the problem description. The problem requires the minimum of `x` and `y` to be printed first, followed by the maximum. However, the program prints the larger number first and the smaller number second, which is the opposite of what is required.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)
```

This version correctly prints the minimum of `x` and `y` first, followed by the maximum.
