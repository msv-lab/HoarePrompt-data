Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the function implicitly works with a tree structure that has exactly two leaves, the tree is represented by a series of edges (u, v) where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the starting node for the game is an integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, and `numbers` is an empty list.**
