The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`, and `k` is a positive integer. `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function has two possible return points:

- **Case_1**: If the function returns the positive integer `n`, it indicates the number of elements in the list `nums`.
- **Case_2**: If the function returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b`, it indicates the sum of counts of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to two specific values `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. It returns the number of elements in the list `nums` if it follows Case_1. If it follows Case_2, it returns the sum of the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` and the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b`.**
