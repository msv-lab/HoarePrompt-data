The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the variable `i` is not initialized before the loop, so it starts from 1 as specified in the `range(1, n)`.

Given that `max_item_idx` is 0, but it is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, `i` is 1, `max_item_idx` is 0**
