Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here are the key points:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Constraints Handling**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number and `bx` to a very small number to handle the minimum and maximum constraints, respectively.
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` if the constraint is of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), and it updates `ax` if the constraint is of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x).
   - It adds the values of type 3 (k must not be equal to x) to a set `cx`.
3. **Validation**:
   - If `bx` (the minimum value k can be) is greater than `ax` (the maximum value k can be), it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no k can satisfy these constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers k by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range.
4. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
