The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers from the input, representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then determines and prints whether Alice or Bob wins for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the input state (the integer `t` and the list of lists) remains unchanged, but the internal variables used within the function (`n`, `arr`, `s`, and `ans`) are reset for each test case.
