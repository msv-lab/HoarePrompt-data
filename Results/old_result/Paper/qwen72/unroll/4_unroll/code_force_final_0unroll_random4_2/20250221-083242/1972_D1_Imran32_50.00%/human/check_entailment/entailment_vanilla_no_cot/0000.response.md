Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_1` is not designed to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it seems to be performing a different calculation that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` (which should be `m` according to the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It calculates the square root of `n` and iterates from 2 to the square root of `n` plus 1.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

This logic does not match the problem's requirement to count pairs \((a, b)\) where \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair, calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
4. Count and print the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. However, it may not be efficient enough for large values of \(n\) and \(m\) due to the nested loops. For better performance, you might need to optimize the solution further.
