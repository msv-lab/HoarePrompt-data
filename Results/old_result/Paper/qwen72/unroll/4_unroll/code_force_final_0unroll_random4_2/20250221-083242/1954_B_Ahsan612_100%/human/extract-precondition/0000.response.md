Precondition: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer n representing the length of the array and an array a of integers. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element a_i in the array a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
