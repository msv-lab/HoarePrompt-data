Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of a grid where the first and last rows are not uniform but can still be made uniform through the allowed operations. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the first and last rows are not uniform, and the first and last characters of the first and last rows are not the same. However, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'B') and coloring the entire grid 'B'. The program incorrectly outputs 'NO' for this case.
