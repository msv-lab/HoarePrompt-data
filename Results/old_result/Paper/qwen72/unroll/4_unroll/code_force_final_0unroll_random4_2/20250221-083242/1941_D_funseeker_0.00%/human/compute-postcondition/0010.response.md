The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `x`. `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers with the constraints 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_4` is to accept three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` within the specified ranges and return a value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `x` where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
