Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in handling the conditions for "STAIR" and "PEAK". Specifically, the program uses two separate `if` statements to check for "STAIR" and "PEAK" conditions, which can lead to incorrect outputs in certain cases. For example, if the input is `1 2 2`, the program will print "STAIR" and then "PEAK" because both conditions are true, which is incorrect according to the problem description. The correct approach would be to use `elif` to ensure that only one condition is checked after the first one is true.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```
