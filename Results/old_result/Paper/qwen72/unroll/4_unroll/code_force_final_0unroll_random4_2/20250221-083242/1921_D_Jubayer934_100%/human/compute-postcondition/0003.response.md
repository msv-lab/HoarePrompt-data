Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b` after sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. The function prints the sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
