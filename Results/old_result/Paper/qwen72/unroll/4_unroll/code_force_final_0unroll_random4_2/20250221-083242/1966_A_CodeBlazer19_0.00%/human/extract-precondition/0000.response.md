Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take three parameters: a list of integers `numbers` representing the numbers on the cards, an integer `n` representing the number of cards, and an integer `k` representing the number of cards to be exchanged in each operation. The input should be such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100, and each element in `numbers` should satisfy 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.**
