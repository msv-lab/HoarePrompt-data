The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, up to the point where the loop stops (either because `b[j]` does not match `a[i]` or because `j` reaches `m`). The function prints this count `k` and returns nothing. The function is designed to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are read from the input, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that `k` is printed, and `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
