### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximizing the Sum:**
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix with the largest possible values.
   - The largest possible value for any element in the matrix is \( n \), and we can achieve this by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Calculating the Maximum Sum:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be calculated as follows:
     - Each row will be filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), and there are \( n \) rows.
     - Each column will also be filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), and there are \( n \) columns.
     - Therefore, each element in the matrix will be \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \) exactly once, and the sum of each row or column is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
     - The total sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Number of Operations:**
   - The program performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which totals to \( 2n \) operations.
   - This is within the allowed limit of \( 2n \) operations.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row.
   - It calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \), which is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - It prints the maximum sum and the total number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly performs the operations to fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column.
   - However, the calculation of the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

Correctness: **False**
