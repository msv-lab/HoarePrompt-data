Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`. The string `s1` consists only of characters '<' and '>', and `n` is the length of `s1`, with the constraint 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. After processing, the function prints a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element at index `i` represents the difference in the cumulative sum of the positions of '>' characters and the cumulative sum of the positions of '<' characters up to that index, adjusted by the total length of the string and the positions of the characters. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
