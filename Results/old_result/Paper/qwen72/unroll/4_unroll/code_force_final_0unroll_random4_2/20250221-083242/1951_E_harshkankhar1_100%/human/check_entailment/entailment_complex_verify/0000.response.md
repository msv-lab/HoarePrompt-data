### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Non-Palindromic String**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks if the string `s` is a palindrome.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, the program correctly prints "YES", "1", and the original string `s` and returns. This is correct because a non-palindromic string can always be partitioned into a single non-palindromic substring.

2. **Finding the First Different Character**:
   - The program iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This is a valid approach to identify a potential split point.
   - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), the program prints "NO" and returns. This is correct because if all characters are the same, the string is a palindrome, and any substring of it will also be a palindrome, making it impossible to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **Splitting the String**:
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, the program checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, the program prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. This is correct because `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` are both non-palindromic substrings.
   - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, the program further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
     - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the program prints "NO". This is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the string can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings even if `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, the program prints "YES", "2", and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. This is correct because `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` are both non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string is already non-palindromic.
   - The program correctly handles the case where all characters are the same (e.g., "aaa").
   - However, the program fails to handle the case where `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome but the string can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, if `s = "abba"`, the program will incorrectly print "NO" because `x` is 1, and `s[x + 1:]` is "ba", which is not a palindrome, but the program still prints "NO".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is **accurate**. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically the case where `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome but the string can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
