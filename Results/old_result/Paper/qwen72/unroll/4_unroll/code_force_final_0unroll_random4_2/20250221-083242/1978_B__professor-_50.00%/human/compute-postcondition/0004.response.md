Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`). Depending on the values of `a` and `b`, it calculates and prints a result for each test case. The function does not retain any values between test cases and does not modify any external variables. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the program state is such that all test cases have been processed and their respective results have been printed. **
