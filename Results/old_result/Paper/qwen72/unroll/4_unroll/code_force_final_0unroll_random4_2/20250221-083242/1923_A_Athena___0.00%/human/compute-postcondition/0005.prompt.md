You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined input mechanism, as it does not have any parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells on the ribbon, followed by a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for a chip). There is at least one chip in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, the list `a` will be printed after removing leading and trailing zeros, and the integer `res` will be printed, representing the number of zeros remaining in the list `a`. The variables `n` and `a` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `res` will be reset to 0 at the start of each iteration. After all iterations, the final values of `n`, `a`, and `res` will be those of the last test case, with `a` being the list after removing leading and trailing zeros, and `res` being the count of zeros in this final `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input consisting of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the state of a ribbon. It returns the minimum number of moves required to place all chips (represented by 1s) in the same cell.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
