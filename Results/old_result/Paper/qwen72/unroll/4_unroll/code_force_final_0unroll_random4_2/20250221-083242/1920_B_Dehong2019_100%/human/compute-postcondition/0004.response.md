The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it implicitly accepts the following parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` and `x` (integers such that 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n), and `a` (a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000). The function processes these parameters to determine a specific output based on the constraints and relationships provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. It processes these parameters to determine a specific output based on the constraints: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` and `x` are integers within the bounds of `n`, and `a` is a list of integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.**
