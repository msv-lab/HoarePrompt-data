The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function then prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one dimension is exactly half of the other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n` and the test case inputs `a` and `b` are not retained after the function concludes.
