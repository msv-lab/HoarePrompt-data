### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each of which is 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Condition Analysis:**
   - If the number of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, the XOR of the sequence will be non-zero (Alice wins).
   - If any of these counts are even, the XOR can be zero (Bob wins).

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - Removing pairs of numbers (since \( x \oplus x = 0 \)) will help in making the XOR zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero (Bob wins).

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt` for each test case.

6. **Verification:**
   - The condition `if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1` checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If true, Bob wins once by removing one of these numbers.
   - The loop `for x in a` adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`. This accounts for the pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.

### Correctness:
The program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
