Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), representing the size of an n×n matrix. The function calculates and prints the sum of the series \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \) followed by the value `2n`. Additionally, for each test case, it prints two lines for each row of the n×n matrix: the first line starts with 1 and the second line starts with 2, both followed by the row number and a sequence of integers from 1 to n. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` holds the value of the last test case processed. **
