### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in a way that maximizes the number of times the total XOR becomes zero.
   - Removing a number that is part of a pair (i.e., an even count of a number) will not change the XOR if the count of that number is even.
   - Removing a number that is part of an odd count can change the XOR to zero if the remaining counts of other numbers are such that their XOR is zero.

5. **Expression Analysis:**
   - `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2`: This part of the expression calculates the number of pairs of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) that can be removed without changing the XOR.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`: This part checks if exactly three of the first three numbers (1, 2, 3) are odd. If so, it adds 1 to the result. This is because if exactly three of the numbers are odd, removing one of them will make the XOR zero.

6. **Correctness of the Expression:**
   - The expression `a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2` correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed without affecting the XOR.
   - The expression `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` correctly identifies the scenario where removing one odd number will make the XOR zero.

7. **Test Cases:**
   - For the given test cases, the expression correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win:
     - **Test Case 1:** `1 1 1 0` -> Bob wins once (when Eve removes one of the odd numbers).
     - **Test Case 2:** `1 0 1 2` -> Bob wins once (when Eve removes one of the odd numbers).
     - **Test Case 3:** `2 2 2 0` -> Bob wins three times (since all counts are even, removing pairs will not affect the XOR).
     - **Test Case 4:** `3 3 2 0` -> Bob wins three times (since two counts are odd, removing one of them will make the XOR zero).
     - **Test Case 5:** `0 9 9 9` -> Bob wins twelve times (since all counts are odd, removing one of them will make the XOR zero).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and the properties of bitwise XOR. The expression used in the program is accurate and handles all the given test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
