### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` from the input and stores them in the list `v`.

2. **Check for Validity of Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the scores are invalid because the total points must be even (since each game results in either 2 points being distributed in a win/loss or 2 points being distributed in a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the sum of points must be even for the scores to be valid.

3. **Calculate Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is:
     \[
     \text{result} = \left( \text{v[0]} + \text{v[1]} + \text{v[2]} - \max(0, \text{v[2]} - \text{v[0]} - \text{v[1]}) \right) // 2
     \]
   - Let's break down the formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have earned without any draws. This is because if `v[2]` is more than the sum of `v[0]` and `v[1]`, it means `v[2]` must have won all the games, and any additional points would have to come from draws.
     - Subtracting this value from the total points gives the number of points that must have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 (since each draw results in 2 points) gives the maximum number of draws.
   - This formula is mathematically sound and correctly calculates the maximum number of draws.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), which results in `0` draws.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`), which results in `-1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the total points are 0, and there are no draws, so the output is `0`.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the total points are 2, and the maximum number of draws is 1 (one game ended in a draw), so the output is `1`.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the total points are 3, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the total points are 4, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (two games ended in draws), so the output is `2`.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the total points are 9, which is odd, so the output is `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the total points are 12, and the maximum number of draws is 6 (six games ended in draws), so the output is `6`.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the total points are 12, and the maximum number of draws is 2 (two games ended in draws), so the output is `2`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
