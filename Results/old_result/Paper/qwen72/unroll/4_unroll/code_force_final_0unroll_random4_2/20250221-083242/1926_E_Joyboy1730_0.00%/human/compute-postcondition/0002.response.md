Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `k` from the input, processes them, and prints a value if the condition is met. After all iterations, `t` remains unchanged, and `n` and `k` are not defined (as they are re-assigned in each iteration). The list `L` is empty at the end of each iteration. The variables `tot` and `pow` are reset to 0 and 1, respectively, at the start of each iteration.**
