### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.

2. **Subsequence Check Logic:**
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the string `s` using bitwise operations.
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count how many times a complete set of the first `k` alphabets is found as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - `cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')` converts the character `ss` to its corresponding index (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - `if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:` checks if the character `ss` has not been seen yet in the current subsequence.
   - `cur += 1 << cur_ss` updates `cur` to include the character `ss`.
   - `if cur == (1 << k) - 1:` checks if all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence. If so, it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - If `cnt >= n`, it prints 'YES' because it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - If `cnt < n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` that is missing from `s`:
     - `tmp` is set to the first character that is not present in the current subsequence.
     - `ans` is constructed by repeating the last character `k-1` times, adding `tmp`, and then padding with 'a' to reach the length `n`.

5. **Issues:**
   - The logic for constructing the missing string `ans` is incorrect. The function should generate a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`, but the current logic does not ensure this.
   - The variable `cnt` is being used to count the number of times a complete set of `k` characters is found, but the problem requires checking all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` characters.
   - The function does not generate all possible strings of length `n` and check if they are subsequences of `s`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to generate and check all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. Instead, it only counts the number of times a complete set of `k` characters is found, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. Additionally, the construction of the missing string `ans` is flawed and does not guarantee that the generated string is not a subsequence of `s`.
