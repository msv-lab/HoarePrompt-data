### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - The program initializes `cx` as a set to store the values that `k` must not be equal to (type 3 constraints).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000.0 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - It initializes `bx` to `-1` to represent the lower bound of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Constraint Updates**:
   - For each constraint, the program updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and the value `x` if the constraint is of type 1.
   - For each constraint, the program updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and the value `x` if the constraint is of type 2.
   - For each constraint, the program adds the value `x` to the set `cx` if the constraint is of type 3.

4. **Validation**:
   - The program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the program calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of values in `cx` that fall within this range.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initialization**:
  - `ax` is initialized to a very large number to ensure that any type 2 constraint will update it to a smaller value.
  - `bx` is initialized to `-1` to ensure that any type 1 constraint will update it to a larger value.

- **Constraint Handling**:
  - The program correctly updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraints.
  - The set `cx` is used to store the values that `k` must not be equal to, which is appropriate for ensuring no duplicates.

- **Range Calculation**:
  - The program correctly calculates the range of valid `k` values as `ax - bx + 1`.
  - It then subtracts the number of invalid values (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `bx` is greater than `ax` by appending `0` to the result list, which is correct.
  - The program also handles the case where there are no invalid values in the range by correctly calculating the number of valid `k` values.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. The input and output handling is correct, and the constraints are processed and validated appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
