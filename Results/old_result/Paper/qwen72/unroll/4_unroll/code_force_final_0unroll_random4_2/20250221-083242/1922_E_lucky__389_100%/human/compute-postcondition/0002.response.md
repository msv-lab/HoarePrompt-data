Output State: **`x` is an integer input by the user, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, and the function should still accept an integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and return a list of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the returned list should be within the range [-10^9; 10^9].**

The variable `mx` is initialized to 0, while the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
