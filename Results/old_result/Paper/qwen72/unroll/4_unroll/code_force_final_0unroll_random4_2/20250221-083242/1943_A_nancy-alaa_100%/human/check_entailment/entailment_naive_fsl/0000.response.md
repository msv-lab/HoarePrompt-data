Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the game's optimal strategy. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both Alice and Bob. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Test Case:**
```
1
5
0 1 2 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice and Bob are playing optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.
- The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that the MEX is as high as possible, while Bob tries to minimize it.
- In this test case, the optimal moves would be:
  1. Alice picks 2. `a = [0, 1, 2, 3]`, `c = [2]`.
  2. Bob picks 0. `a = [1, 2, 3]`, `c = [2]`.
  3. Alice picks 1. `a = [2, 3]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
  4. Bob picks 2. `a = [3]`, `c = [2, 1]`.
  5. Alice picks 3. `a = []`, `c = [2, 1, 3]`.

At the end, `c = [2, 1, 3]`, and the MEX of `c` is 4. However, the program incorrectly outputs 2.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not simulate the optimal moves of both players correctly. It only checks for the presence of elements and does not consider the strategic removal of elements by Bob to minimize the MEX. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
