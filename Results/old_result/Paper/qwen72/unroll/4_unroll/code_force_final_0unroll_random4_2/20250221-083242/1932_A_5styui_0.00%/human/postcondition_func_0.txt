The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the user, then for each of the `a` iterations, it reads another integer `d` and a string `b` from the user. It counts the number of '@' characters in `b` and prints this count. If a '*' character is encountered in `b`, the counting process stops immediately. After processing each iteration, the count is reset to 0. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` and `n` remain unchanged, `path` is unchanged, and `a` is the last input integer read by the function.
