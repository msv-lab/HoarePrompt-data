### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Position Adjustment:**
   - The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Score Initialization:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are set to `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correct as the score increases by the value at the starting position.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha by moving to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-based, and subtracting 1 is already done in the initial position adjustment. Therefore, the correct update should be `b = p[b] - 1` and `s = p[s] - 1` without the additional `- 1`.

5. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly updates the scores `bm` and `sm` using a complex formula that involves `max` and `k`. This is not necessary and does not follow the rules of the game.
   - The correct way to update the scores is to simply add the value at the current position to the score for each turn.

6. **Final Comparison:**
   - After simulating the game for `k` turns, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Correctness:
The program has several issues in the game simulation and score calculation logic. Specifically:
- The position update should not subtract 1 again.
- The score update should be a simple addition of the value at the current position.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
