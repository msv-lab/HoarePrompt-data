### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input using `sys.stdin.readline().strip()`, which is efficient for large inputs.
   - The helper functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are correctly implemented to parse the input. `func_1` reads a line of input and strips whitespace, `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer, and `func_3` splits the result of `func_1` into a list of integers. These functions are used appropriately to handle the input format.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function `func_4` initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - The program iterates over each throw and updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after each throw.
   - For each throw, it checks the direction `c`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This logic is correct because it accounts for both possible directions when `c` is '?'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and replaces it with `n` if it is. This is necessary because player `n` is represented as `0` in the modulo operation, and the output should be in the range `[1, n]`.
   - The check and replacement are correctly implemented using `if 0 in ans: ans.discard(0); ans.add(n)`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the players' numbers in increasing order. This is done using `print(len(ans))` and `print(*ans)`, which is correct.
   - The use of `*ans` in the print statement ensures that the elements of the set are printed in the correct format.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **Function 1:**
  - The function correctly reads a line of input and strips leading and trailing whitespace.
  - **State:** None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.

- **Function 2:**
  - The function correctly converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
  - **State:** The function does not directly manipulate any input parameters and returns an integer.

- **Function 3:**
  - The function correctly splits the result of `func_1` into a list of integers.
  - **State:** The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers.

- **Function 4:**
  - The function correctly initializes `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`.
  - The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
  - The loop iterates `m` times, processing each throw.
  - For each throw, the program correctly updates the set `temp` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
  - After processing all throws, the program correctly handles the edge case where `0` is in the set `ans` by replacing it with `n`.
  - The program correctly prints the number of players who could have the ball and the players' numbers in increasing order.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the problem requirements, including the edge cases and the format of the output. The logic for processing the throws and updating the possible positions of the ball is sound and efficient.

Final: **True**
