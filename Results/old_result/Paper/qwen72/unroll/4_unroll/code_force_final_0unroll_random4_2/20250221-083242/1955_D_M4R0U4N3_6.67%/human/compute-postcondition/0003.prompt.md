You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept three parameters: n, m, and k (1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and two lists of integers: a (length n, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) and b (length m, 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is given (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        todo = set(map(int, input().split()))
        
        done = set()
        
        extra = set()
        
        for j in range(m):
            if a[j] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[j])
                done.add(a[j])
            else:
                extra.add(a[j])
        
        ans = 1 if len(done) >= k else 0
        
        for r in range(m, n):
            old = a[r - m]
            if old in extra:
                extra.remove(old)
            elif old in done:
                done.remove(old)
                todo.add(old)
            if a[r] in todo:
                todo.remove(a[r])
                done.add(a[r])
            else:
                extra.add(a[r])
            if len(done) >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, it has printed the number of valid segments of length `m` in the list `a` where at least `k` elements from the list `b` are present. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset and reinitialized for each test case, so they do not retain their values between test cases. After the loop, the program has finished executing and there are no more test cases to process.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result is based on the given parameters and lists for that test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
