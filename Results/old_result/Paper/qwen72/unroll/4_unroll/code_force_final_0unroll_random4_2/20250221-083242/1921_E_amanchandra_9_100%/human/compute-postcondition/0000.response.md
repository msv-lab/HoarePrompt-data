Output State: **The function `func` is intended to process game scenarios with parameters for the board dimensions (h, w) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). Each of these parameters should be integers, with h and w representing the height and width of the board, respectively, and (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, respectively. The conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9 must be satisfied, and it is guaranteed that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The variable `t` is assigned the value of an integer input.**
