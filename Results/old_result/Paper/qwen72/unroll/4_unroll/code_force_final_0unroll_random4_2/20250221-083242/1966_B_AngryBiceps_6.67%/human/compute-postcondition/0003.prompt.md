You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop reads the input for each test case, processes the grid, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` will have their final values corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` will be unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` reads input from stdin, where the input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes each test case and outputs the results to stdout.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
