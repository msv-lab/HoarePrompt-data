The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
