### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Sum Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - This is correct because the total number of points in all games must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Score Comparison**:
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is at least the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it means that `p3` could have won all the games or there could have been a large number of draws.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - The loop initializes `x` and `y` to 0 and `p3` respectively.
   - It then iterates, decrementing `y` and incrementing `x` until `y` is less than `x`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the sum of scores is odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.
   - The loop logic for finding the maximum number of draws is complex, but it seems to be attempting to balance the scores by reducing `p1` and `p2` while increasing the number of draws.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and since `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the loop is not entered, and `p3` (0) is printed.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. The loop finds `x = 0` and `y = 1`, and since `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` (1).
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so `-1` is printed.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. The loop finds `x = 1` and `y = 1`, and since `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` (2).
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so `-1` is printed.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and `p3` is not greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. The loop finds `x = 1` and `y = 4`, and since `p1 - x <= p2 - y` is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` (6).
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, so `p1 + p2` (2) is printed.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the edge cases and examples correctly. The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is sound, and the conditions for invalid scores are correctly checked.

Correctness: **True**
