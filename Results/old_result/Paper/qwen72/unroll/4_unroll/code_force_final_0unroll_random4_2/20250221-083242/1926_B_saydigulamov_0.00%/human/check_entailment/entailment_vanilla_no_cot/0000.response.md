Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Output Mismatch**: The program prints the list `k` instead of the required output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".
2. **Shape Detection Logic**: The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle. A square will have all rows with the same number of '1's, while a triangle will have a specific pattern of increasing or decreasing '1's.
3. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the grid for each test case and then determine the shape.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_triangle(k):
    n = len(k)
    # Check for a normal triangle
    for i in range(n):
        if k[i] != 2 * (i + 1) - 1:
            return False
    # Check for an upside-down triangle
    for i in range(n):
        if k[i] != 2 * (n - i) - 1:
            return False
    return True

def is_square(k):
    return all(k[i] == k[0] for i in range(len(k)))

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        k = []
        for _ in range(n):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if is_square(k):
            print("SQUARE")
        elif is_triangle(k):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("TRIANGLE")  # If it's not a square, it must be a triangle

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_triangle Function**: This function checks if the list `k` represents a triangle by verifying if the number of '1's in each row follows the pattern of a normal triangle or an upside-down triangle.
2. **is_square Function**: This function checks if the list `k` represents a square by verifying if all rows have the same number of '1's.
3. **func Function**: This function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the correct output based on the shape detected.

This corrected version should correctly determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle for each test case.
