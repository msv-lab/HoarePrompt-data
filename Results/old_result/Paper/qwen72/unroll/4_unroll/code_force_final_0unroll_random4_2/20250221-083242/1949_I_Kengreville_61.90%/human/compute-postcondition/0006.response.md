The function `dfs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, where n is the number of disks. The function also implicitly uses the following lists: `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1`. These lists are all of length n, where `x` and `y` represent the integer coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` represents the positive integer radii of the disks, `visited` indicates whether a disk has been visited, `nodes` stores the sequence of visited disks, and `coef0` and `coef1` store coefficients related to the radii adjustments.

The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) process on the disks, updating the state of the disks and the related lists as it goes. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it modifies the `visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to reflect the progress of the DFS.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) on the disks, updating the state of the disks and related lists (`visited`, `nodes`, `coef0`, and `coef1`). The function does not return any value explicitly.**
