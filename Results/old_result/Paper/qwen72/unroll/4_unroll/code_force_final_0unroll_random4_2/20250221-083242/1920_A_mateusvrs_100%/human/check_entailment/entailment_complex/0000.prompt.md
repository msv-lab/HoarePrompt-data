Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. a denotes the type of constraint: a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

    #State: `r` is a list containing the number of valid integers `k` for each test case, where `k` satisfies all the given constraints. Each element in `r` corresponds to a test case and represents the count of integers `k` that meet the conditions: `k` is greater than or equal to the maximum of all type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of all type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints within the range. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [r[0]]  
    #[r[1]]  
    #[r[2]]  
    #...  
    #[r[n-1]] (where each [r[i]] is the count of valid integers `k` for the corresponding test case, and n is the number of test cases)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` indicates the type of constraint and `x` is the value. The function calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case that satisfy the following conditions: `k` must be greater than or equal to the maximum of all type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of all type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints within the range. The function returns a list `r` where each element corresponds to a test case and represents the count of valid integers `k`. If no valid `k` exists for a test case, the corresponding element in `r` is 0. The function then prints each element of `r` on a new line.
