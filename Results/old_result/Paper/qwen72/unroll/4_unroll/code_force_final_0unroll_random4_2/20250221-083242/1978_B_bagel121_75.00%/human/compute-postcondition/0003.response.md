The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function will process multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function is expected to handle `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function will return a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, each between 1 and 10^9, and returns a result based on these values.**
