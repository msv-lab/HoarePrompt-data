#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` where each `p_i` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all `p_i` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. However, the function definition provided does not include parameters for the input values, which are necessary to solve the problem as described.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. If for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`, `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is true, the loop prints `2` and breaks. Otherwise, after completing the inner loop, it prints `3`. The variables `x`, `l`, and `flag` are updated within the loop, but their final values are not predictable without the specific inputs. The loop does not modify `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It checks if there is any index `i` in the range `[0, x)` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop for that test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3` after completing the loop. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input `n`. The final state of the program includes `n` lines of output, each containing either `2` or `3` depending on the input for each test case.
