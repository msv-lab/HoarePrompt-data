Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case. The loop has printed 'NO' for each odd n and 'YES' followed by a pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' for each even n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 50`. If `n` is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, the function prints 'YES', followed by a string pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters of length `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'NO' for each odd `n` and 'YES' followed by the alternating pattern for each even `n`.
