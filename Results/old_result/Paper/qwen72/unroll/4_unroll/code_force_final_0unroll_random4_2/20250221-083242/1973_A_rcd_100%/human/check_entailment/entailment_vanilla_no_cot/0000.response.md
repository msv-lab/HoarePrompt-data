Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the maximum number of draws. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program correctly checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If it's not, the scores are invalid, and it prints `-1`.

2. **Case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`:**
   - The program prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws. This is correct because if `p3` is at least the sum of `p1` and `p2`, it means all games could have ended in draws, and the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`.

3. **Case where `p3 < p1 + p2`:**
   - The program attempts to find a valid distribution of draws and wins/losses. However, the logic in the `while` loop is flawed. The loop tries to find a point where `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, but this approach does not correctly account for the total number of games played and the distribution of points.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly determine the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) / 2`.
- Each game can either be a win/loss (2 points total) or a draw (2 points total).
- The maximum number of draws is the number of games where the total points can be distributed such that the scores are consistent with the given constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_draws = min(p1 + p2, total_games)
        if max_draws > p3:
            max_draws = p3
        print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Total Points and Games:**
   - Calculate the total points and check if it's even.
   - Calculate the total number of games as `total_points // 2`.

2. **Maximum Draws:**
   - The maximum number of draws is the minimum of `p1 + p2` and `total_games`, because `p1 + p2` represents the maximum possible draws if all games involving the first two players were draws.
   - If `max_draws` is greater than `p3`, it means the distribution is not possible, so we set `max_draws` to `p3`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws for each test case.
