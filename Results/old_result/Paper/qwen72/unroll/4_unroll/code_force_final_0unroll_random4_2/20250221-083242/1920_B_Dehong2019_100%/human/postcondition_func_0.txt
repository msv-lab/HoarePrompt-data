The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a modified sum of the list `a` for each test case. The modified sum is computed by initially summing all elements of `a`, then subtracting twice the value of the first `x` elements, and finally adjusting the sum by adding the value of the first `k` elements and subtracting twice the value of the elements from position `k + x` to the end of the list, if they exist. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
