You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and its length n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is a string provided by the user with a length between 1 and 1,000,000 characters)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `n` is the length of the string `s`, `x` is -1, and `s` is a string provided by the user with a length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. Additionally, `func_1(s[0:])` is true.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]`, `x` will be the index of the first occurrence of such a character. Otherwise, `x` remains -1. The value of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character, and the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: - Since `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first such character.
        #   - `s[:x + 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
        #   - `s[x + 1:]` will include all characters from the first character that is different from `s[0]` to the end of the string.
        #
        #Given the precondition, the output will be the first part of the string up to and including the first different character, followed by a space, and then the rest of the string.
        #
        #Output:
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: [s[:x + 2]] ' ' [s[x + 2:]] (where [s[:x + 2]] is the substring of s from the start up to and including the character at index x + 1, and [s[x + 2:]] is the substring of s starting from the character at index x + 2 to the end)
        #State: *`s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character, the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. If `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, then the if part is executed. Otherwise, `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, and the else part is executed.
    #State: *`s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character, and the values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, the if part is executed. Otherwise, if `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, the else part is executed, and if `x` is either 1 or `n // 2`, the if part is executed. If `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`, the else part is executed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing.

Case_2: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
