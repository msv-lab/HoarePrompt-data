### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` is indeed flawed in its logic for determining the cost of moving to the closest city. The function sets the cost to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to the absolute difference otherwise. This is incorrect because the problem states that moving to the closest city always costs 1 coin, regardless of the distance.
   - The correct approach should be to set the cost to 1 if the forward city is closer, and to 1 if the backward city is closer. If the forward city is closer, the cost should be 1, and if the backward city is closer, the cost should also be 1. If the forward and backward cities are equally close, the cost should still be 1, but this case is not possible due to the problem's constraints that the closest city is unique.

2. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the incorrect costs from `func_1`. This means that the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results when calculating the minimum number of coins for each query.
   - The prefix sums should be calculated based on the correct costs of moving to the closest city, which should always be 1.

3. **Handling of Backward Cities**:
   - The program reverses the list of cities to calculate the backward costs, but the logic within `func_1` is not symmetric. This means that the backward costs are not calculated correctly, leading to incorrect results for queries where the starting city is greater than the ending city.
   - The function `func_1` should be symmetric in its logic to handle both forward and backward directions correctly. However, the current implementation is not symmetric, and it does not correctly handle the backward direction.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because of the issues mentioned above. For example:
- The cost to travel from city 1 to city 4 should be 3 coins (1 coin to city 2, 1 coin to city 3, and 1 coin to city 4), but the program will likely produce a different result due to the incorrect cost calculations.
- The cost to travel from city 3 to city 2 should be 4 coins (1 coin to city 4, 5 coins to city 5, and 8 coins to city 1, then 1 coin to city 2), but the program will likely produce a different result due to the incorrect backward cost calculations.

### Corrected Function:
A corrected version of `func_1` would be:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1
    return prog_cities
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program contains significant logical errors in the `func_1` function and the use of prefix sums, leading to incorrect results for the given problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
