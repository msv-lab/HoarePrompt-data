### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer `n` from the input.
   - It creates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`.
   - It then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`.
   - Finally, it prints the list `a` using `print(*a)`.

3. **Permutation Validity:**
   - The problem requires a permutation of length `n` such that there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - The program generates a permutation by reversing the elements at even indices. This approach ensures that the elements at even indices are in a different order than the elements at odd indices, which helps in breaking the divisibility pattern.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For `n = 4`, the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, `a` becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.
     - Check: `p_1 = 4` does not divide `p_3 = 3`, and `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = 1`.
   - For `n = 3`, the list `a` is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, `a` becomes `[3, 2, 1]`.
     - Check: `p_1 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1`, and `p_2 = 2` does not divide `p_4` (since `p_4` does not exist).

5. **General Validity:**
   - The approach of reversing the elements at even indices ensures that the permutation is valid for the given constraints. This is because the elements at even indices are no longer in their original order, which breaks any potential divisibility patterns that could exist in the original list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the problem's constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
