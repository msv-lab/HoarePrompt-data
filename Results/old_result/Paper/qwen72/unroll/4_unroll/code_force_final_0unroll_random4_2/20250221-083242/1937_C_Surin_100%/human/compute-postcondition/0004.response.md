The function `func` operates in an environment where there is a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, and both `i` and `j` are within the range 0 ≤ i, j < n. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in a hidden permutation p is maximized, given that 0 ≤ i, j < n and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.**
