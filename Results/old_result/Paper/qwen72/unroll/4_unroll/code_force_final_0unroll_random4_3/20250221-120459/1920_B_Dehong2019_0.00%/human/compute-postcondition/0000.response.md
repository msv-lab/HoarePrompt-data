Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. No variables are affected by the code snippet.**

The code snippet provided is a comment block and does not contain any executable Python code. Therefore, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The initial state remains valid as no changes have been made to the variables.
