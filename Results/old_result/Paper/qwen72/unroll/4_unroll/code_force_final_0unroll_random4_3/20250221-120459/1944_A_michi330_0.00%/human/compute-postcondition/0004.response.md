Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the number of bridges that can be destroyed. The function then prints either `1` if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, or `n - 1` otherwise. The function does not return any values. After the function concludes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last values read from the input in the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. **
