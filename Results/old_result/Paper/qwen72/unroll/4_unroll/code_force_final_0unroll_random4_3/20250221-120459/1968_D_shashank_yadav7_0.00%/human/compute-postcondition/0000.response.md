Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S` are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. `p` is a permutation of length n, where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. `a` is an array of length n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
