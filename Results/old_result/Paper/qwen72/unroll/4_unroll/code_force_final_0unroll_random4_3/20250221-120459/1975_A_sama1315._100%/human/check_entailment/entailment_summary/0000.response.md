Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: A list `a` of positive integers.
   - **Logic**: The function checks if the sorted version of `a` is a contiguous subsequence of the list `a` concatenated with itself (`a + a`). This is a valid approach because if the sorted version of `a` can be found as a contiguous subsequence in `a + a`, it means that by splitting `a` at the appropriate point and swapping the prefix and suffix, we can achieve the sorted array.
   - **Output**: Returns 'Yes' if such a subsequence is found, otherwise returns 'No'.
   - **Correctness**: The logic implemented in `func_1` is correct for the problem. If the sorted array is a contiguous subsequence of `a + a`, it means that the array can be split and swapped to achieve the sorted order.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads input from `sys.stdin`.
   - **Logic**: 
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
     - It calls `func_1` for each array `a` and collects the results.
     - Finally, it prints each result on a new line.
   - **Output**: Prints the results for each test case.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases and applies `func_1` to each array. It reads the input in the correct format and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted by the specified operation and processes multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
