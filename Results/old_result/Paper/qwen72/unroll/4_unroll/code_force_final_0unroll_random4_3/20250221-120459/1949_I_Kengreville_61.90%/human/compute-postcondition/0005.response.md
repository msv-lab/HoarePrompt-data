Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer representing the index of a disk, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of disks, `x` and `y` are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of positive integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of booleans indicating whether a disk has been visited, `nodes` is a list of integers representing the indices of the disks being processed, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of numbers representing coefficients used in the DFS algorithm. If `visited[i]` is `False`, the `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes` lists are modified as follows: For each disk `j` that has not been visited and whose center is exactly `r[i] + r[j]` units away from the center of disk `i`, `visited[j]` becomes `True`, `coef0[j]` is updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is updated to `-coef1[i]`, and `j` is appended to `nodes`. If `visited[i]` is `True`, no changes are made to any of the lists.***
