Precondition: **The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take parameters `n`, `m_1`, `m_2`, `p`, and `s` where `n` is the length of the permutation, `m_1` and `m_2` are the number of prefix and suffix maximums respectively, `p` is a list of indices of prefix maximums in increasing order, and `s` is a list of indices of suffix maximums in increasing order. Additionally, `1 <= m_1, m_2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.**

However, the function definition provided is incorrect and should be updated to match the problem description. Here is the correct function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing (n, m_1, m_2, p, s)
    # where p and s are lists of indices
    pass
```

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing five elements: n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), m_1 (1 <= m_1 <= n), m_2 (1 <= m_2 <= n), p (a list of m_1 integers in increasing order, 1 <= p_i <= n), and s (a list of m_2 integers in increasing order, 1 <= s_i <= n). The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
