Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the sum calculation and the operations applied are not consistent with the problem description.

### Issues:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The formula used in the loop:
     ```python
     sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
     does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) should be:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} = n \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     For example, for \( n = 2 \), the maximum sum should be \( 2 \times (1 + 2) = 6 \), not 7 as the program outputs.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations applied in the program are not optimal for maximizing the sum. The program assigns the same permutation to both rows and columns, which does not necessarily maximize the sum. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations:
     ```python
     print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
     will result in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     which has a sum of 6, but the program outputs 7 as the maximum sum.

### Correct Example for \( n = 2 \):
- The correct operations to maximize the sum for \( n = 2 \) could be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 1 operation on row 2: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 2 operation on column 1: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 2 operation on column 2: \( [2, 1] \)

  This results in the matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  which has a sum of 6, the maximum possible sum for \( n = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and the operations applied do not always maximize the sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
