Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and checks if the first row or the first and last columns are entirely the same character ('W' or 'B') but differ from the last row or the last column, respectively. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The variables `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.**
