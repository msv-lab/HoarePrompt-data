Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations for each of the t test cases. For each test case, the variable `res` holds the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and the value `n << 1` (which is 2 * n) is printed alongside `res`. Additionally, for each value of i from n down to 1, two lines are printed: the first line starts with '1' followed by i and the range from 1 to n, and the second line starts with '2' followed by i and the range from 1 to n. The variables `t` and `n` retain their values as they were at the start of each test case, but the loop has completed its execution for all test cases.**
