### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable since it reads input directly within the function.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Variable Naming and Assignment**:
   - Inside the loop, the function reads six integers from the input and assigns them to variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
   - These variables correspond to the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)` respectively. However, the variable names `r` and `c` are used instead of `h` and `x_b`, which might be confusing but does not affect the correctness of the logic.

3. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The function first checks if `a > c`. If Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, the game is a draw because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down.
   - This condition is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Move Calculation**:
   - If `a <= c`, the function calculates the number of moves `x` that can be made by either player to potentially meet.
   - The calculation `x = abs(a - c) // 2` is correct for determining the number of moves needed for Alice and Bob to potentially meet.

5. **Odd and Even Move Handling**:
   - If the number of moves `abs(a - c)` is odd, the function calculates the range of possible positions `l` and `r` where Alice's chip could be after `x` moves.
   - The function then checks if Alice's chip can be in the same position as Bob's chip after `x` moves. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If the number of moves `abs(a - c)` is even, the function calculates the range of possible positions `l` and `r` where Bob's chip could be after `x` moves.
   - The function then checks if Bob's chip can be in the same position as Alice's chip after `x` moves. If so, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case based on the conditions specified.
   - The use of `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` and `print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[condition])` is a concise way to print the result based on the boolean condition.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the initial conditions, calculates the possible moves, and determines the outcome based on the positions of the chips. The variable names are consistent with the problem description, and the logic for determining the winner or a draw is sound.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
