### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - It checks if there is at least one '1' in each row and appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

2. **Shape Determination**:
   - After collecting the counts of '1's in each row, the program checks if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal.
   - If they are equal, it prints the list `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required by the problem statement.
   - Instead, it prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output**:
  - The program does not correctly determine and print whether the shape is a "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".
  - It simply prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal, which is not the expected output.

- **Logic Incompleteness**:
  - The program does not handle the logic for determining if the shape is a triangle or a square.
  - It only checks if the first and second elements of `k` are equal, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. It fails to correctly identify and print the shape as "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Correctness: **False**
