Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the number of unique elements in the array `a` after removing the longest prefix or suffix of equal elements. If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it prints the number of unique elements after removing both the prefix and suffix of equal elements. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, but the loop iterates through all `t` test cases.**
