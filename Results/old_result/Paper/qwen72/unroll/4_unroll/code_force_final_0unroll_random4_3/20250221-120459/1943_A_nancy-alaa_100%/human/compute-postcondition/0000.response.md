The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the number of iterations must be at least 1. This means the input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
