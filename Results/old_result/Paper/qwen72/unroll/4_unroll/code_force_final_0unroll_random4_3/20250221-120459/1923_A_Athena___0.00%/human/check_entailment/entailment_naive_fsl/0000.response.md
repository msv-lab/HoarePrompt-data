Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips that need to be moved to form a single block. For example, consider the input:

```
1
9
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```

The expected output is 4, as you need to move each of the chips in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th positions to the left to form a single block. However, the program will output 0 because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is incorrect. The program fails to account for the need to move chips within the block to form a single contiguous block.
