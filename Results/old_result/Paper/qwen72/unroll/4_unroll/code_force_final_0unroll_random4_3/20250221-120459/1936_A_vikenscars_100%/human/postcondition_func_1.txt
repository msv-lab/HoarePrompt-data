The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 10^4. It determines two indices, `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`, based on the results of calls to `func_1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `max_item_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' during the first loop, and `pair_idx` is the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '<' or the highest value of `i` for which `func_1` returned '=' and `func_1` on the second call returned '>'. The function then prints the values of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the format: `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.
