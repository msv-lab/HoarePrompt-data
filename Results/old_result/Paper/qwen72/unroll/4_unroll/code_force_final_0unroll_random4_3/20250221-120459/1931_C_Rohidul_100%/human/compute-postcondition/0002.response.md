The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but does not explicitly list the parameters in the function signature. Based on the provided constraints, the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The function should process these inputs and return a result for each test case. However, without the explicit parameters and the specific output logic, the exact functionality cannot be fully described. Assuming the function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 <= a_i <= n). The function returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^5.**
