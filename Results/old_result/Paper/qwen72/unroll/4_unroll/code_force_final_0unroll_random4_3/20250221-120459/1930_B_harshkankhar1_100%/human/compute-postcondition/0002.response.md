To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the list `a`:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the list `a` are in reverse order.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a` Construction**:
   - The list `a` starts with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - For even indices, the elements are reversed. This means that the elements at even indices will be in descending order from the highest to the lowest.

2. **Example for Clarity**:
   - Let's take a small example with `n = 5`:
     - The original list would be: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
     - After reversing the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4), the list becomes: `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

3. **General Pattern**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will have:
     - Elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) in ascending order.
     - Elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in descending order.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
The list `a` will be printed with elements at even indices in descending order and elements at odd indices in ascending order.

Output: **[n, 2, n-1, 4, n-2, 6, ..., n%2+1, n-1, n%2] (where the elements at even indices are in descending order from n to 1, and the elements at odd indices are in ascending order from 2 to n-1)**

This output format ensures that the elements at even indices are reversed while the elements at odd indices remain in their original order.
