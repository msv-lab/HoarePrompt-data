Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `nums` remains unchanged, `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when counted from the end of the list, `s_a` is the sum of the first `ans` elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a`, and `s_b` is the sum of the last `ans` elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b`.**
