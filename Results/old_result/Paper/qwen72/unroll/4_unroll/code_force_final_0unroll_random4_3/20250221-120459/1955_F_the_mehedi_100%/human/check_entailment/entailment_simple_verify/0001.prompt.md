You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` should take four non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` as input, where each integer represents the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence, respectively, and 0 <= p1, p2, p3, p4 <= 200.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The values of p1, p2, p3, and p4 remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Initial XOR Analysis**:
   - The numbers in the sequence are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The XOR of these numbers can be analyzed:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 3 = 2 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 4 = 5 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 3 = 1 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 4 = 6 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 4 = 7 \)

4. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero.
   - Removing pairs of the same number (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), or (4, 4) will not change the XOR of the remaining sequence.
   - Removing a single number from an odd count of that number will change the XOR of the remaining sequence.

5. **Counting Pairs**:
   - For each number, the maximum number of pairs that can be removed is \( \lfloor \frac{p_i}{2} \rfloor \).
   - Removing pairs does not affect the XOR of the remaining sequence.

6. **Handling Odd Counts**:
   - If there are odd counts of numbers, removing one of them will change the XOR.
   - If all counts are odd, removing one number will make the XOR zero, and Bob wins.

7. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if all counts are odd and increments `cnt` by 1 if true.
   - It then adds the number of pairs for each count to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

8. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all counts are odd by adding 1 to `cnt`.
   - It correctly counts the number of pairs for each count using \( \lfloor \frac{p_i}{2} \rfloor \).
   - The total count `cnt` represents the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
