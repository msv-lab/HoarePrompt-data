Reasoning:  
The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve either setting all elements in a row or all elements in a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

The provided program calculates the maximum possible sum for the matrix and prints it along with the number of operations, which is \( 2n \). The sum is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \]

Let's break down the sum calculation:
- For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 = 1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 7 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 1 + (2^2 - 1^2) \cdot 2 + (3^2 - 2^2) \cdot 3 = 1 + 3 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 3 = 1 + 6 + 15 = 22 \).

This formula correctly calculates the maximum sum for the matrix, which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) multiplied by \( n \).

The program then prints \( 2n \) operations, where each operation is either a Type 1 or Type 2 operation, and the permutation used is always the sequence from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that each row and each column is filled with the permutation from 1 to \( n \), which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

The operations are:
- Type 1 operation on row \( n - j + 1 \) with permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- Type 2 operation on column \( n - j + 1 \) with permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

These operations are valid and ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.

Therefore, the program is correct in terms of both the sum calculation and the operations used to achieve the maximum sum.
