### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid, `n`, and then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid.
   - It checks if there is at least one '1' in each row and appends the count of '1's in that row to the list `k`.

2. **Shape Determination**:
   - The program attempts to determine the shape by checking if the first and second elements of the list `k` are equal.
   - However, this check is insufficient to determine whether the shape is a square or a triangle. A square has all rows with the same number of '1's, while a triangle has a specific pattern of increasing or decreasing counts of '1's.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the list `k` if the first and second elements are equal, which is not the expected output according to the problem statement.
   - The correct output should be "SQUARE" if the shape is a square and "TRIANGLE" if the shape is a triangle.

4. **Logic Incompleteness**:
   - The program lacks the necessary logic to correctly identify the shape.
   - It does not check the entire list `k` to determine if it forms a valid square or triangle pattern.
   - For a square, all elements in `k` should be equal.
   - For a triangle, the elements in `k` should form a sequence where each element is 2 more or 2 less than the previous one (for an upright or upside-down triangle, respectively).

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output**:
  - The program does not print "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" as required.
  - It prints the list `k` instead, which is not the correct format.

- **Logic Incompleteness**:
  - The program only checks the first two elements of `k`, which is not enough to determine the shape.
  - It does not handle the logic for checking the entire list `k` to determine if it forms a valid square or triangle pattern.

### Correctness:
- The program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. It fails to correctly identify and print the shape as "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Final: **False**
