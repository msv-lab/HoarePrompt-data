### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized side will always result in two rectangles with at least one odd side, and combining them will not form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The key is to check if the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times 2b\), which is different from the original if \(a/2 \neq b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles. These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times b/2\), which is different from the original if \(a \neq b/2\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because there is no way to cut a 1x1 rectangle.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting a 2x1 rectangle results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, both of which are the same as the original.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(n\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - It checks if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangle would be the same as the original.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" because a new rectangle can be formed.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the resulting rectangle is the same as the original.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" for all other cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

6. **Verification with Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the loop will execute \(n\) times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers \(a\) and \(b\) from the input.
   - The conditions checked in the program are consistent with the reasoning provided:
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints "NO".
     - If \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\), it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES".
   - The values of \(a\) and \(b\) are updated with each iteration, but the value of \(n\) remains unchanged, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided. The annotated code supports the original assessment and confirms that the program handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases correctly.

Final: **True**
