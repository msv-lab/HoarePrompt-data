You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with specific parameters for the problem, but the function definition provided does not include these parameters. For the problem described, the function should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept an integer `n` representing the number of cells, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1, where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. Additionally, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` contains at least one chip (1).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is the last non-empty list of integers after removing leading and trailing zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1. The function then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and prints the modified list. It calculates and prints the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` after the removal of leading and trailing zeros. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is the last non-empty list of integers after removing leading and trailing zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are multiple blocks of chips that need to be moved to form a single block. For example, consider the input:

```
1
9
0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
```

The expected output is 4, as you need to move each of the chips in the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th positions to the left to form a single block. However, the program will output 0 because it only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, which is incorrect. The program fails to account for the need to move chips within the block to form a single contiguous block.
