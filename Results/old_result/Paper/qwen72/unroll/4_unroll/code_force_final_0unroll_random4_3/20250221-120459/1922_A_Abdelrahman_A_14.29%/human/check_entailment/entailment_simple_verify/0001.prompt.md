You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:

                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `tests` times, and for each test case, it will read `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`, it will print 'NO' or 'YES' respectively. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final states corresponding to the last test case, and the variable `no` will be `True` if the last test case did not print 'YES', otherwise it will be `False`. The variable `tests` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of length \(n\).
- We need to determine if there exists a template \(t\) such that:
  - \(a\) and \(b\) match \(t\).
  - \(c\) does not match \(t\).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \(n\) of the strings.
   - It then reads the strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program checks if \(c\) is equal to \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) is equal to either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints "NO" and sets the flag `no` to `False`.
   - This check is correct because if \(c\) is equal to \(a\) or \(b\), it is impossible for \(c\) to not match the template while \(a\) and \(b\) do.

3. **Character Check:**
   - If \(c\) is not equal to \(a\) or \(b\), the program iterates over each character in \(c\).
   - For each character \(x\) in \(c\), it checks if \(x\) is not present in \(a\) or \(b\).
   - If such a character \(x\) is found, it prints "YES" and sets the flag `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.

4. **Final Output:**
   - If the loop completes without finding a character in \(c\) that is not in \(a\) or \(b\), the program prints "NO".

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Logic for Template Matching:**
  - The program checks if any character in \(c\) is not present in \(a\) or \(b\). This is not the correct way to determine if \(c\) does not match the template.
  - The correct approach should be to check if for each position \(i\), the character \(c_i\) can be different from the corresponding characters in \(a\) and \(b\) when the template character is uppercase, and the same when the template character is lowercase.

### Correct Approach:
- For each position \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\):
  - If \(a_i \neq b_i\), then the template can have an uppercase character at position \(i\) that is different from both \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). \(c_i\) must be different from this uppercase character.
  - If \(a_i = b_i\), then the template can have the same lowercase character at position \(i\) as \(a_i\) and \(b_i\). \(c_i\) must be different from this lowercase character.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining if \(c\) does not match the template while \(a\) and \(b\) do.
- The program incorrectly assumes that if any character in \(c\) is not present in \(a\) or \(b\), then \(c\) does not match the template. This is not the correct condition for the template matching problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly check the conditions for template matching as described in the problem. It needs to be revised to correctly implement the logic for determining if \(c\) does not match the template while \(a\) and \(b\) do.
