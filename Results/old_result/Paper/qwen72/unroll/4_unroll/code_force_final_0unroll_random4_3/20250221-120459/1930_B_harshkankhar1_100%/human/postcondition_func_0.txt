The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer from the user input, constructs a list `a` containing integers from 1 to the input integer (inclusive), and then reverses the elements at even indices of the list. Finally, it prints the modified list. The list `a` is printed such that elements at even indices are in descending order starting from the input integer, and elements at odd indices are in ascending order starting from 2. The function does not return any value.
