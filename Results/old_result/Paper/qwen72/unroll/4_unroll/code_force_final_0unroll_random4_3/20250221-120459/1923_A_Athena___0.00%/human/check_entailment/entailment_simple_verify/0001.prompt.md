You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with specific parameters for the problem, but the function definition provided does not include these parameters. For the problem described, the function should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept an integer `n` representing the number of cells, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1, where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. Additionally, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` contains at least one chip (1).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        print(a)
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is the last non-empty list of integers after removing leading and trailing zeros.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop: `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It also removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop: `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step is crucial because it ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips, which simplifies the problem.

3. **Counting Gaps**:
   - The program then iterates through the modified list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) between the chips.
   - The variable `res` is used to accumulate this count.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Single Block of Chips**:
  - If the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros contains no zeros, then all chips are already in a single block, and the result should be `0`.
  - This is correctly handled by the program.

- **Multiple Blocks of Chips**:
  - If the list `a` contains zeros, these zeros represent gaps between chips.
  - The number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block is equal to the number of these gaps.
  - The program correctly counts these gaps and prints the result.

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - There is one gap (one zero), so the result is `1`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
  - There are no gaps, so the result is `0`.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - There are no gaps, so the result is `0`.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - There are two gaps (two zeros), so the result is `2`.

- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - There are three gaps (three zeros), so the result is `3`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the problem by removing leading and trailing zeros and then counting the gaps between the chips. The logic and the implementation are correct for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
