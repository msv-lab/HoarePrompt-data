Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is an odd number. Specifically, the permutation generated by the program might still have two adjacent elements where the first divides the second.

For example, consider the input `n = 5`. The program will generate the permutation `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, `p_3 = 3` divides `p_4 = 4`, which violates the problem's requirement that there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the permutation generated does not have any such pairs for both even and odd `n`.
