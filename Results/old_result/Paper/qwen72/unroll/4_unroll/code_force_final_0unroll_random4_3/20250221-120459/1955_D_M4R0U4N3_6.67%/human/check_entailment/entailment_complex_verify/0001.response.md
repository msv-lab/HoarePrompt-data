### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is a set containing the elements of array `b`.
   - `done` is a set that will keep track of elements from `a` that match elements in `b` and are part of the current subsegment.
   - `extra` is a set that will keep track of elements from `a` that are not in `b` and are part of the current subsegment.

3. **First Subsegment**:
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates the `todo`, `done`, and `extra` sets accordingly.
   - If an element from `a` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element from `a` is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.
   - This initialization is correct and ensures that the sets are properly set up for the first subsegment.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, otherwise it initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element `a[r]`, it updates the sets by removing the element `a[r-m]` (the element that is no longer part of the current subsegment) and adding the new element `a[r]`.
   - If the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Initialization**:
  - The initial setup of the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` is correct. The first `m` elements of `a` are processed to determine which elements are in `b` and which are not.

- **Sliding Window Mechanism**:
  - The sliding window mechanism is implemented correctly. For each new element `a[r]` added to the current subsegment, the program correctly removes the element `a[r-m]` from the previous subsegment.
  - The updates to the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are performed correctly, ensuring that the sets always reflect the current subsegment.

- **Counting Good Subsegments**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of good subsegments by checking if the number of elements in `done` is at least `k` after each update of the sets.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `m` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to `m` correctly. In these cases, the program will still correctly count the subsegments.

### Potential Issues:

- **Set Operations**:
  - The use of sets for `todo`, `done`, and `extra` is efficient and appropriate for the operations performed (add, remove, and check membership).
  - There are no issues with the set operations that could lead to incorrect behavior.

- **Loop Invariants**:
  - The loop invariants are maintained correctly. The sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` are updated in a way that ensures the current subsegment is always correctly represented.
