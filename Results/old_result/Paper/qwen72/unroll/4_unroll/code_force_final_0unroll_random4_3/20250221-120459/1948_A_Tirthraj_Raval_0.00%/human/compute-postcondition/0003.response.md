The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is expected to process multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function returns the result of processing each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and returns the result of processing each test case.**
