Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Function Name and Input Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is called, but it reads `n` and `k` from the input, while the problem description specifies that the inputs should be `n` and `m`. This mismatch in variable names is a clear indication that the function is not correctly implemented for the given problem.

2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` does not match the problem's requirements. The problem asks to find the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the function calculates a different value:
   - It initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It then iterates from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` and updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i`.
   - This calculation does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The output of the function is `ans`, which is calculated using the incorrect logic mentioned above. The correct output should be the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
