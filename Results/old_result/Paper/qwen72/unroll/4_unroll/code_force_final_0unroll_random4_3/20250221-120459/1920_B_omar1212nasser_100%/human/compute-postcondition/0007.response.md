The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. 

- `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements)`.
- `elements` is a list of integers where each element is in the range `1 <= a_i <= 1000`.

The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the results of the expression `s - 2 * s2` calculated after each iteration of the loop. Here, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements plus the sum of the `negatives` elements that are `removals` positions before the end of the list.
