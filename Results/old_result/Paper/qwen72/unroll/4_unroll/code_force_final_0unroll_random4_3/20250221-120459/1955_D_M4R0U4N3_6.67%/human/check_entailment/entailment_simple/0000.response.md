### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list `a` of `n` integers and the list `b` of `m` integers.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `todo` with the elements of `b`. This set keeps track of the elements that need to be matched.
   - It also initializes two sets `done` and `extra`. `done` keeps track of the elements that have been matched, and `extra` keeps track of the elements that are not in `b`.

3. **First Subsegment:**
   - The program iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and updates `todo`, `done`, and `extra` accordingly.
   - If an element in the first `m` elements of `a` is in `todo`, it is removed from `todo` and added to `done`.
   - If an element is not in `todo`, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 if the first subsegment is good (i.e., if `len(done) >= k`), otherwise it initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements of `a` (from index `m` to `n-1`).
   - For each new element `a[r]`:
     - It removes the element `a[r - m]` from the previous subsegment from `extra` or `done` and updates `todo` if necessary.
     - It adds the new element `a[r]` to `done` if it is in `todo`, otherwise it adds it to `extra`.
     - It checks if the current subsegment is good by checking if `len(done) >= k`. If it is, it increments `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all subsegments for a test case, the program prints the value of `ans`.

6. **Resetting Variables:**
   - The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `todo`, `done`, `extra`, and `ans` are reset at the beginning of each test case, ensuring that the state is clean for each new test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of length `m` in `a` where at least `k` elements are present in `b`. The use of sets ensures efficient element addition and removal, and the sliding window approach is correctly applied to check each subsegment.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
