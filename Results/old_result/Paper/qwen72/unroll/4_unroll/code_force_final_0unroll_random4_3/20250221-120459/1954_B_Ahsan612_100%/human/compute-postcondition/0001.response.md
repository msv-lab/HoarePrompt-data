Output State: **For each test case, the loop will output the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number in the array `ar`. If the array is uniform (all elements are the same) or if no such segment exists, it will output -1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` will retain their initial values for the next test case, while `same`, `num`, `minn`, and `i` will be reset for each new test case.**
