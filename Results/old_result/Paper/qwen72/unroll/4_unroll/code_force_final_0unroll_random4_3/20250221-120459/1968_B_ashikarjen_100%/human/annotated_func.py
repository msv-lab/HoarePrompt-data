#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear, and `j` is the index in `b` where the last match was found or where the loop stopped if no more matches were found.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, followed by two strings `a` and `b`. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear. This count is stored in `k`. After processing, the function prints `k` and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the printed value of `k`, and the function has no effect on any external variables or state.
