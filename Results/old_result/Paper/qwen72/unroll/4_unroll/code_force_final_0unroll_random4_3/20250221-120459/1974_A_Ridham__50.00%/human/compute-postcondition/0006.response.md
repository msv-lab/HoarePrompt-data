Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. The function calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` cells of type 1 (each occupying 1 cell) and `y` cells of type 4 (each occupying 4 cells), with each screen capable of holding up to 15 cells. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
