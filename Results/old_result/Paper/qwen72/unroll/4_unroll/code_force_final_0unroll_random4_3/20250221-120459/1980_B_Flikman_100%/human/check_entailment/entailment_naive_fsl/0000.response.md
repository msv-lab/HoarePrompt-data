Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube has the same value as other cubes, and those cubes are removed, but the favorite cube is not. Specifically, the program incorrectly counts the number of times the favorite value is removed, without considering the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list.

Example case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```
- Expected Output: `MAYBE`
- Actual Output: `NO`

In this case, the favorite cube (index 2) has a value of 3. After sorting, the list could be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` or `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`. If the list is `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, the favorite cube is not removed, and the output should be `NO`. However, if the list is `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`, the favorite cube is removed, and the output should be `MAYBE`. The program incorrectly outputs `NO` in this case because it does not consider the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list.
