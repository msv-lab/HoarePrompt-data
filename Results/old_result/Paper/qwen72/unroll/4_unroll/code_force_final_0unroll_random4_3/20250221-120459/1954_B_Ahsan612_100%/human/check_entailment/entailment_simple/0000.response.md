### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, `minn` to infinity, and `i` to 1.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - If the array is uniform (all elements are the same) or if no such segment exists, it outputs -1.
   - Otherwise, it outputs the minimum length of the consecutive segments.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number.
   - However, the logic to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements is flawed.
   - The program only checks the minimum length of consecutive segments, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The minimum segment length is 1, but removing one element (e.g., the last element) makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.
   - The program should also check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \).
   - This can be achieved by removing elements from the array to break the pattern.
   - The program should find the minimum number of elements to remove to break all such patterns.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
