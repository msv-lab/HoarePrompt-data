The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other variables (t, n, m, a_i, b_i) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
