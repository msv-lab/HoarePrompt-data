You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a permutation of length n, where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. a is an array of length n, where each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, updating the positions and scores of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p` and the array `a`. After each test case, the loop prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is not defined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The loop completes all iterations, and the output state is the result of the comparisons for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`. It returns the result of the game for each test case, where `n` is the length of the permutation, `k` is the duration of the game, `P_B` and `P_S` are the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `p` is a permutation of length `n`, and `a` is an array of length `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
