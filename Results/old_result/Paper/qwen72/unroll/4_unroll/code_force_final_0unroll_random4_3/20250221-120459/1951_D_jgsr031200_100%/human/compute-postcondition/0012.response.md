To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `costs`.

1. **`costs`**: This is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`. For the loop to execute, `costs` must be non-empty. Given that `costs` is already defined with two elements, it is non-empty and the loop will execute at least once.

2. **`i`**: This variable will take on the values of the elements in `costs` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will be set to the first element of `costs` when the loop begins.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k.
- Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k.
- `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
- `h` is 0.

The loop will execute because `costs` is non-empty. The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `i` is set to the first element of `costs` before the loop starts.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k, n is greater than or equal to k, `costs` is a list with two elements: `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is 0, `i` is `n - k + 1`**
