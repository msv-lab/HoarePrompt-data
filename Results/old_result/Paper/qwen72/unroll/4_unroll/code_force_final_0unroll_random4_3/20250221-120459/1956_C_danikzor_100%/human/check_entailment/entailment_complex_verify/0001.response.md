### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - Nene can perform two types of operations: Type 1 (row operation) and Type 2 (column operation).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Each row and each column will have this sum, and since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

4. **Verification of Maximum Sum:**
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and the fact that each element in the matrix will be the sum of the row and column permutations.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 7 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 20 \).
   - These values match the expected maximum sums for the given problem.

5. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that no more than \( 2n \) operations are performed.
   - Each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Detailed Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

- **Output of Maximum Sum and Number of Operations:**
  - The program prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
  - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is correct for the maximum sum of the matrix.

- **Operations Execution:**
  - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
  - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **State of the Program Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function definition should include the parameter `n` to make it clear what it is working with.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function reads the size of the matrix \( n \) from user input.
  - It prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
  - It then iterates from 1 to \( n \), printing two lines for each iteration:
    - A Type 1 operation for each row \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
    - A Type 2 operation for each column \( i \) using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The formula used for the maximum sum is correct, and the operations are valid and within the allowed limit.
