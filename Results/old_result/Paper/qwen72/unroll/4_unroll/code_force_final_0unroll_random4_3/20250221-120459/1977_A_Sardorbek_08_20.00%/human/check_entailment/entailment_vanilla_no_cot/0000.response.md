Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the number of moves `b` and the target number of cubes `c` can result in the desired tower. Specifically, the condition `a % 2 == b % 2` is incorrect. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, and it should not be used in the logic to determine the correctness of each test case.

The correct condition should be based on the parity (odd or even nature) of `b` and `c`. If the difference between `b` and `c` is even, then it is possible to end up with exactly `c` cubes after `b` moves. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and the parity of the number of cubes in the tower will change with each move.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Reading**: The first line reads the number of test cases `t`.
- **Loop Through Test Cases**: The loop iterates `t` times to process each test case.
- **Condition Check**:
  - `n >= m`: This ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the target number of cubes.
  - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This checks if the difference between the number of moves and the target number of cubes is even. If it is, then it is possible to achieve the target number of cubes after `n` moves.
- **Output**: The program prints "Yes" if both conditions are met, otherwise it prints "No".

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for the given problem description.
