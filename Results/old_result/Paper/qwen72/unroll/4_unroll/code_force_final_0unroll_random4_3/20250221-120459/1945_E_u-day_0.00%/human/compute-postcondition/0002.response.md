Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing the permutation of size `n`, and all elements in `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, n]. `arr` is now the list of integers returned by `func_2()`, `pos` is -1.**

The code initializes the variable `pos` to -1. The values of `n` and `k` are still updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is still a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` with all elements being distinct and within the range [1, n]. However, `arr` is now the list of integers returned by `func_2()`.
