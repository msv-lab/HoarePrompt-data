Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`. For each of the `t` iterations, it reads four integers `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` from the input, where `0 <= a, b, c, d <= 200`. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if exactly three of these integers are odd. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t` and the input integers remain unchanged after the function execution. **
