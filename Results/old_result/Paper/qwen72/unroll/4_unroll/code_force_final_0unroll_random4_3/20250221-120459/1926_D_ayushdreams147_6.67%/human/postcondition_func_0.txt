The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It applies the transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each integer in the list and returns the number of unique integers in the transformed list. The function also modifies a dictionary `count` where each key is an integer from the list `a` or its transformed version, and the value is the count of how many times the transformed version of the key appears in the list, adjusted by the loop. However, the final state of `count` is not part of the function's return value.
