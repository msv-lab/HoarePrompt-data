#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, not as parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        dic = dict()
        
        ans = 0
        
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if i in dic:
                dic[i] -= 1
                if dic[i] == 0:
                    del dic[i]
            else:
                if s not in dic:
                    dic[s] = 0
                dic[s] += 1
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `times` is 0, `check` is 2147483647.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The function processes these integers and prints the number of unique integers that, when XORed with `2^31 - 1`, either do not exist in the input or appear an odd number of times. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `times` is 0 and `check` is `2147483647`.
