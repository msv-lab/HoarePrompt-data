The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is truthy (i.e., not 0, not `False`, not `None`, not an empty collection, etc.), the loop can execute. Given that `T` is an input integer, for the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^{15}, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `T` is a non-zero integer**
