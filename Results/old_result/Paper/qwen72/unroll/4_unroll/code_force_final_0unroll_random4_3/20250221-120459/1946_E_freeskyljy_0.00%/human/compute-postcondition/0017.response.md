To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i > 1`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`.
- `M1` is greater than 1.
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

The loop condition `i > 1` must be true for the loop to execute. Since `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`.

Let's break it down:
- `L[-1] - 1 > 1` simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

Since `L[-1]` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state of `L[-1]` to ensure this condition is met.

State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2**
