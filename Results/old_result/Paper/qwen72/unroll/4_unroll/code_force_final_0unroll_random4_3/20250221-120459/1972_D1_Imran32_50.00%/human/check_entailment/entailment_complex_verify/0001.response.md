### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program defines a function `func_1` that is called for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)) from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) and ensuring that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program instead seems to be calculating some unrelated values based on the square root of \(n\) and adding them to `ans`.
   - The loop and the calculation inside the loop do not match the conditions specified in the problem.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct output should be 14, as listed in the problem statement.
   - The program's logic does not match the required conditions, and it would produce an incorrect result for this test case.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - The function should take two positive integers \(n\) and \(m\) as inputs, where \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).
  - However, the function `func_1` reads \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)) from the input, indicating a potential naming issue.

- **Inside the function `func_1`**:
  - `n` and `k` (which should be \(m\)) are read from the input.
  - `ans` is initialized to \(n\).
  - `root` is calculated as the square root of \(n\) plus 1.
  - The loop iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
  - For each \(i\), `cnt` is calculated as \(i \cdot i\).
  - `ans` is updated by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
  - The final value of `ans` is printed.

- **State after the loop**:
  - `n` remains unchanged.
  - `k` (which should be \(m\)) remains unchanged.
  - `ans` is updated to `n` plus the sum of \((n + i) // (i \cdot i)\) for all \(i\) from 2 to `root` inclusive.
  - `root` remains unchanged.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
- The loop and the calculation inside the loop do not match the conditions specified in the problem.
- The program's output for the given test cases will be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It does not implement the necessary logic to check the conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

Final: **False**
