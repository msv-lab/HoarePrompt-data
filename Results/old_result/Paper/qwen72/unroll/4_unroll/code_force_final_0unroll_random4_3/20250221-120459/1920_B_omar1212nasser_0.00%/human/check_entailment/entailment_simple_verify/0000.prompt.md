You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` contains a hard-coded return statement for a specific case (`if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`), which is not a general solution and will fail for other inputs that should logically return a different result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
According to the problem description, Alice can remove all elements, and the sum of the array after the game would be 0. However, the program will not return 0 for this input because it will not reach the hard-coded condition and will instead proceed with the incorrect logic.

Additionally, the logic for handling the removal and negation of elements is flawed. The program does not correctly consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. For instance, Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should negate the largest elements to minimize the sum. The current logic does not always achieve this optimal strategy.
