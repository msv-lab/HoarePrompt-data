Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `b` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is the count of how many times the corresponding character in `a` has been appended to `r` in the loop.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer within the given range because the loop iterates `t` times, and `t` is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` is reset to a new value for each iteration of the outer loop, so it remains a positive integer within the given range.
- The string `a` is not modified and remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- The list `b` is modified within the inner loop. Each element in `b` corresponds to a character in `a`, and the value of each element in `b` is incremented each time the corresponding character is appended to `r`. Therefore, after the loop, `b` will contain 26 integers, each representing the count of how many times the corresponding character in `a` has been appended to `r`.
