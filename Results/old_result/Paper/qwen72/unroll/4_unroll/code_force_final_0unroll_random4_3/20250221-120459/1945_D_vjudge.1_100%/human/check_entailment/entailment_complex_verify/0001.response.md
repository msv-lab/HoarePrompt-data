### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a list `c` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is done to determine the minimum cost Kirill would have to pay to move past each person in the queue.
   - The list `suff` is then computed to store the suffix sums of the list `c`. Specifically, `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Cost:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity, which is a good starting point for finding the minimum cost.
   - It then iterates over the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to one of these positions. For each position `i` in the first `k` positions, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` if this cost is lower than the current `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Suffix Sum Calculation:**
  - The suffix sum `suff` is correctly calculated in reverse order, which allows the program to efficiently compute the total cost of moving past multiple people in the queue.
  - This ensures that the cost to move from position `i` to any position `j < i` is correctly accounted for.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost to move to position `i` is calculated as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which is the cost to bribe the person at position `i` plus the cost to bribe all people between positions `i + 1` and `n`.
  - This approach ensures that the minimum cost is found by considering all possible positions Kirill can move to within the first `k` positions.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is equal to `n` (i.e., Kirill can be in any position) correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is 1, meaning Kirill can only move to the first position, by correctly calculating the cost to move to the first position.

### Verification with Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le n \le 200,000\).
  - `a` and `b` are lists of integers of length `n`, where \(1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9\).

- **State After Suffix Sum Calculation:**
  - `suff` is a list of integers of length `n + 1` where `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, and `suff[n]` is 0.
  - This is correctly implemented and ensures that the suffix sums are computed efficiently.

- **State After Minimum Cost Calculation:**
  - `ans` is the minimum value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.
  - The list `suff` remains unchanged, which is expected as it is used for reference.

- **Final Output:**
  - The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case, which is the correct final output.

### Conclusion:

The program's logic and implementation are sound and correctly handle all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The annotated code confirms that the program's state and behavior are as expected at each key point.
