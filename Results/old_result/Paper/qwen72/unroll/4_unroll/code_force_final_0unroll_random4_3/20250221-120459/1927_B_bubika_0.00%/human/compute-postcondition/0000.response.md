Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**

Explanation: The variable `a` is reassigned to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', which is a fixed value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. The initial condition that `a` is a list of `n` integers is no longer valid, as `a` is now a string. The other preconditions regarding `t`, `n`, and the sum of `n` over all test cases remain valid.
