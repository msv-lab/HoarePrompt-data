ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
    #The program returns True if the string 's' is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to `func_2()`. Inside the function, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6). `x` is an integer initialized to -1.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.
        #
        #Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
        #Output:
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)
        return
        #The program returns `None`.
    #State: *`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s[0:])` returns True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns without any value.
    #State: If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: [s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring from the start of `s` up to and including the first character different from `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the substring from the position immediately after `x` to the end of `s`)
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: - The `print` statement is straightforward and does not depend on any variables or conditions from the precondition.
            #   - The integer `2` is printed directly.
            #
            #Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement is:
            #
            #Output:
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] ' ' s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring starting from the character at index x + 2 to the end)
        #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`. If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` if the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true, otherwise `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
