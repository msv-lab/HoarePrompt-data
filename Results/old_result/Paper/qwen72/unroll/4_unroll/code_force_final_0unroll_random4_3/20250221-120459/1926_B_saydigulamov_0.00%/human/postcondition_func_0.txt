The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `a` from the input, and for each value from 0 to `a-1`, it reads a series of strings (each representing a row of a grid) until it finds a row containing at least one '1'. It then counts the number of '1's in each such row and stores these counts in a list `k`. If the first two counts in `k` are equal, the list `k` is printed. The function does not modify the initial state of the program (i.e., `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged).
