Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. The preconditions are: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, f and k are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
