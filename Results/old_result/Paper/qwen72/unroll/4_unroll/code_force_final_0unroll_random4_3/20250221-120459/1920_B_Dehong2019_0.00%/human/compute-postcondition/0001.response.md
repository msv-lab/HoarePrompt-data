Output State: **t is an input integer, n, k, and x are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. No variables are affected by the code snippet.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user. The constraints and conditions for `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a_i` remain unchanged.
