Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

Explanation:
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input, where `input().split()` splits the input string into a list of strings, and `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer.
- The initial state mentions that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and this value remains unchanged.
- The initial state also mentions that `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and this value remains unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, along with the unchanged values of `t` and `chosen_vertices`.
