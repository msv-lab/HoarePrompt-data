### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.
   - Each query compares \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\), which is the length of the permutation \(p\).

3. **Finding the Maximum Element**:
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) to find the index \(v1\) of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).
   - If \((p_i \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{v1})\), it updates \(v1\) to \(i\).
   - **Annotation Validation**: This loop correctly identifies the index \(v1\) of the maximum element because \((p_i \mid p_i) = p_i\), and the loop updates \(v1\) to the index of the maximum element. The number of queries used in this loop is \(n-1\).

4. **Finding the Second Maximum Element**:
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) to find the index \(prev\) of the element that, when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), gives the maximum value.
   - It does this by comparing \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) > (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), it updates \(prev\) to \(i\).
   - If \((p_{v1} \mid p_i) = (p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\), it further checks \((p_i \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{prev} \mid p_{prev})\) to ensure the correct index is chosen.
   - **Annotation Validation**: This loop correctly identifies the index \(prev\) of the element that, when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), gives the maximum value. The additional check ensures that the correct index is chosen when the OR values are equal. The number of queries used in this loop is also \(n-1\).

5. **Query Count**:
   - The program uses \(n-1\) queries in the first loop and \(n-1\) queries in the second loop, totaling \(2n-2\) queries, which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

6. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the answer in the required format and flushes the output.
   - **Annotation Validation**: The output is correctly formatted and the output is flushed after each query and the final answer, ensuring the interactor receives the input correctly.

### Correctness:

- **Finding the Maximum Element**:
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index \(v1\) of the maximum element in the permutation. This is because \((p_i \mid p_i) = p_i\), and the loop updates \(v1\) to the index of the maximum element.

- **Finding the Second Maximum Element**:
  - The second loop correctly identifies the index \(prev\) of the element that, when XORed with \(p_{v1}\), gives the maximum value. This is because the loop compares \((p_{v1} \mid p_i)\) with \((p_{v1} \mid p_{prev})\) and updates \(prev\) accordingly. The additional check ensures that the correct index is chosen when the OR values are equal.

- **Query Count**:
  - The program uses \(2n-2\) queries, which is within the limit of \(3n\) queries.

- **Output**:
  - The program correctly prints the answer in the required format and flushes the output.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Final: **True**
