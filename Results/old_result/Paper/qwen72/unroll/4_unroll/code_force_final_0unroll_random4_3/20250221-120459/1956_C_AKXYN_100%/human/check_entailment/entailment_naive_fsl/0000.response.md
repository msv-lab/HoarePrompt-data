Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, for `n = 1`, the matrix is a 1x1 matrix, and the maximum sum is 1, which can be achieved with a single operation. However, the program outputs `1 2` (indicating that the maximum sum is 1 and it uses 2 operations), which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1 1` and a single operation.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
print(res, n << 1)
```
For `n = 1`, `n << 1` equals 2, which is more operations than necessary. The correct number of operations should be `1` for `n = 1`.

Additionally, the operations printed for `n = 1` are:
```
1 1 1
2 1 1
```
This is more than the required number of operations. The correct output should be:
```
1 1
1 1 1
```
