The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: an integer where 0 <= k <= 10^12, representing the number of coins.
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, where the result is based on the number of coins and the number of cards of each type.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is the number of distinct types of cards, `k` is the number of coins, and `a` is a list of the number of cards of each type. The function processes each test case and returns the result based on the given number of coins and the distribution of card types.**
