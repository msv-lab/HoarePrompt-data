Output State: **`times` is 0, `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation:
- The variable `times` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the outer loop, starting from `t`. After `t` iterations, `times` will be 0.
- The variable `check` is initialized to 2147483647 (which is \(2^{31} - 1\)) at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, so it remains 2147483647 after all iterations.
- The variables `n`, `data`, `dic`, and `ans` are reinitialized in each iteration of the outer loop and do not affect the state outside the loop. Therefore, they are not part of the output state.
