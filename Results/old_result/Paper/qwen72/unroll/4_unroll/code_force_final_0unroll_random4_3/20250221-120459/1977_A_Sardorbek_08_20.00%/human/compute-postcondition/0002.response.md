Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `a` times, and for each iteration, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from input. Depending on the values of `b` and `c`, it prints 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' as specified in the loop body. The variables `b`, `c`, and `q` are updated in each iteration, but their final values after the loop are the values from the last iteration.**
