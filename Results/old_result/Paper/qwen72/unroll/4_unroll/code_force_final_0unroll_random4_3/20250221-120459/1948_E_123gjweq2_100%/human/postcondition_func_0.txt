The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n. It divides the array `arr` of length `n` into `cliques` segments, where `cliques` is the ceiling of `n / k`. Each segment is filled with a unique value from 1 to `cliques`. The function prints the modified array `arr`, the number of segments `cliques`, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The parameters `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the function does not return any value.
