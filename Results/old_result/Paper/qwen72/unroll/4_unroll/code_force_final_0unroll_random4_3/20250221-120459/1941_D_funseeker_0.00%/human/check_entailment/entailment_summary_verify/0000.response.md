Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x` using `func_3()`.
   - It reads the distance `r` and direction `c` for each throw using `func_1()`.

2. **Throw Processing**:
   - The program initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` by considering the new possible positions:
     - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
     - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
   - This approach correctly handles the circular nature of the game using modulo operations.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program uses `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to ensure the player numbers wrap around correctly.
   - However, there is a subtle issue with the modulo operation for `(q - r) % n`. If `q - r` is negative, the result of the modulo operation will also be negative, which is not the desired behavior. To fix this, we should use `(q - r + n) % n` to ensure the result is always non-negative.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of possible players and the players themselves in increasing order.
   - It handles the edge case where the player number might be 0 by converting it to `n`.

5. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the player number might be 0 after a modulo operation.
   - It ensures that the set `ans` contains unique player numbers and outputs them in increasing order.

6. **Potential Issue**:
   - The issue with the negative result from the modulo operation in `(q - r) % n` can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `q = 1` and `r = 2`, then `(1 - 2) % 5` would result in `-1 % 5 = 4`, which is incorrect. The correct result should be `4` (i.e., `1 - 2 + 5 = 4`).

Given the above reasoning, the program is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the modulo operation for counterclockwise throws. This issue can be fixed by using `(q - r + n) % n` instead of `(q - r) % n`.

Final: **False**

To correct the program, the line:
```python
temp.add((q - r) % n)
```
should be changed to:
```python
temp.add((q - r + n) % n)
```

Here is the corrected version of `func_4`:

```python
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r + n) % n)  # Corrected line
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))  # Ensure the output is in increasing order
```

With this correction, the program should be correct and handle all cases as specified in the problem description.
