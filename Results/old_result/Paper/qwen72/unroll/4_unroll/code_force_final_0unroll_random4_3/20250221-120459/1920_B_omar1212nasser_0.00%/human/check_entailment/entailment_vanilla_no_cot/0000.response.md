Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Special Case Handling**:
   - In `func_2`, there is a special case check: `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`. This is not a general solution and only handles a specific input, which is not appropriate for a problem that requires a general solution.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Bob's Moves**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum after Bob's moves is flawed. Bob should ideally choose the smallest elements to multiply by -1 to minimize the sum. However, the current implementation incorrectly tries to adjust the sum by subtracting and adding elements in a way that does not always result in the optimal solution.

3. **Handling of Negative Elements**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the array contains negative elements. Bob should be able to flip the smallest elements (which could be negative) to maximize the reduction in the sum.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should flip the smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum. The current implementation does not follow this optimal strategy.

### Correct Approach:
- **Alice's Move**: Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements from the array to maximize the sum.
- **Bob's Move**: Bob should then flip the smallest `x` elements of the remaining array to minimize the sum.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        a = a[k:]  # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a.sort(key=lambda x: abs(x))  # Bob sorts by absolute value to flip the smallest in magnitude
        for j in range(x):
            a[j] = -a[j]  # Bob flips the smallest x elements
        print(sum(a))

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Alice's Move**: After sorting the array, Alice removes the smallest `k` elements by slicing the array from index `k` to the end.
- **Bob's Move**: Bob then sorts the remaining elements by their absolute values and flips the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum.
- **Final Sum**: The sum of the modified array is printed for each test case.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally according to the problem description.
