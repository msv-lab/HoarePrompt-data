Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2

    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, `j` is the position in `b` after the last matched character, and the loop breaks when `j` reaches `m` or all characters in `a` are processed.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, expecting two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the user. The function calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not handle multiple test cases as indicated in the comments; it processes only a single set of inputs. After the function concludes, `k` is printed, and the program state is unchanged except for the input and output operations.
