The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it should start at 0.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 10^5, and each a_i is a distinct integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`; `ind` is an empty list; `c` is 0; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
