Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`, and `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`, then prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
