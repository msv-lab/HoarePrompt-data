Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all test cases. For each test case, if n > 1, the minimum value between `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` is printed. If n == 1, the value of `a` is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state.**
