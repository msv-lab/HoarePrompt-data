### Reasoning:

1. **String Construction:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to an empty string and `work` to `True`, indicating the grasshopper starts on the first row.
   - It iterates through the columns of the grid, adding characters to `ans` based on the current value of `work`.
   - If `work` is `True`, it adds the character from the first row `a[i]` to `ans`.
   - If `b[i]` is lexicographically smaller than `a[i + 1]` and `i + 1 < len(a)`, it switches to the second row by setting `work` to `False`.
   - If `i + 1 == len(a)`, it adds the last character from the second row `b[i]` to `ans` and breaks the loop.
   - If `work` is `False`, it adds the character from the second row `b[i]` to `ans` and increments `i`.

   **Issue:**
   - The logic for switching rows is not entirely correct. The program should switch to the second row as soon as it finds a smaller character in `b` compared to the current character in `a`, not just the next character in `a`.
   - This means the condition `b[i] < a[i + 1]` should be `b[i] < a[i]` to ensure the grasshopper always takes the lexicographically smallest path at each step.

2. **Path Counting:**
   - The program initializes `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the columns to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is the same as `b[j]`, it increments the counter.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '1' and `b[j]` is '0', it breaks the loop.

   **Issue:**
   - The path counting logic is not entirely correct. The program should count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string, but the current logic only considers the first time the grasshopper can switch rows.
   - The correct approach should be to count the number of valid paths that follow the lexicographically smallest string. This involves checking all possible paths that can form the string `ans`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        ans = ''
        i = 0
        work = True
        while i < len(a):
            if work:
                ans += a[i]
                if b[i] < a[i]:
                    work = False
            else:
                ans += b[i]
            i += 1
        print(ans)
        
        counter = 0
        for j in range(len(a)):
            if a[j] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            else:
                break
        if counter == len(a):
            counter += 1  # Account for the last character in the second row
        print(counter)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **String Construction:**
  - The corrected condition `b[i] < a[i]` ensures that the grasshopper switches to the second row as soon as it finds a smaller character in `b`.
- **Path Counting:**
  - The path counting logic is simplified to count the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` up to the point where they differ.
  - If all characters match, it adds 1 to account for the last character in the second row.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** due to the incorrect logic for switching rows and the flawed path counting mechanism. The corrected code ensures that the grasshopper always takes the lexicographically smallest path and correctly counts the number of such paths.

Final: **False**
