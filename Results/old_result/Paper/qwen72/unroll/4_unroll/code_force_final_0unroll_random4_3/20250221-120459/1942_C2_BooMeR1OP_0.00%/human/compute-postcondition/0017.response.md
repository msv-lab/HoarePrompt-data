Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input values for `n`, `x`, and `y` from the user, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It then calculates the number of additional vertices that can be chosen to form a convex polygon with Bessie's chosen vertices, under the constraint that at most `y` additional vertices can be selected. The function prints the total number of ways to choose these additional vertices. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices, along with the calculated and printed value of `ans`. **
