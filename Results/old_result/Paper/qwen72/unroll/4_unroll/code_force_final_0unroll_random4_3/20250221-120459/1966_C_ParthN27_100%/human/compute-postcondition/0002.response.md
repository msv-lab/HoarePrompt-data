The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `piles`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each inner list in `piles` contains `n` integers, where each integer represents the number of stones in each pile for a test case. The constraints are as follows: `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, and each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the number of stones in the piles for that test case.
