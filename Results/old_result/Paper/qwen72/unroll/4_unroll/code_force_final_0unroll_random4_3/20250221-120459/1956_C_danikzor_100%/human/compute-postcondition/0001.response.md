Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving an n x n matrix, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Print Statement:
```
print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
```

### Analysis:
1. **First Expression: `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`**
   - This expression calculates a value based on the integer `n`.
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is a known formula for the sum of the first `n` triangular numbers.
   - The result of this expression will be an integer because the division operator `//` performs integer division.

2. **Second Expression: `2 * n`**
   - This expression simply multiplies `n` by 2.
   - The result of this expression will be an integer.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output two values separated by a comma:
- The first value is the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
- The second value is the result of the expression `2 * n`.

Since `n` is an input integer, the exact numerical values will depend on the value of `n`. However, we can describe the output in terms of `n`.

Output: **n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)**
