The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the presence of the value at index `f-1` in the top `k` largest values of the list `a`. If all occurrences of this value are among the top `k` largest values, it prints 'YES'. If none of the occurrences are among the top `k` largest values, it prints 'NO'. If some but not all occurrences are among the top `k` largest values, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value.
