### Reasoning:

1. **Lexicographically Smallest String Construction**:
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by starting at the top-left cell and moving right or down based on the values in the grid.
   - The variable `work` is used to decide whether to move right in the top row (`a`) or down to the bottom row (`b`).
   - The condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]` ensures that the program moves down to the bottom row if the next cell in the top row has a larger value than the current cell in the bottom row. This helps in constructing the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The program correctly appends the current cell's value to `ans` and increments `i` or sets `work` to `False` as needed.

2. **Counting Paths**:
   - The program initializes `counter` to 1, which is the correct initial value since there is at least one path.
   - It then iterates through the grid to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - The condition `if a[j + 1] == b[j]` checks if the next cell in the top row matches the current cell in the bottom row, allowing the grasshopper to switch rows without changing the string.
   - The condition `elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1'` resets the counter if the next cell in the top row is '0' and the current cell in the bottom row is '1', which is necessary to ensure the count is accurate.
   - The `else` block breaks the loop if the conditions are not met, which is correct because it stops counting paths that no longer match the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2, as shown in the first test case.
   - It also handles the case where the strings `a` and `b` are different and the grasshopper needs to switch rows to find the lexicographically smallest string.

5. **Complexity**:
   - The program runs in linear time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The total complexity is \(O(t \times n)\), which is within the acceptable range given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string. It handles all edge cases and input/output as specified in the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
