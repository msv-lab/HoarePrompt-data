Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly determine whether the shape drawn on the grid is a square or a triangle. Instead, it only checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal and prints the list of counts if they are. This approach is insufficient for the problem requirements, which demand that the program output "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE" based on the shape formed by the '1's in the grid. The provided test cases clearly show that the program fails to produce the correct output format and does not correctly identify the shapes as specified.

Final: **False**
