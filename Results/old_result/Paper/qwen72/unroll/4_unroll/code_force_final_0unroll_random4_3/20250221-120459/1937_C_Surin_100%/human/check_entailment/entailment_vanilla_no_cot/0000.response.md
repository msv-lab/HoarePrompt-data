Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correctly solving the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is considered correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR**:
   - The program initializes `v1` to 0.
   - It iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and for each `i`, it queries the comparison between `p_v1 | p_v1` and `p_i | p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This step ensures that `v1` is the index of the element with the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR**:
   - The program initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` and for each `i`, it queries the comparison between `p_v1 | p_i` and `p_v1 | p_prev`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further queries the comparison between `p_i | p_i` and `p_prev | p_prev` to ensure the correct update of `prev`.

4. **Outputting the Result**:
   - After the iterations, the program outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the pair that maximizes `p_i \oplus p_j`.
   - The program flushes the output after each query and the final answer to ensure proper interaction with the interactor.

The program adheres to the constraints and the interaction rules specified in the problem description. It uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit. The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is sound and follows the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
