### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Matrix Initialization:**
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized as an `n x n` matrix where each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - This initialization is correct and aligns with the problem's constraints.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The variable `res` is used to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.
   - The formula used to calculate `res` is:
     ```python
     res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
     ```
   - This formula is derived from the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the matrix. For a matrix of size `n`, the maximum sum is indeed the sum of the series \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\).

4. **Output of Sum and Number of Operations:**
   - The program prints `res` and `n << 1` (which is `2 * n`).
   - For `n = 1`, `res` is correctly calculated as 1, but `n << 1` is 2, which is incorrect. The correct number of operations should be 1.

5. **Operations Output:**
   - The program prints `2 * n` operations, which is more than necessary for `n = 1`.
   - For `n = 1`, the operations should be:
     ```
     1 1 1
     ```
   - However, the program prints:
     ```
     1 1 1
     2 1 1
     ```
   - This is incorrect because it performs an unnecessary operation.

### Evaluation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the case when `n = 1` properly.
- The program outputs `1 2` instead of `1 1` for the number of operations, which is incorrect.
- The operations printed for `n = 1` are also incorrect, as they include an unnecessary operation.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program is incorrect for the case when `n = 1` due to the incorrect number of operations and the unnecessary operation printed.
- For other values of `n`, the program may still be correct, but the issue with `n = 1` is sufficient to mark the program as incorrect.

Final: **False**
