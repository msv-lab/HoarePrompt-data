The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the array, and two integers `k` and `x` representing the limits on the number of elements Alice can remove and Bob can multiply by -1, respectively. The list `a` should contain at least 1 and at most 2 * 10^5 elements, each element `a_i` should be a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000), and `k` and `x` should be non-negative integers such that 1 ≤ k, x ≤ len(a). Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of the lengths of the arrays across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
