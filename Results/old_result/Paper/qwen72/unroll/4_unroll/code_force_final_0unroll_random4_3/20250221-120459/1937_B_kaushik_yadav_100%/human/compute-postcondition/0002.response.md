To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop to iterate a certain number of times, which is determined by `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is the number of test cases read from standard input.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is just a placeholder for the loop iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
