Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each case.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: If `n` is odd, the program prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters come in pairs (e.g., AA, BB).

3. **Even `n` Handling**: If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES' and constructs a string that meets the criteria. The pattern used is alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, ensuring that each 'A' is followed by a 'B' and each 'B' is followed by an 'A'. This pattern ensures that every character in the string is a special character, and the length of the string is exactly `n`.

4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern is constructed using a loop that appends 'A' and 'B' alternately to the list `pattern`. The use of `i % 2` and `i % 2 ^ 1` ensures that the characters alternate correctly.

5. **String Output**: The constructed pattern is then joined into a single string and printed.

The program ensures that the output string is of length at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints. The example provided in the problem description is also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
