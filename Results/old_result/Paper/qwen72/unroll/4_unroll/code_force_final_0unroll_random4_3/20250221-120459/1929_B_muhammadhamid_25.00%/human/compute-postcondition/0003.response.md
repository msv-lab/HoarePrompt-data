Functionality: ** The function reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from user input, where each pair is on a new line. For each pair, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, it prints 1. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`. Otherwise, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each input pair. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes without retaining any state. **
