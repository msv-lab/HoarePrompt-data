The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. The specifics of the return values are not provided, but it is expected that the function will return some form of output for each test case, considering the constraints and the nature of the problem.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a result for each test case.**
