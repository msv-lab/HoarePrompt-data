### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of cell states `a`.

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program removes leading zeros from the list `a` using a while loop: `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It also removes trailing zeros from the list `a` using another while loop: `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - This step is crucial because it ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips, which simplifies the problem.

3. **Counting Gaps**:
   - The program then iterates through the modified list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) between the chips.
   - The variable `res` is used to accumulate this count.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Single Block of Chips**:
  - If the list `a` after removing leading and trailing zeros contains no zeros, then all chips are already in a single block, and the result should be `0`.
  - This is correctly handled by the program.

- **Multiple Blocks of Chips**:
  - If the list `a` contains zeros, these zeros represent gaps between chips.
  - The number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block is equal to the number of these gaps.
  - The program correctly counts these gaps and prints the result.

### Example Verification:

- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 0 1 1`
  - There is one gap (one zero), so the result is `1`.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `0 1 0 0 0 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1`
  - There are no gaps, so the result is `0`.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - There are no gaps, so the result is `0`.

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 0 1 0 1`
  - There are two gaps (two zeros), so the result is `2`.

- **Example 5**:
  - Input: `0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
  - After removing leading and trailing zeros: `1 1 0 0 0 1 1`
  - There are three gaps (three zeros), so the result is `3`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the problem by removing leading and trailing zeros and then counting the gaps between the chips. The logic and the implementation are correct for the given problem description.
