Output State: **The loop will have finished executing, and for each test case, it will have printed either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions described in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` will retain their initial values, but the variables `s` and `ans` will have been modified and reset for each test case. After the loop, `s` will be a sorted list of unique elements from the last test case, with a 0 prepended, and `ans` will be either 0 or 1, depending on the last test case's result.**
