### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by a grasshopper jumping from the top-left cell (1, 1) to the bottom-right cell (2, n) in a 2 × n grid.
   - We also need to count the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b` representing the two rows of the grid.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest string and a boolean `work` to determine the current row the grasshopper is on (initially on the first row).

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program iterates through the columns of the grid.
   - If `work` is `True`, it adds the character from the first row `a[i]` to `ans`.
   - If the next character in the second row `b[i]` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in the first row `a[i + 1]`, it switches to the second row by setting `work` to `False`.
   - If the grasshopper is on the second row (`work` is `False`), it adds the character from the second row `b[i]` to `ans`.

4. **Path Counting:**
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It iterates through the columns to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.
   - If the characters in the next column of the first row `a[j + 1]` and the current column of the second row `b[j]` are the same, it increments the counter.
   - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - If the characters differ and `a[j + 1]` is '1' and `b[j]` is '0', it breaks the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans`.
   - It prints the number of paths that yield this string.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **String Construction:**
  - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the smaller character between the current column of the first row and the next column of the second row.
  - This ensures that the string is as small as possible at each step.

- **Path Counting:**
  - The path counting logic is correct. It counts the number of paths by checking if the characters in the next column of the first row and the current column of the second row are the same.
  - If they are the same, it increments the counter.
  - If they differ and the next column of the first row is '0' and the current column of the second row is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
  - If they differ and the next column of the first row is '1' and the current column of the second row is '0', it breaks the loop, as this indicates that the path cannot continue to yield the lexicographically smallest string.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the grid is 2 × 2 correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the grasshopper needs to switch rows correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
