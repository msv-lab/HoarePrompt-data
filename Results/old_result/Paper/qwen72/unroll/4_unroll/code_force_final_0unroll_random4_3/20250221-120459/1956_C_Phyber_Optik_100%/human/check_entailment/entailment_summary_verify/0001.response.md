### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is achieved when each element \( a_{i, j} \) is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

3. **Operations to Achieve Maximum Sum**:
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can set each row and each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This can be done by performing \( n \) Type 1 operations (one for each row) and \( n \) Type 2 operations (one for each column), totaling \( 2n \) operations.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It calculates the sum using the formula \( \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i \).
     - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n^3 \).
   - It prints the sum and \( 2n \) operations.
   - It then prints \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

5. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations themselves are correct. They set each row and each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which is a valid way to achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Correctness of Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The program should calculate the sum as \( n^3 \) instead of using the given formula.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the sum calculation is incorrect. The program should calculate the sum as \( n^3 \) to correctly determine the maximum sum for the matrix. However, the operations to achieve the maximum sum are correctly implemented.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to the incorrect sum calculation.

Final: **False**
