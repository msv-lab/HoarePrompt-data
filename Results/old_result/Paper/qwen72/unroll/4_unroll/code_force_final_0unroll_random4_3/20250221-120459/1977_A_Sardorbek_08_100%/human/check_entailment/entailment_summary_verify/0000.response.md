### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution step by step to evaluate its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
- **Input:** Multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `m`.
- **Output:** For each test case, determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
- **Constraints:** \(1 \le t \le 100\), \(1 \le n, m \le 100\).

#### Key Observations:
1. **Initial State:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves:** Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
3. **Final State:** After `n` moves, the tower can have a height of `n` (if all moves are additions) or `0` (if all moves are removals), or any height in between that is reachable by a combination of additions and removals.
4. **Reachability:** The height of the tower after `n` moves must be an integer that is reachable by adding and removing cubes. Specifically, the height must be within the range \([0, n]\) and must have the same parity (even or odd) as `n`.

#### Program Analysis:
- **Reading Input:** The function reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates `a` times to read pairs of integers `b` and `c`.
- **Conditions:**
  - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES' because it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves if `n` equals `m`.
  - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
  - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes' because `n` and `m` have the same parity, which means it is possible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.
  - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func` reads input and processes each test case.
- It correctly identifies the cases where `n` equals `m` and where `n` is less than `m`.
- It also correctly checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity.

#### Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m`.
- However, the program does handle this case correctly with the condition `if b < c: print('NO')`.

#### Additional Considerations:
- The program correctly checks if `n` and `m` have the same parity, which is a necessary condition for `m` to be reachable after `n` moves.
- The program also correctly handles the case where `n` equals `m`.

#### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is sound and covers all necessary conditions for determining if a tower with `m` cubes can be built after `n` moves.
- The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
