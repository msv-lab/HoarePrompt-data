Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which represents the number of test cases. However, the program hard-codes the number of test cases to 10, which will cause it to fail if `t` is not 10. For example, if `t` is 5, the program will still attempt to read 10 lines of input, leading to an error when it tries to read more lines than are provided. Additionally, the program does not validate the input to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, which is a potential edge case that is not handled.
