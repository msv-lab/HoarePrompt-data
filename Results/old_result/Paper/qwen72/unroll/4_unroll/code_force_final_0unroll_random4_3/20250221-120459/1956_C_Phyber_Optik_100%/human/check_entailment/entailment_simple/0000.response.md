Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The function calculates the sum of the matrix elements as follows:
   - It initializes `sum` to 1.
   - For each `i` from 2 to `n`, it adds `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to `sum`.
   - This formula simplifies to `i * (2 * i - 1)`, which is the sum of the first `i` odd numbers multiplied by `i`. This is a correct way to calculate the sum of the matrix elements if each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Output of Sum and Number of Operations**: The function prints the calculated sum and `2 * n` (the number of operations).

4. **Operations Output**: The function then prints the operations:
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, it prints two lines:
     - The first line starts with `1` (indicating a row operation) and `n - j + 1` (the row index), followed by the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - The second line starts with `2` (indicating a column operation) and `n - j + 1` (the column index), followed by the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - Since each row and column will contain the numbers from 1 to `n` exactly once, the sum of the matrix will be `n * n * (n + 1) / 2`, which is the maximum possible sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with the numbers 1 to `n`.

6. **Number of Operations**: The function ensures that the number of operations is exactly `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly outputs `1 1` and a single operation, which is the correct and only possible operation to fill the 1x1 matrix with the number 1.
   - For larger `n`, the function correctly calculates the sum and outputs the operations as required.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
