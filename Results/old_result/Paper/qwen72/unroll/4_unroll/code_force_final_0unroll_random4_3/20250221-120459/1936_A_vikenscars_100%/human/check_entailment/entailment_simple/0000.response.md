### Reasoning:

1. **Objective of the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, using at most \(3n\) queries.

2. **Understanding the Query Mechanism:**
   - Each query involves four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and returns a comparison between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - The bitwise OR operation (\(\mid\)) is used to compare the values, but the final goal is to maximize the bitwise XOR operation (\(\oplus\)).

3. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives the comparison result.
   - It correctly formats the query and prints it with flushing, ensuring the interactor receives it.
   - It reads the response from the interactor and returns it.

4. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - **Finding the Maximum Item Index:**
     - The first loop iterates through all indices \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
     - If \((p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}}) < (p_i \mid p_i)\), it updates \(\text{max\_item\_idx}\) to \(i\).
     - This loop ensures that \(\text{max\_item\_idx}\) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation \(p\).

   - **Finding the Pair with Maximum XOR:**
     - The second loop iterates through all indices \(i\) from 0 to \(n-1\) and compares \((p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}})\) with \((p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i)\).
     - If \((p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}}) < (p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i)\), it updates \(\text{pair\_idx}\) to \(i\).
     - If \((p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}}) = (p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i)\), it makes an additional query to compare \((p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) to break the tie.
     - This loop ensures that \(\text{pair\_idx}\) is the index that maximizes the XOR with \(\text{max\_item\_idx}\).

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes up to \(n\) queries (one for each \(i\), and potentially one more for the tie-breaking comparison).
   - The total number of queries is \(2n-1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices \(\text{max\_item\_idx}\) and \(\text{pair\_idx}\) as the final answer.
   - This output is in the correct format and is not considered a query.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic. It uses a reasonable number of queries to find the indices that maximize the XOR operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
