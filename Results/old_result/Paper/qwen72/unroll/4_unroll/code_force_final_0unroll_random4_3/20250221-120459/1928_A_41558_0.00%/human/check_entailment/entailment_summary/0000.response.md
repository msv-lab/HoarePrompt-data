### Reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**:
   - If both dimensions `a` and `b` are odd, it is impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. This is because any cut parallel to one of the sides will result in at least one of the resulting rectangles having a non-integer side. Therefore, the program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

2. **Exact Half Check**:
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other (i.e., `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`), the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original rectangle after the cut. For example, a 2x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, but these two 2x2 rectangles can only form a 2x4 rectangle again, which is the same as the original. The program correctly prints 'NO' in this case.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it is possible to form a different rectangle. For example, a 2x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x6 rectangle. The program correctly prints 'YES' in this case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem. It checks for the conditions where Bob cannot form a different rectangle and prints 'NO' in those cases, and it prints 'YES' otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
