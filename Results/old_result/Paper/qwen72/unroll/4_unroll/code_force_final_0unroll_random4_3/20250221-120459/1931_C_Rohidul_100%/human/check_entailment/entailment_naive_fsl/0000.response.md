Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array has a single unique element that is not at the beginning or the end of the array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

The expected output should be `3` because the minimum cost to make all elements equal is to select `i = 2`, `j = 3`, and `x = 2`, which will change the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then select `i = 1`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2`, which will change the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]` with a total cost of `3` burles. However, the program will output `1` because it only considers the longest contiguous segments at the beginning or the end of the array, and it does not account for the possibility of a single unique element in the middle.
