The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `l` is 1.
- `r` is `n // k`.

For the loop to execute the first time, `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`. Since `l` is 1, `r` must be greater than or equal to 1. This means that `n // k` must be greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` to ensure that `r` is at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list `g[a]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and `g[b]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `b` by an edge. `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k` and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**
