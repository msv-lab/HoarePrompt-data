Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remaining extroverts (extroverts % 3) plus the number of universals is at least 3 to form a complete tent. If this condition is not met, it returns `None` indicating that it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as required.
   - It then returns the ceiling of the total number of extroverts and universals divided by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed for the extroverts and universals.

2. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function combines the results of `func_1` with the number of introverts.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns -1.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents needed.

The program handles all the test cases correctly:
- For `1 2 3`, it correctly returns `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
- For `1 4 1`, it correctly returns `-1` (since 4 extroverts require 3 more people to form complete tents, but only 1 universal is available).
- For `1 4 2`, it correctly returns `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 extrovert and 2 universals).
- For `1 1 1`, it correctly returns `-1` (since 1 extrovert requires 2 more people to form a complete tent, but only 1 universal is available).
- For `1 3 2`, it correctly returns `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
- For `19 7 18`, it correctly returns `28` (19 tents for introverts, 7 tents for extroverts and universals, and 1 tent for the remaining 1 universal).
- For `0 0 0`, it correctly returns `0` (no participants, no tents needed).
- For `7 0 0`, it correctly returns `7` (7 introverts, 7 tents needed).
- For `0 24 0`, it correctly returns `8` (24 extroverts, 8 tents needed).
- For `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, it correctly returns `1666666667` (1000000000 tents for introverts, 333333333 tents for extroverts and universals, and 333333334 tents for the remaining universals).

Thus, the program is correct and fulfills the requirements of the problem.
