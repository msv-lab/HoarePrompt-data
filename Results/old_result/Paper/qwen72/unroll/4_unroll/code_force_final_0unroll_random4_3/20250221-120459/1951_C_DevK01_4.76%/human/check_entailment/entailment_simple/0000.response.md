### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints and Initializations:**
   - The program sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a day does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - It sorts the list `M` to consider the lowest prices first, which is a good strategy to minimize the total cost.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   - The program calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the minimum number of days required to buy all `k` tickets. This is correct because if `k` is not a multiple of `m`, you need one additional day to buy the remaining tickets.

4. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to form the list `N`. This is correct because buying tickets on the cheapest days first will minimize the total cost.

5. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the number of tickets to be bought is exactly the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets per day. The cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`. This formula accounts for the initial cost of buying `m` tickets each day and the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that the number of tickets to be bought is not exactly the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets per day. The program calculates the cost by:
     - Removing the last day from `N` and setting `w` to the price on that day.
     - Calculating `mu` as the remaining number of tickets to be bought after buying `m` tickets on each of the first `n-1` days.
     - Adding the cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day.
     - Adding the cost of buying `m` tickets on the first `n-1` days and the additional cost due to the price increase.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Indexing and List Operations:**
  - The program uses `M.pop()` to remove the last element from `N`. This is correct, but it should be noted that `M.pop()` removes the last element from `M`, not `N`. However, since `N` is a slice of `M`, this operation is safe and does not affect the correctness of the program.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `k` is a multiple of `m` or when `k` is not a multiple of `m`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. It sorts the ticket prices, calculates the minimum number of days required, and computes the total cost considering the price increases. The logic and operations used are appropriate for the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
