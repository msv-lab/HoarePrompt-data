Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with specific parameters for the problem, but the function definition provided does not include these parameters. For the problem described, the function should accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should accept an integer `n` representing the number of cells, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1, where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. Additionally, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` contains at least one chip (1).**
