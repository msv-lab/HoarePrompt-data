The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is implied that the function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where each test case provides an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The function returns a matrix of size `n x n`.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. When called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each providing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500), it returns a matrix of size `n x n`.**
