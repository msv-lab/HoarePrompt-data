The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It computes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and elements of the reversed sorted list `b`. The function prints the sum for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not modified by the function, and the final state of the program is the printed sum for each test case.
