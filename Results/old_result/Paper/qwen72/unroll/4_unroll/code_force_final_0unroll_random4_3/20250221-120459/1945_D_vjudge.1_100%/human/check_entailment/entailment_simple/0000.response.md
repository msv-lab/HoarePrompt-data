### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` as arguments.
   - Inside `func_1`, a new list `c` is created where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is a valid step because it helps in determining the minimum cost Kirill can pay to move to a position.

3. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
   - The list `suff` is initialized to store the suffix sums of the list `c`.
   - The suffix sum `suff[i]` is calculated as the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
   - This is a correct approach because it allows us to efficiently calculate the total cost of moving Kirill to any position `i` by summing the costs from `i+1` to `n-1`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity to find the minimum cost.
   - The program iterates over the first `k` positions and calculates the cost for Kirill to move to each position `i` as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`.
   - The minimum of these costs is stored in `ans`.
   - This is a correct approach because it ensures that Kirill will be among the first `k` positions and the cost is minimized.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost `ans` for each test case.
   - This is the correct output format as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `k` people in the queue. The steps are logically sound and follow the problem constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
