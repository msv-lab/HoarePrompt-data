### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by reading an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `b` and `c` for each case.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1: `b == c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired tower height. This is always possible.
     - The program correctly prints "YES" in this case.
   
   - **Case 2: `b < c`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` is less than the desired number of cubes `c`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `c` because Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves he has.
     - The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   
   - **Case 3: `b % 2 == c % 2`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd), it is possible to build a tower of height `c` after `b` moves.
     - This is because:
       - If both `b` and `c` are even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with an even number of cubes.
       - If both `b` and `c` are odd, Nikita can add and remove cubes in pairs to end up with an odd number of cubes.
     - The program correctly prints "Yes" in this case.
   
   - **Case 4: `b % 2 != c % 2`**:
     - If the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have different parities (one is even and the other is odd), it is impossible to build a tower of height `c` after `b` moves.
     - This is because:
       - Adding or removing one cube at a time will always change the parity of the number of cubes.
       - Therefore, if `b` and `c` have different parities, the final number of cubes will never match `c`.
     - The program correctly prints "No" in this case.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results in the correct format, either "Yes" or "No" for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and outputs the correct results for each test case based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
