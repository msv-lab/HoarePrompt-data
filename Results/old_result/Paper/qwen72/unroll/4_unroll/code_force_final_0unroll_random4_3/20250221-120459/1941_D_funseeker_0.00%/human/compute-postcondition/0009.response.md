To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations described:

### Initial State:
- `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- `ans` is a set that may or may not contain the value `0`.
- If `0` is in the set `ans`, then `ans` is updated to contain all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding the value `0`, and `n` is added to the set `ans`.
- If `0` is not in the set `ans`, then `ans` is updated to contain all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check if `0` is in `ans`**:
   - If `0` is in `ans`, the set `ans` is updated to include all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations, excluding the value `0`. Additionally, `n` is added to the set `ans`.
   - If `0` is not in `ans`, the set `ans` is updated to include all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.

2. **Understanding the Update**:
   - The values of `r` and `c` are returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.
   - For each `q` in the initial set `ans`, the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` are computed and added to the set `ans`.
   - If `0` is in the initial set `ans`, it will be excluded from the updated set `ans`.
   - If `0` is not in the initial set `ans`, all computed values will be added to `ans`.

3. **Final Set `ans`**:
   - The final set `ans` will contain all the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.
   - If `0` was initially in `ans`, it will be excluded from the final set, and `n` will be added to the set.

4. **Output of `print(*ans)`**:
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all the elements of the set `ans` separated by spaces.
   - The elements of `ans` will be the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` as described above.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `q`, `r`, `c`, and the initial set `ans` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the operations and conditions given.

Output: **all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial set ans and each r and c returned by func_1() during the m iterations, excluding 0 if it was initially in ans, and including n if 0 was initially in ans**
