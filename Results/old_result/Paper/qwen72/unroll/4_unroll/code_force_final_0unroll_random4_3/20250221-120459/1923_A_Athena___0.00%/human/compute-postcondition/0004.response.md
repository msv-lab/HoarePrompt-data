Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers 0 or 1. The function then removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` and prints the modified list. It calculates and prints the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` after the removal of leading and trailing zeros. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is the last non-empty list of integers after removing leading and trailing zeros. **
