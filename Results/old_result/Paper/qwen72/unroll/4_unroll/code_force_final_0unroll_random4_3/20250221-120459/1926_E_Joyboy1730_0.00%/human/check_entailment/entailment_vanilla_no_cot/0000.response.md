Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Populating `L`**:
   - The program attempts to populate the list `L` with the number of cards that can be laid down at each step, but it does not actually store any values in `L`. The while loop only updates `n` and `m` but does not append `m` to `L`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `tot` and `k`**:
   - The program incorrectly updates `k` by subtracting `tot` from it, which is not the correct way to keep track of the position of the card being laid down. The variable `tot` should be used to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far, and `k` should be adjusted accordingly.

3. **Incorrect Break Condition**:
   - The break condition inside the for loop is incorrect. It should check if the current total number of cards laid down plus the number of cards in the current step is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Incorrect Final Calculation**:
   - The final calculation to determine the k-th card is incorrect. It should correctly identify the card based on the position within the current step.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        step = 1
        while True:
            m = (n + step - 1) // step
            if m % 2 == 1:
                m = (m + 1) // 2
            else:
                m = m // 2
            if k <= m:
                print(step * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            k -= m
            step += 1
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- **Step Calculation**: The variable `step` is used to keep track of the current step in the process.
- **Number of Cards in Current Step**: `m` is calculated as the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step. If `step` is odd, `m` is the number of odd-numbered cards. If `step` is even, `m` is the number of cards that are `step` times an odd number.
- **Check if k-th Card is in Current Step**: If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the k-th card is found and printed. The card is calculated as `step * (2 * k - 1)`.
- **Adjust k and Move to Next Step**: If the k-th card is not in the current step, `k` is adjusted by subtracting `m`, and the step is incremented to move to the next step.

This corrected program should correctly determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.
