Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to create a string with exactly `n` special characters. This is because each special character must be part of a pair (either "AA" or "BB" or "AB" or "BA"), and an odd number of such pairs cannot be formed. Therefore, the function prints "NO" for odd `n`, which is correct.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function constructs a pattern of alternating "AB" or "BA" pairs. Specifically, it appends "A" followed by "B" or "B" followed by "A" depending on the index `i` modulo 2. This ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, making all characters in the pattern special.

4. **Pattern Construction**: The pattern is constructed by appending characters to a list and then joining the list into a string. This approach is efficient and correct.

5. **Output**: The function prints "YES" followed by the constructed pattern string for even `n`, which meets the problem's requirements.

6. **Length Constraint**: The constructed string has a length of `n` for even `n`, which is always less than or equal to 200 (since `n` is at most 50 and the string length is `n`).

Given the above points, the program correctly handles all specified cases and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
