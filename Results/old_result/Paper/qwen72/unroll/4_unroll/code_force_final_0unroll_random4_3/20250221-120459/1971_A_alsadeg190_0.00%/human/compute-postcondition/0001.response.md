The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`. For the loop to execute, `x` must be at least 1. The state of `y` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0.

State: **`x` must be an integer such that 1 <= x <= 9, `i` is 0**
