The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Since `t` is already within a range that ensures it is greater than 0, no adjustment is needed.

State: **t is an integer input by the user, 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
