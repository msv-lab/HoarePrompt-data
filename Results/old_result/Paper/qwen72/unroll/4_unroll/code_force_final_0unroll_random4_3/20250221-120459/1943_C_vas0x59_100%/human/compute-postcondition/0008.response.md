Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, representing the adjacency list of an undirected tree. `d` is the list of shortest distances from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree. `previous` is the list of previous vertices in the shortest path from vertex `a` to all other vertices in the tree. `a` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. `b` is the value returned by `func_1(d)`. `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**
