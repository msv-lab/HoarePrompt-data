The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `d` and `e` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It reads the number of test cases `a` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `d`, and `e`. The function then searches for the position in `d` where the next character of `d` is no longer found in the remaining part of `e` starting from the current position. It outputs an integer `k` for each test case, which represents the position in `d` where the search stops. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the binary strings `d` and `e` are not modified by the function.
