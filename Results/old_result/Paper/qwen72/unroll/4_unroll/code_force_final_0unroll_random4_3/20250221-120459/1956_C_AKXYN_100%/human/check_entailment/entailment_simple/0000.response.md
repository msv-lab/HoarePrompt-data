Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer \( n \) representing the size of an \( n \times n \) matrix. The goal is to maximize the sum of all numbers in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either set a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and initializes a matrix `mat` with each row being a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Calculation of the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum sum `res` using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \).
   - This formula is derived from the fact that the maximum sum is achieved when each row and each column is filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). The sum of the elements in the matrix is \( n \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} i \), which simplifies to \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). However, the program uses a different formula, which is incorrect.

3. **Output of the Operations:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum `res` and the number of operations \( 2n \) (which is `n << 1`).
   - It then prints \( 2n \) operations, alternating between type 1 and type 2 operations, starting from the last row and column and moving to the first.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of the Maximum Sum:**
  - The formula used to calculate `res` is \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \), which is not the correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix.
  - The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) multiplied by \( n \).

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for performing the operations is correct, as it ensures that each row and column is filled with a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), which is the optimal way to maximize the sum.
- However, the calculation of the maximum sum `res` is incorrect, leading to the wrong output for the sum.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **incorrect** because it uses the wrong formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.

Correctness: **False**
