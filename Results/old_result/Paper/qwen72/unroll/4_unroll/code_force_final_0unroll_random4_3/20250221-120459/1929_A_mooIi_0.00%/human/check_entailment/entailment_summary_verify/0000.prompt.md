You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, sorts the list in non-decreasing order, and prints the sorted list as a space-separated string. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and the input lists remain unchanged, but the sorted lists have been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted elements. This does not meet the requirement of calculating the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 1 3
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1 2 3
  ```

The program should compute the maximum beauty, which in this case is 2, but it instead prints the sorted array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
