#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings (strings consisting of the characters '0' and '1'), and i and j are non-negative integers such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b).
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. If the character `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, it returns `-1`. The function does not modify the input parameters.
