### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input from `sys.stdin`, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.
   - This is a standard way to read input in Python, and it works correctly for the given problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function calls `func_1` and converts the returned string to an integer.
   - The integer returned by `func_2` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - This is also a standard and correct way to handle the input for the number of test cases.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
   - It is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.
   - This function works correctly for the given problem.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is '?', and only the specified direction if `c` is '0' or '1'.
   - The set `ans` is updated by adding `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to a temporary set `temp`, and then `ans` is set to `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, it checks if `0` is in the set `ans` and, if so, removes `0` and adds `n` to the set.
   - Finally, it prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

### Analysis of Function 4:
- **Initialization**: The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.
- **Processing Throws**: The function correctly handles the three possible cases for the direction `c`:
  - If `c` is '0', it adds the result of `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
  - If `c` is '1', it adds the result of `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
  - If `c` is '?', it adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
- **Handling 0**: The function correctly handles the case where `0` is in the set `ans` by removing `0` and adding `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` is not a valid player number.
- **Output**: The function prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players, which is the correct output format for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reads the input, processes the throws, and outputs the correct results for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
