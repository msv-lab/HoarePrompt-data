Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum possible number `k` such that a prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. The function reads the lengths of the strings `n` and `m`, followed by the strings `a` and `b` themselves. It then iterates through each character of string `a` and tries to find a matching character in string `b` starting from the current position `j` in `b`. If a match is found, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next position in `b`. If no match is found, the loop breaks, and the function prints `k`.

However, the function as provided does not handle multiple test cases, which is a requirement according to the problem description. The function should be called `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is a critical part of the problem that the given function does not address.

Therefore, the function is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirement to handle multiple test cases.

Correctness: **False**
