Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).** 

However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func(n, k):
```

With the precondition:

**n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2).**
