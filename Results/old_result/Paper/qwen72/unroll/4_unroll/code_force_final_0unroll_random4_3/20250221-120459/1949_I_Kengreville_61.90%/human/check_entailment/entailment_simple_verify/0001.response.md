### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` to store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - It also initializes the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists to keep track of visited disks and coefficients for the radii changes.
   - The `nodes` list is used to store the indices of the disks in the current connected component.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the connected component of disks that are tangent to each other.
   - It marks the current disk `i` as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list.
   - For each disk `j` that is not visited and is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` for disk `j` and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.
   - The tangency condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` is correctly implemented to avoid computing the square root, which is efficient.

3. **Main Function:**
   - The main function `func_1` iterates over all disks and performs a DFS on each unvisited disk to explore its connected component.
   - It calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the disks in the current connected component.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is non-zero for any connected component, it sets `ok` to `True`, indicating that it is possible to change the radii in the desired manner.
   - Finally, it prints `YES` if `ok` is `True` and `NO` otherwise.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Tangency Condition:**
  - The program correctly checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the square of the sum of their radii to the square of the distance between their centers. This is a valid and efficient way to check tangency without computing the square root.

- **Connected Components:**
  - The program uses DFS to explore connected components of tangent disks. This is a correct approach because it ensures that all disks that are tangent to each other are grouped together.

- **Coefficient Calculation:**
  - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to determine if it is possible to change the radii such that the sum of the radii decreases while maintaining tangency.
  - The calculation of `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]` is based on the idea that if two disks are tangent, their radii changes should be inversely related to maintain tangency.
  - This ensures that if one disk's radius is increased, the other's radius must be decreased by the same amount to keep the tangency.

- **Sum of Coefficients:**
  - The program checks if the sum of `coef1` for any connected component is non-zero. If `c1 != 0`, it means that there is a way to change the radii of the disks in that component such that the sum of the radii decreases.
  - This is because a non-zero sum of `coef1` implies that there is a non-trivial linear combination of the radii changes that can result in a decrease in the total sum of radii.

### Potential Issues:

- **Initialization of `coef0` and `coef1`:**
  - The initial values of `coef0[i]` and `coef1[i]` are set to `0` and `1` respectively. This is correct because it starts the calculation with a base value.
  - However, the program assumes that the initial values of `coef0` and `coef1` for the first disk in each component are `0` and `1`. This is fine because the relative changes are what matter, and the initial values are arbitrary.

- **DFS and `nodes` List:**
  - The `nodes` list is reset to an empty list for each new connected component, which is correct.
  - The `dfs` function correctly updates the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists and appends the indices of the disks in the current component to `nodes`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks in the desired manner. It uses DFS to find connected components of tangent disks and calculates the necessary coefficients to check if the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

Therefore, the program is correct.
