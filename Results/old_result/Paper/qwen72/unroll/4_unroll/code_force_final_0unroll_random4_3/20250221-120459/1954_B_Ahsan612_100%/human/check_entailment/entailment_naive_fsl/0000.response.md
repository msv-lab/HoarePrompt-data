Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is beautiful and we need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful. Specifically, the logic for updating `minn` and `same` is flawed. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

The program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove. The issue lies in the way the `same` and `minn` variables are updated. The program should correctly identify that removing any one of the middle elements (index 1, 2, or 3) will make the array non-beautiful, but it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove as 2.
