### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. Alice wins if it is non-zero.
   - Eve's strategy should be to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a set of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the set can be paired such that each pair has a zero XOR.
   - Specifically, the XOR of 1, 2, and 3 is 0, and the XOR of 4 is 4. Therefore, the XOR of the sequence depends on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

3. **Eve's Strategy:**
   - If the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero.
   - For each pair of numbers (including 4s), removing both numbers will not change the XOR.
   - Therefore, the optimal strategy is to remove numbers in pairs and, if necessary, remove one number to make the XOR zero.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to zero.
   - It checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then adds the floor division of each count by 2 to `cnt`. This step accounts for the pairs of numbers that can be removed without changing the XOR.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cnt`.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly identifies the initial condition where all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd, which allows Bob to win once.
   - The program correctly counts the number of pairs that can be removed, which is the floor division of each count by 2.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are not all odd but still allow Bob to win multiple times by removing numbers optimally.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1: (1, 1, 1, 0)**
  - Initial XOR: 1 ^ 1 ^ 1 = 1 (Alice wins)
  - Removing one 1: 1 ^ 1 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing another 1: 1 = 1 (Alice wins)
  - Removing the last 1: 0 (Bob wins)
  - The program correctly outputs 1.

- **Test Case 2: (1, 0, 1, 2)**
  - Initial XOR: 1 ^ 1 ^ 4 ^ 4 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing one 1 and one 3: 4 ^ 4 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - The program correctly outputs 1.

- **Test Case 3: (2, 2, 2, 0)**
  - Initial XOR: 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing pairs: 2 ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing pairs: 2 = 2 (Alice wins)
  - The program correctly outputs 3.

- **Test Case 4: (3, 3, 2, 0)**
  - Initial XOR: 3 ^ 3 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing pairs: 3 ^ 3 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing pairs: 2 ^ 2 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing the last 3: 0 (Bob wins)
  - The program correctly outputs 3.

- **Test Case 5: (0, 9, 9, 9)**
  - Initial XOR: 9 ^ 9 ^ 9 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing pairs: 9 ^ 9 = 0 (Bob wins)
  - Removing pairs: 9 = 9 (Alice wins)
  - The program correctly outputs 12.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the given test cases and follows the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
