You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, not as parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers, followed by a line containing n integers a_1, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        dic = dict()
        
        ans = 0
        
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if i in dic:
                dic[i] -= 1
                if dic[i] == 0:
                    del dic[i]
            else:
                if s not in dic:
                    dic[s] = 0
                dic[s] += 1
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `times` is 0, `check` is 2147483647.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The function processes these integers and prints the number of unique integers that, when XORed with `2^31 - 1`, either do not exist in the input or appear an odd number of times. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `times` is 0 and `check` is `2147483647`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the grouping of numbers. The program uses a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the numbers and their complements (i.e., `i ^ check`). However, the way it updates the dictionary and increments the `ans` variable is incorrect.

### Issue:
1. **Incorrect Dictionary Update**:
   - The program checks if `i` is already in the dictionary. If it is, it decrements the count and deletes the entry if the count reaches zero.
   - If `i` is not in the dictionary, it checks if `i ^ check` is in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of `i ^ check` and increments `ans`.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the condition that no two numbers in the same group can have the same bit values in the 31 least significant bits.

### Example Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The binary representations of these numbers are:
  - 1: `00000000000000000000000000000001`
  - 2: `00000000000000000000000000000010`
  - 3: `00000000000000000000000000000011`

- According to the problem, these numbers can be grouped as follows:
  - Group 1: [1, 2]
  - Group 2: [3]

- However, the provided program will output `3` because it incorrectly handles the grouping logic.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach to solve this problem is to use a bitmask to represent the 31 least significant bits of each number. Each unique bitmask should be placed in a separate group. The minimum number of groups required is the number of unique bitmasks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    times = int(input())
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        bitmasks = set()
        for i in data:
            bitmask = i & (2 ** 31 - 1)
            bitmasks.add(bitmask)
        print(len(bitmasks))
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the unique bitmasks and prints the minimum number of groups required.
