### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make up to \(3n\) queries to compare bitwise OR results.
   - The queries are of the form `? a b c d`, and the response is either `<`, `>`, or `=`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \(n\).
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\). For each \(i\), it queries `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`. If the response is `<`, it updates `ans1` to \(i\). This step is intended to find the index \(i\) such that \(p_i\) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It then initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to a list containing 0. It iterates over the range from 1 to \(n-1\) again, querying `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`. If the response is `<`, it updates `mx` to \(i\) and resets `v` to a list containing \(i\). If the response is `=`, it appends \(i\) to `v`. This step is intended to find indices \(i\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_{ans1}\) is maximized.
   - Finally, it iterates over the list `v` to find the index `ans` such that \(p_{ans} \oplus p_{ans1}\) is maximized.
   - It prints the result in the format `! ans ans1`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The first loop correctly identifies the index `ans1` such that \(p_{ans1}\) is the maximum value in the permutation. This is because the bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself, and if \(p_i\) is greater than \(p_{ans1}\), the response will be `<`.
   - The second loop correctly identifies indices \(i\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_{ans1}\) is maximized. This is because the bitwise OR of \(p_i\) and \(p_{ans1}\) will be compared to the bitwise OR of \(p_{mx}\) and \(p_{ans1}\). If \(p_i \oplus p_{ans1}\) is greater, the response will be `<`, and `mx` will be updated to \(i\).
   - The final loop ensures that among the indices in `v`, the one with the maximum \(p_i \oplus p_{ans1}\) is selected.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The final loop makes at most \(|v|-1\) queries, where \(|v|\) is the number of indices in `v`. Since `v` can contain at most \(n\) elements, the final loop makes at most \(n-1\) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \(2(n-1) + (|v|-1) \le 3n-3\), which is within the allowed limit of \(3n\) queries.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the algorithm to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized, and it adheres to the query limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
