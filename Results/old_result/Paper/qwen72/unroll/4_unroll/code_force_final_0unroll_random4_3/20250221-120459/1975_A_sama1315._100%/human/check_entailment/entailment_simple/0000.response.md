### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` as input.
   - It first calculates the length of `a` and sorts `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a concatenated version of `a` by repeating `a` twice (`concatenated_a = a + a`).
   - The function then iterates over the range of the length of `a` and checks if any segment of `concatenated_a` of length `n` matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a segment is found, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If no such segment is found after the loop, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`**:
  - The logic of `func_1` is correct. By concatenating `a` with itself, it effectively checks all possible cyclic permutations of `a`.
  - If any cyclic permutation of `a` matches the sorted version of `a`, then `a` can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.
  - The function correctly returns 'Yes' if such a permutation is found and 'No' otherwise.

- **Correctness of `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and handles multiple test cases.
  - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`, and calls `func_1` to determine if `a` can be made non-decreasing.
  - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation.
- The input and output handling in `func_2` is also correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
