Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations. The operations involve setting either a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - To maximize the sum, each element in the matrix should be set to a value between 1 and \( n \). The optimal way to do this is to use the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column operation.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Sum**:
   - The correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix is:
     \[
     \text{Max Sum} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - This is because each row and each column will contain the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \), and there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row, which is not necessary since the matrix is initially filled with zeroes and will be overwritten by the operations.
   - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula:
     \[
     \text{res} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{res} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
     \]
   - However, the program prints the correct number of operations and the correct operations themselves, which will fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations, ensuring that each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \).
   - The operations are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's calculation of the maximum sum is incorrect, but the operations it performs are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.
   - The number of operations is within the allowed limit of \( 2n \).

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is partially correct in identifying that the operations are correct and will achieve the maximum sum. However, the assessment is incorrect in stating that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is correct. Despite this, the program still outputs the correct operations and the correct number of operations, which is sufficient to solve the problem as required.

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum, even though the operations it performs are correct and will achieve the maximum sum. The correct formula should be used to ensure the program is fully correct.
