You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        temp = -1
        ans = []
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        print(sum(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It computes the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of the sorted list `a` and elements of the reversed sorted list `b`. The function prints the sum for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are not modified by the function, and the final state of the program is the printed sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it selects elements from the `b` array. Specifically, the line `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` is incorrect. The `[:m]` slice is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results because `b` should contain all `m` integers, not just the first `m` integers after sorting.

Additionally, the logic for choosing the elements from the `b` array to maximize the difference is flawed. The program attempts to choose the largest possible differences by comparing `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)])` and `abs(a[i] - b[i])`, but this approach does not always guarantee the maximum total difference.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 6
6 1 2 4
3 5 1 7 2 3
```
The expected output is `16`, as Vasya can create the array `(1, 5, 7, 2)` to maximize the difference.

However, the program will output a different result. Here's why:
- `a` is sorted to `[1, 2, 4, 6]`.
- `b` is sorted in reverse to `[7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]`.

The program will then:
- Compare `abs(1 - 1)` and `abs(1 - 7)`, and choose `abs(1 - 7) = 6`.
- Compare `abs(2 - 2)` and `abs(2 - 5)`, and choose `abs(2 - 5) = 3`.
- Compare `abs(4 - 3)` and `abs(4 - 3)`, and choose `abs(4 - 3) = 1`.
- Compare `abs(6 - 3)` and `abs(6 - 1)`, and choose `abs(6 - 1) = 5`.

The total difference is `6 + 3 + 1 + 5 = 15`, which is less than the expected `16`.

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct maximum difference.
