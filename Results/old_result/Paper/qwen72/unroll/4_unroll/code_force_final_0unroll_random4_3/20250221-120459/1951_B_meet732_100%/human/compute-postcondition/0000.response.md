Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 10^5, and each a_i is a distinct integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`.** 

Explanation: The variable `x` is assigned the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the properties of `a` (i.e., its length and the distinctness and range of its elements) are still valid.
