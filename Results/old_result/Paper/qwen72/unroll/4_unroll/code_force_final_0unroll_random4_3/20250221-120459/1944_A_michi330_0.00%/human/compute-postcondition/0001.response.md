The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are parameters of the function, and `t` is an input integer. To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are the parameters of the function, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
