Output State: **The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. The function should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and there is exactly one square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area for each test case. `n` is 0. The code has printed the value of `s` for each test case, where `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` for each input `l`.**
