The variables in the loop head are `p` and `num`. For the loop to execute, the condition `p <= num` must be true. Given the state before the loop, `p` is 2 and `num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2. Since `p` is already 2, and `num` is at least 2, the condition `p <= num` is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer such that `num` >= 2; `prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where the first two elements are `False` and the rest are `True`; `Highest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of `num + 1` elements, where each element is `0`; `p` is 2**
