Functionality: ** The function `func` operates in an environment with a secret permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. It processes `kp` test cases, each with a different value of `n`. For each test case, the function makes at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. It then outputs a pair of indices `(prev, v1)` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[prev]` and `p[v1]` is maximized, with 0 ≤ prev, v1 < n. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain any state from previous iterations. **
