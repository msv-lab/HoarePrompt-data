### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.

2. **Score Initialization:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program iterates `k` times to simulate the game turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the current score and the potential score from the next position.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated accordingly.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the final scores `bm` and `sm` are compared.
   - The program prints "Bodya" if `bm` is greater, "Sasha" if `sm` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Score Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for updating the scores `bm` and `sm` is incorrect. The program uses `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which does not correctly simulate the game's rules.
   - The correct approach should be to simply add the score from the current position to the total score and then move to the next position based on the permutation.

2. **Position Update:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Score Update:**
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` should be updated by adding the value at the current position in `a` to the total score.
   - The maximum score calculation is unnecessary and incorrect.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to 0.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each turn, the score of Bodya and Sasha is increased by the value at their current position in `a`.
   - The positions are then updated based on the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After `k` turns, the final scores are compared, and the result is printed accordingly.

### Correctness:
- The original program contains logical errors in the score calculation.
- The corrected program accurately follows the game rules and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
