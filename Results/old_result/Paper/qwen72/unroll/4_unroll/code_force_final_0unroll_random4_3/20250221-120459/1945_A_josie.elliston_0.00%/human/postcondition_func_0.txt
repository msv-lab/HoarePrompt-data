The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers, `extroverts` and `universals`, where both are between 0 and 10^9 inclusive. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is less than 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3.
