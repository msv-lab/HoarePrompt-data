Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` (the number of elements, the number of elements Alice can remove, and the number of elements Bob can multiply by -1).
   - It reads the list of elements `a` and sorts it.
   - It then calls `func_2` with the sorted list and the values of `k` and `x`.
   - The result from `func_2` is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` as parameters.
   - It has a special case where if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, it returns 0. This special case is not well-justified and seems to be an ad-hoc solution for a specific test case, which is not a good practice.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements and `n` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), updating `s` and `n` by removing the largest elements and adding the smallest elements to the list of possible sums `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob should multiply the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement this strategy. Instead, it seems to be removing the largest elements and adding the smallest elements, which is not optimal for Alice's goal of maximizing the sum.

4. **Special Case**:
   - The special case in `func_2` where it returns 0 if `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3 is not a general solution and does not align with the problem's requirements.

5. **General Behavior**:
   - The function `func_2` should be designed to handle all cases optimally, not just specific ones.
   - The logic in `func_2` for updating `s` and `n` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, and the special case handling is not justified. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
