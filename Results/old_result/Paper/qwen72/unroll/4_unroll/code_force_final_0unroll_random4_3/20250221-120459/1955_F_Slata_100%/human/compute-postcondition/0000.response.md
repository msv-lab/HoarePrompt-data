The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value provided by `int(input())`. If this value is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` and `p_i` do not directly affect the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
