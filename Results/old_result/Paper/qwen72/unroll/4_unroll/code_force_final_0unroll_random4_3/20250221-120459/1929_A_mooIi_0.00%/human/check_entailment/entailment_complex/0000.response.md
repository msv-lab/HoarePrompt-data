Reasoning:  
The given problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, the array should be sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized when the array is sorted.

However, the provided program does not actually compute the maximum beauty. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a space-separated string. This does not match the required output, which should be a single integer representing the maximum beauty.

Additionally, the program uses `map(str, ...)` to convert the sorted integers to strings before printing, which is unnecessary for the problem's requirements.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
