Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required is more than 3. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

In this case, the correct output should be 4 because the friends form a cycle of length 6, and to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to 4 friends. However, the given program will output 3, which is incorrect.
