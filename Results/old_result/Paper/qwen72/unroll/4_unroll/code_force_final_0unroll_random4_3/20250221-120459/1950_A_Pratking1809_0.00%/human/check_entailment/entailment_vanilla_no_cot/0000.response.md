Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where neither a stair nor a peak is formed correctly. Specifically, the `else` block is not properly placed to ensure that "NONE" is only printed when neither of the conditions for a stair or a peak is met. The current structure of the program will print "NONE" even if one of the conditions for a stair or a peak is true, because the `else` block is directly under the second `if` statement.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version ensures that "NONE" is printed only when neither the stair nor the peak condition is satisfied.
