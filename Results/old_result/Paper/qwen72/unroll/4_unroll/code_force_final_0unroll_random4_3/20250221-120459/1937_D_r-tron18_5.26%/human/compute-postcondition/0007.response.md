To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and understand the variables and objects involved:

1. **`s1`**: This is a string that remains unchanged. The exact content of `s1` is not provided, but it is assumed to contain characters, possibly including '<'.

2. **`totalOne`**: This is an integer initialized to 0. It is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for now.

3. **`preOne`**: This is an empty list. It is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for now.

4. **`suffZero`**: This is a list that contains the cumulative sums of the indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, plus an initial 0. For example, if `s1` is "a<b<c", the indices of '<' characters are 1 and 3. The cumulative sums would be [0, 1, 4].

5. **`ans`**: This is a list that contains calculated values for each index in `s1`. The exact formula or method for calculating these values is not provided, but we can infer that `ans` is derived from the information in `s1` and `suffZero`.

Given the `print(*ans)` statement, it will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. Since the exact values in `ans` are not provided, we need to describe the values based on the given information.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:
1. **`s1`**: The string `s1` remains unchanged. The exact content is not specified, but it is assumed to contain characters, possibly including '<'.
2. **`suffZero`**: This list contains the cumulative sums of the indices of all '<' characters in `s1`, plus an initial 0. For example, if `s1` is "a<b<c", `suffZero` would be [0, 1, 4].
3. **`ans`**: This list contains calculated values for each index in `s1`. The exact formula for these values is not provided, but we can infer that each value in `ans` is derived from the information in `s1` and `suffZero`.

Since the exact formula for `ans` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the calculated values for each index in `s1`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces. The exact values in `ans` depend on the content of `s1` and the cumulative sums in `suffZero`.

Output: **[ans[0], ans[1], ..., ans[len(s1) - 1]] (where each ans[i] is the calculated value for the i-th index in the string s1)**

This format indicates that the output will be a sequence of values, each corresponding to an index in the string `s1`, and these values are calculated based on the content of `s1` and the cumulative sums in `suffZero`.
