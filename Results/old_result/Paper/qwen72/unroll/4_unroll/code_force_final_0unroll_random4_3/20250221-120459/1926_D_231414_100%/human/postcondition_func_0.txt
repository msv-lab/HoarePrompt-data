The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The function processes these integers and prints the number of unique integers that, when XORed with `2^31 - 1`, either do not exist in the input or appear an odd number of times. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that `times` is 0 and `check` is `2147483647`.
