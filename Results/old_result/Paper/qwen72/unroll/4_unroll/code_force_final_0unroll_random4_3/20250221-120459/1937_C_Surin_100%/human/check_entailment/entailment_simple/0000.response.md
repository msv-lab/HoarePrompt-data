### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Finding the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - The function initializes `v1` to 0 and then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each `i` in this range, it queries the comparison between `p_v1 | p_v1` and `p_i | p_i`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `i`. This step ensures that `v1` is the index of the element with the maximum value in the permutation.

3. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The function initializes `prev` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` again.
   - For each `i` in this range, it queries the comparison between `p_v1 | p_i` and `p_v1 | p_prev`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it performs an additional query to compare `p_i | p_i` with `p_prev | p_prev` and updates `prev` to `i` if `p_i` is smaller.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, the function prints the pair of indices `(prev, v1)` such that `p_prev ⊕ p_v1` is maximized.
   - The function flushes the output after each query and the final answer.

### Analysis:
- **Query Efficiency:**
  - The first loop makes `n-1` queries to find the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop makes up to `2(n-1)` queries to find the index `prev` that maximizes the XOR with `v1`.
  - The total number of queries is at most `3n - 3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Correctness of XOR Maximization:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index `v1` of the maximum value in the permutation.
  - The second loop correctly identifies the index `prev` such that `p_prev ⊕ p_v1` is maximized by comparing the bitwise OR results and performing additional checks when necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It efficiently uses the allowed number of queries to find the pair of indices that maximizes the XOR operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
