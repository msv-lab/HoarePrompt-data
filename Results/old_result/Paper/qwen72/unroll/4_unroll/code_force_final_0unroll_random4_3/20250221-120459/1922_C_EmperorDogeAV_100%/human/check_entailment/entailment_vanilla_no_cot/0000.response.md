Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Closest City Determination:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly calculates the distance to the closest city. It should only return the index of the closest city, not the distance itself.
   - The function `func_1` is also not correctly handling the edge cases for the first and last cities. The first city should only consider the next city as the closest, and the last city should only consider the previous city as the closest.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are being calculated using the incorrect values from `func_1`. They should be calculated based on the actual distances to the closest cities, not the distances themselves.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The program is not correctly handling the queries. It should use the closest city information to minimize the cost of travel, but instead, it is subtracting prefix sums, which does not account for the 1-coin cost of moving to the closest city.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city.
2. Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to calculate the minimum cost to travel from any city to any other city.
3. For each query, use the precomputed closest city information to calculate the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Determine the closest city for each city
    closest_cities = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]):
            closest_cities[i] = i + 1
        else:
            closest_cities[i] = i - 1
    closest_cities[0] = 1
    closest_cities[n - 1] = n - 2
    
    # Precompute the minimum cost to travel from any city to any other city
    forward_costs = [0] * n
    backward_costs = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        forward_costs[i] = min(forward_costs[i - 1] + abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]), 1 + forward_costs[closest_cities[i]])
    
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        backward_costs[i] = min(backward_costs[i + 1] + abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]), 1 + backward_costs[closest_cities[i]])
    
    m = int(input())
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b:
            print(forward_costs[b - 1] - forward_costs[a - 1])
        else:
            print(backward_costs[b - 1] - backward_costs[a - 1])
```

This corrected version:
- Determines the closest city for each city correctly.
- Precomputes the minimum cost to travel from any city to any other city using dynamic programming.
- Handles each query by using the precomputed costs to determine the minimum number of coins required.
