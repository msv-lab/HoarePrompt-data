Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If `a >= b`, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is more profitable than using the modified price. In this case, the program correctly prints `n * a`.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation**: If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` and that the modified price sequence is used up to the point where it is no longer beneficial (i.e., the price of the last modified bun is at least `a`).

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`. This formula correctly sums the prices from `b` to `b - k + 1`.
   - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a` is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then printed as the sum of the two parts: `ans + p2`.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the maximum profit for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `a >= b`, the program correctly sells all buns at the usual price.
   - When `a < b`, the program correctly calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit.

Given the problem description and the execution states, the program appears to handle all cases correctly and efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
