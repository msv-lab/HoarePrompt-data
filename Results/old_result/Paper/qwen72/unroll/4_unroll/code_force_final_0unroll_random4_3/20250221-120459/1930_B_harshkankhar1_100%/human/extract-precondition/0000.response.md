It seems there's a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description involves a function that generates a permutation of a given length `n`, but the function definition does not include any parameters. I will provide the correct precondition based on the problem description, assuming the function should take `n` as a parameter.

Function definition:
```
def func_1(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^5.**
