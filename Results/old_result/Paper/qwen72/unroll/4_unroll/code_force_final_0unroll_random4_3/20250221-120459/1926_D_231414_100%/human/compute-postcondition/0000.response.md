The code snippet `times = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `times`. This integer represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained by the precondition to be between 1 and 10^4.

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, not as parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `times` is assigned the value of `t`.**
