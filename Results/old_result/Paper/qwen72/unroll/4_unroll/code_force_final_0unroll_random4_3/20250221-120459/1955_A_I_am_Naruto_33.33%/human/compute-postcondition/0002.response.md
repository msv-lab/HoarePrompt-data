The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves integers `n`, `a`, and `b` with specific ranges. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given output information.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, indicating the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function is likely to return a result for each test case, but without further details on the output, we can only infer that it processes these inputs and returns some form of output based on them.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges, and returns a result for each test case.**
