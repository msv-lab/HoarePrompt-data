#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer key `da` from `d`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it updates the `rank` list at the index `da - 1` with the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` for the elements in `d[da]` where the corresponding element in `processing` was initially 0, plus 1. The function ultimately returns this minimum value plus 1. The dictionary `d` and the list `processing` remain unchanged after the function call.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it computes the values recursively and returns `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a non-negative integer `n` (where 0 <= n <= len(a)), a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `a`, and for each element that is less than `m`, it decrements `k` by the difference `m - a[i]`. After the loop, if `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. If `k` is negative, the function returns -1. The list `a`, integer `n`, and positive integer `m` remain unchanged. The final state of `k` is an integer that has been decremented by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in range(n) where a[i] < m.
