Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 1000, `pos` is an empty list.** 

The initial state conditions for `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged. The variable `pos` is now an empty list.
