The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally handle or generate test cases involving an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000) and two integers `x` and `y` for each test case (where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9). The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on these parameters.

Since the function's output is not provided, I will describe the expected functionality based on the parameters:

Functionality: **The function internally handles or generates `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it processes two integers `x` and `y`, both of which are between 1 and 10^100 and consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function returns a result based on these test cases.**
