The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by the integer `t` and the list `a` of size `n` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i < n.
