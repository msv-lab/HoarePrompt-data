### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves \( n \) piles of stones.
   - On each turn, a player can choose a positive integer \( k \) that is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile and remove \( k \) stones from each nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice can always win by choosing \( k \) such that the smallest pile size is reduced to zero on her turn, leaving Bob with an even number of distinct pile sizes.
   - If the number of distinct pile sizes is even, Bob can always win by mirroring Alice's moves, ensuring that the number of distinct pile sizes remains even until Alice is forced to make the last move.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles \( n \) and the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It then creates a set of the pile sizes to get the distinct pile sizes.
   - The set is converted to a list and sorted.
   - A zero is prepended to the list to handle edge cases.
   - The program checks if the number of distinct pile sizes is 2 (i.e., all piles have the same size). If so, Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, it iterates through the sorted list of distinct pile sizes and checks if there is a gap greater than 1 between consecutive sizes. If such a gap is found, it breaks the loop.
   - The variable `ans` is used to track the parity of the number of distinct pile sizes. It is initialized to 1 (odd).
   - The loop toggles `ans` with each iteration, effectively counting the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - Finally, it prints "Alice" if `ans` is 1 (odd) and "Bob" if `ans` is 0 (even).

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of distinct pile sizes.
   - It correctly handles the case where all piles have the same size (i.e., the set has only one distinct size, and the list has two elements after prepending zero).
   - The loop and the parity check are correctly implemented to determine the winner based on the number of distinct pile sizes.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
