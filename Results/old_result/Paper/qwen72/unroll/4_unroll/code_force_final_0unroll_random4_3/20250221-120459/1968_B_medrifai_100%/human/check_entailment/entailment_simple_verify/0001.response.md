### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and then the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `i`, `j`, and `c` are initialized to 0.
     - `i` is the index for string `a`.
     - `j` is the index for string `b`.
     - `c` is the count of the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The while loop iterates as long as `j` is less than `m` and `i` is less than `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1` to find the index in `b` where the character `a[i]` is found starting from index `j`.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (to move to the next character in `b`), increments `i` (to move to the next character in `a`), and increments `c` (to count the matched character).
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it breaks the loop because it means that the current character in `a` cannot be found in the remaining part of `b`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`.
   - It uses the `find` method to search for the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character in the substring `b[j:]` plus `j` (to get the actual index in `b`).
   - If the character is not found, it returns -1.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Validation with Annotated Code:
- The annotated code confirms that `a` and `b` are binary strings and `i` and `j` are non-negative integers within the bounds of their respective strings.
- The function `func_1` correctly uses the `find` method to locate the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` and returns the appropriate index or -1.
- The main loop correctly updates the indices and the count `c` based on the results of `func_1`.

### Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - `a = "10011"`, `b = "1110"`
  - `i` and `j` start at 0.
  - `a[0] = '1'` is found at `b[0]`, so `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `c = 1`.
  - `a[1] = '0'` is found at `b[3]`, so `i = 2`, `j = 4`, `c = 2`.
  - `a[2] = '0'` is not found in `b[4:]`, so the loop breaks.
  - Output: `2` (correct).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "110"`
  - `i` and `j` start at 0.
  - `a[0] = '1'` is found at `b[0]`, so `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `c = 1`.
  - `a[1] = '0'` is found at `b[2]`, so `i = 2`, `j = 3`, `c = 2`.
  - `a[2] = '0'` is not found in `b[3:]`, so the loop breaks.
  - Output: `2` (correct).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `a = "1"`, `b = "111"`
  - `i` and `j` start at 0.
  - `a[0] = '1'` is found at `b[0]`, so `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `c = 1`.
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `a = "1011"`, `b = "1111"`
  - `i` and `j` start at 0.
  - `a[0] = '1'` is found at `b[0]`, so `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `c = 1`.
  - `a[1] = '0'` is not found in `b[1:]`, so the loop breaks.
  - Output: `1` (correct).

- **Test Case 5:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "11010"`
  - `i` and `j` start at 0.
  - `a[0] = '1'` is found at `b[0]`, so `i = 1`, `j = 1`, `c = 1`.
  - `a[1] = '0'` is found at `b[2]`, so `i = 2`, `j = 3`, `c = 2`.
  - `a[2] = '0'` is found at `b[4]`, so `i = 3`, `j = 5`, `c = 3`.
  - Output: `3` (correct).

- **Test Case 6:**
  - `a = "100"`, `b = "0"`
  - `i` and `j` start at 0.
  - `a[0] = '1'` is not found in `b[0:]`, so the loop breaks.
  - Output: `0` (correct).
