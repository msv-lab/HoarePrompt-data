The function `func` is expected to accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and the list `a` of size `n`, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_i < n. However, the provided function signature does not define these parameters. Assuming the parameters are correctly defined, the function processes the list `a` based on the size `n` and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list. It processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case, where the number of test cases `t` is between 1 and 2 · 10^4, the size of the list `n` is between 1 and 2 · 10^5, and each element in the list `a` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`.**
