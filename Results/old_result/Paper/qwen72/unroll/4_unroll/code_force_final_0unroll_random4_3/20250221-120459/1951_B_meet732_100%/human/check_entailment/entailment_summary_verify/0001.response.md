### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a list of `n` cows with distinct ratings.
   - The tournament is a series of matches where the winner of each match proceeds to the next.
   - We can swap the position of our cow (index `k`) with another cow once to maximize the number of matches our cow wins.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of wins our cow can achieve.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `l`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list of ratings `l`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `x` is the rating of our cow at index `k`.
   - `ind` is a list that will store the indices of cows with ratings higher than `x`.
   - `c` is a counter to keep track of how many such indices are found.
   - The loop iterates through the list of ratings to find the first two indices where the rating is higher than `x`.
   - Depending on the number of such indices found, the function returns different values:
     - If no indices are found (`ind == []`), our cow is the highest-rated cow and can win all matches except the last one, so it returns `n - 1`.
     - If only one index is found (`len(ind) == 1`):
       - If the index is 0, our cow can win `k - 1` matches.
       - If the index is greater than `k`, our cow can win `ind[0] - 1` matches.
       - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
     - If two indices are found:
       - If the first index is 0, our cow can win the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1` matches.
       - If `k` is greater than the second index, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
       - Otherwise, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the positions of the cows with higher ratings.
   - The conditions and return values are designed to maximize the number of wins for our cow by considering the optimal swap position.
   - The program handles the edge cases where our cow is the highest-rated cow or where there are no cows with higher ratings.
   - The program also correctly handles the cases where there is only one cow with a higher rating and where there are two cows with higher ratings.

5. **Test Case Verification:**
   - For the first test case (`n = 6, k = 1, l = [12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]`):
     - Our cow's rating is 12.
     - The indices of cows with higher ratings are [2].
     - Our cow can win 1 match (against the cow with rating 10).
   - For the second test case (`n = 6, k = 5, l = [7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]`):
     - Our cow's rating is 13.
     - The indices of cows with higher ratings are [2, 5].
     - Our cow can win 2 matches (against the cows with ratings 10 and 12).
   - For the third test case (`n = 2, k = 2, l = [1000000000, 1]`):
     - Our cow's rating is 1.
     - The indices of cows with higher ratings are [0].
     - Our cow can win 0 matches.

### Additional Considerations:
- The function `func_1` is designed to find the optimal number of wins for our cow by considering the positions of the cows with higher ratings.
- The logic for determining the number of wins is based on the relative positions of these higher-rated cows and our cow.
- The function correctly handles the cases where our cow is the highest-rated cow, where there is only one higher-rated cow, and where there are two higher-rated cows.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for our cow, considering the optimal swap position. The test cases provided also match the expected output.

Final: **True**
