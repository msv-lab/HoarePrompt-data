### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` when both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by removing it from `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` or is in `arr` but has been chosen by Alice.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
     - `first` is a boolean flag initialized to `False` to track if Alice has chosen an element that appears exactly once in `arr`.

   - **Iterating through the Range:**
     - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n`.
     - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and the MEX is `i`. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already chosen an element that appears exactly once, and Bob will choose the next one. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will choose this element. The program sets `first` to `True`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements from 0 to `n-1` are in `arr` and each appears at least once, the MEX will be `n`.
   - If `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` and one of them appears exactly once, the program correctly handles this by ensuring Alice and Bob play optimally.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally.
   - The logic for determining the MEX and the optimal play by Alice and Bob is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and will produce the correct MEX for the array `c` when both players play optimally.
