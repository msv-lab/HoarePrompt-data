def func_1():

    #The program returns the first line of input from the user, with any trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads the first line of input from the user via `sys.stdin`, removes any trailing whitespace from this line, and returns the resulting string. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input (with trailing whitespace removed) is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players, 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000; m is an integer representing the number of throws, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000; x is an integer representing the starting player, 1 ≤ x ≤ n; throws is a list of tuples, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a string c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), representing the distance and direction of each throw.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value calculated by the function `func_1()`. The exact value of the integer depends on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided. The function `func_2` itself does not modify any input variables or perform any actions other than calling `func_1()` and returning its result.

Otherwise, `ans` remains a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.

    #This is printed: all possible values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n for each q in the initial set ans and each r and c returned by func_1() during the m iterations, excluding 0 if it was initially in ans, and including n if 0 was initially in ans
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on the integers `n`, `m`, and `x` which are obtained from the function `func_3`. The function computes a set `ans` that contains all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `{x}` and for each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during `m` iterations. If `0` is in the final set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. The function then prints the length of the set `ans` and the elements of the set `ans`. The integers `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
