The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n` and `k` do not affect the loop's execution, and the variable `_` is a throwaway variable that is not used to control the loop's behavior.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
