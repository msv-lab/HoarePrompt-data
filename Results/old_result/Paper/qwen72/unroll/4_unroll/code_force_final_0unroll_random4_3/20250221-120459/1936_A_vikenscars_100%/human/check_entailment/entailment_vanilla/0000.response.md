### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries of the form \( ? a b c d \) to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(a, b, c, d)` sends a query to the interactor and returns the result of the comparison.
   - This function is correct and follows the interaction protocol.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(n)` is the main function that solves the problem.
   - The function first finds the index of the maximum item in the permutation \( p \) by comparing each item with the current maximum item using bitwise OR.
   - It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through the range \( 1 \) to \( n-1 \). For each index \( i \), it compares \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_i \mid p_i \) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \( i \).

4. **Finding the Pair:**
   - After identifying the maximum item, the function initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates through all indices \( i \) from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) to find the best pair.
   - For each index \( i \), it compares \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}} \) with \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i \) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \( i \).
   - If the values are equal, it further compares \( p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}} \) with \( p_i \mid p_i \) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices \( \text{max_item_idx} \) and \( \text{pair_idx} \) as the answer.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop runs \( n-1 \) times, and the second loop runs \( n \) times.
   - Therefore, the total number of queries is \( 2n-1 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem's requirements and constraints. It uses the bitwise OR operation to find the maximum item and then uses further queries to find the pair that maximizes the bitwise XOR operation. The number of queries is within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
