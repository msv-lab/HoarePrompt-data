The function `func` reads multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the elements in `a`, modifies this sum by subtracting twice the value of the top `x` elements, and then further modifies the sum by adding and subtracting elements based on the values of `k` and `x`. The function prints the maximum value between the modified sum and the initial modified sum for each test case. The state of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remains unchanged after each iteration, but the values of the intermediate sums (`ans1` and `ans2`) are recalculated for each test case.
