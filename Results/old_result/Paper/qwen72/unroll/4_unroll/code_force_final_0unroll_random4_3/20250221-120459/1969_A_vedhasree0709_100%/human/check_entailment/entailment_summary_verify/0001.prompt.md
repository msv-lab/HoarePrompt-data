You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` distinct integers, each not equal to its index. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a pair `(i, p)` such that `l[p - 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any values, and the state of the program after each test case is that the variables `t`, `n`, and `l` retain their values, while `i` and `j` are reset for the next test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Monocarp has `n` friends, and each friend has a best friend.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It initializes two variables: `i` (to iterate through the friends) and `j` (a flag to check if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is found).
   - It iterates through the list `l` using a `while` loop.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if the best friend of `l[i]` is `i + 1` (i.e., if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found after the loop, it prints `3`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Pair of Mutual Best Friends**:
     - If there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[i] == p` and `l[p - 1] == i + 1`), then inviting both of them will ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party. This is correctly handled by the program.
   - **No Pair of Mutual Best Friends**:
     - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`. This is because, in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them attend the party. This is a valid approach, but it may not always be the minimum number of invitations needed.
   - **Edge Cases**:
     - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 2` and the friends are each other's best friends.
     - However, it does not handle cases where `n > 2` and there are multiple pairs of mutual best friends or other configurations that might allow for fewer than 3 invitations.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program assumes that if no pair of mutual best friends is found, the minimum number of invitations required is always `3`. This is not always correct. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `l = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. Here, inviting friends `1` and `2` will ensure that friends `1` and `2` attend the party, but the program will print `3`.

### Conclusion:
The program is **not** correct for all possible inputs. It fails to handle cases where the minimum number of invitations required is less than `3` when no pair of mutual best friends is found.

### Correctness:
**False**
