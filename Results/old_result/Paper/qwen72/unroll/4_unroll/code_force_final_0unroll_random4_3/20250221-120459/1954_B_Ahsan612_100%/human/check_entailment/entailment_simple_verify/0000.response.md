### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment to determine if the program is correct or not.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Beautiful Array Definition**: An array is beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le |a| - 1 \)) such that \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
2. **Task**: Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `same` is initialized to 1 to count the length of the current segment of the same number.
   - `num` is initialized to the first element of the array.
   - `minn` is initialized to infinity to track the minimum length of any segment of the same number.

2. **Loop**:
   - The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
   - If the current element is different, `i` is incremented, `num` is updated to the current element, and `minn` is updated to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - `same` is reset to 1 for the new segment.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the length of the last segment.
   - If `minn` is still infinity or equal to the length of the array, it means the array is uniform (all elements are the same) or no valid segment was found, so the program outputs -1.
   - Otherwise, it outputs `minn`.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program fails on the input:
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
Expected Output: `1`
Actual Output: `2`

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Input Analysis**:
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the segments of the same number are:
     - `[1]` (length 1)
     - `[2]` (length 1)
     - `[1]` (length 1)
     - `[2]` (length 1)
     - `[1]` (length 1)

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program will iterate through the array and update `same` and `minn` as follows:
     - `i = 1`: `ar[1] == 2` (different from `num = 1`), so `i += 1`, `num = 2`, `minn = min(inf, 1) = 1`, `same = 1`.
     - `i = 2`: `ar[2] == 1` (different from `num = 2`), so `i += 1`, `num = 1`, `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`, `same = 1`.
     - `i = 3`: `ar[3] == 2` (different from `num = 1`), so `i += 1`, `num = 2`, `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`, `same = 1`.
     - `i = 4`: `ar[4] == 1` (different from `num = 2`), so `i += 1`, `num = 1`, `minn = min(1, 1) = 1`, `same = 1`.
   - After the loop, `minn` is updated to `min(1, 1) = 1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program will output `1` because `minn` is 1 and not equal to the length of the array.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies that the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is 1. The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program outputs `2` for this input.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True** (The given program is correct.)
