The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains four elements: `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the array, `q` is an integer representing the number of queries, `a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, and `queries` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `l` and `r` representing the query. The constraints for the parameters are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a query from the `test_cases` list. The result for each query is based on the elements of the array `a` and the query range `l` to `r`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `q`, `a`, and `queries`. The function returns a list of results, where each result is derived from the elements of the array `a` and the query range `l` to `r` for each query in `queries`.**
