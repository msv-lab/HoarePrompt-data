You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints the maximum number of draws that could have happened based on these scores, or -1 if the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes, and the variables `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, and `t` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly handles all the potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Score Validity Check**: The program checks if the total sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula ensures that:
   - The total points are distributed correctly.
   - The maximum number of draws is calculated by subtracting the excess points that cannot be accounted for by draws.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Let's verify the program with the given examples:

- **Example 1**: `0 0 0`
  - Total points: 0 (even)
  - No games played, so no draws: `0`
  - Output: `0` (Correct)

- **Example 2**: `0 1 1`
  - Total points: 2 (even)
  - One draw between the second and third player: `1`
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

- **Example 3**: `1 1 1`
  - Total points: 3 (odd)
  - Not possible to have odd total points: `-1`
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Example 4**: `1 1 2`
  - Total points: 4 (even)
  - Two draws between the first and second player, and one win/loss game between the first and third player: `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Example 5**: `3 3 3`
  - Total points: 9 (odd)
  - Not possible to have odd total points: `-1`
  - Output: `-1` (Correct)

- **Example 6**: `3 4 5`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Six draws (3 games ending in draws, each contributing 2 points) and one win/loss game (2 points for the winner, 0 for the loser): `6`
  - Output: `6` (Correct)

- **Example 7**: `1 1 10`
  - Total points: 12 (even)
  - Two draws (1 game ending in draws, each contributing 2 points) and four win/loss games (8 points total, 2 points per game): `2`
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs correctly, ensuring that the total points are even and calculating the maximum number of draws accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct.
