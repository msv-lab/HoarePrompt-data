Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by determining the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Winning Condition**: Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero. The key observation is that the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (considering their binary representations) can be paired off such that each pair has a zero XOR.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible. This can be achieved by removing pairs of numbers that contribute to a zero XOR.

4. **Calculation**:
   - `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2` count the number of pairs of each type of number that can be removed.
   - `int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)` checks if there are exactly three odd counts among the numbers of 1s, 2s, and 3s. If so, it means that removing one of these numbers will make the XOR zero, thus allowing Bob to win one more time.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total number of times Bob can win for each test case.

The logic and implementation are correct, and the program handles the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
