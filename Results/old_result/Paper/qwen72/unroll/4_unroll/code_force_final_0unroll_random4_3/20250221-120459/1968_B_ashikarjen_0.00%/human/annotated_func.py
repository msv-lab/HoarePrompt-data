#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order, `j` is the position in `b` after the last matched character, and the loop breaks when `j` reaches `m` or all characters in `a` are processed.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from the user, expecting two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the user. The function calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not handle multiple test cases as indicated in the comments; it processes only a single set of inputs. After the function concludes, `k` is printed, and the program state is unchanged except for the input and output operations.
