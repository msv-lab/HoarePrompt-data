Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from the user, expecting two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of two binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. It then reads the binary strings `a` and `b` from the user. The function calculates the number of characters in `a` that match a character in `b` in the same order and prints this count `k`. The function does not handle multiple test cases as indicated in the comments; it processes only a single set of inputs. After the function concludes, `k` is printed, and the program state is unchanged except for the input and output operations. **
