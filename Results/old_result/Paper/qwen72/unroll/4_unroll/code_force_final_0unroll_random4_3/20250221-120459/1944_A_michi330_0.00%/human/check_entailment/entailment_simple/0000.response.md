### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is the number of islands and `k` is the number of bridges that can be destroyed.

2. **Logic for Determining Reachable Islands**:
   - The function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule on island 1, making only island 1 reachable. Therefore, the function prints `1`.
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot isolate Everule on island 1 by destroying bridges. In this case, Everule can still visit all other islands, so the function prints `n - 1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k = 0`, no bridges are destroyed, and Everule can visit all `n` islands. However, the function prints `n - 1`, which is incorrect because it should print `n`.
   - When `k` is exactly `n - 1`, the function correctly prints `1` because Everule can only visit island 1.
   - For other values of `k` where `0 < k < n - 1`, the function prints `n - 1`, which is incorrect because Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

4. **Correct Output**:
   - The correct output for each test case should be:
     - If `k >= n - 1`, print `1`.
     - Otherwise, print `n`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The function has a logical error in the else block. It should print `n` instead of `n - 1` when `k < n - 1` because Everule can still visit all `n` islands in this case. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)
```

This ensures that the function correctly handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for each test case.
