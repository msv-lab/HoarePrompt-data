Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` but does not properly handle multiple test cases. It should use a loop to process each test case individually.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Invitations**: The program checks if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair exists. However, it always prints `3` if no such pair is found, which is not always the correct answer. The correct answer should be the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the best friend relationships form cycles or chains that require more than 2 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to identify the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. This involves identifying cycles and chains in the best friend relationships and determining the smallest set of invitations that will satisfy the condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a set to keep track of visited friends
        visited = set()
        
        # Function to find the size of the cycle or chain starting from a friend
        def find_cycle_size(start):
            count = 0
            current = start
            while current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                current = p[current - 1]
                count += 1
            return count
        
        # Find the smallest cycle or chain size
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i not in visited:
                cycle_size = find_cycle_size(i)
                if cycle_size < min_invitations:
                    min_invitations = cycle_size
        
        # If the smallest cycle or chain size is 2, print 2
        # Otherwise, print the size of the smallest cycle or chain
        if min_invitations == 2:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(min_invitations)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Cycle and Chain Detection**: The program uses a set `visited` to keep track of friends who have already been considered. It defines a function `find_cycle_size` to determine the size of the cycle or chain starting from a given friend.
3. **Finding the Minimum Invitations**: The program iterates through each friend and uses `find_cycle_size` to find the smallest cycle or chain size. It then prints the minimum number of invitations required.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all test cases and finds the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
