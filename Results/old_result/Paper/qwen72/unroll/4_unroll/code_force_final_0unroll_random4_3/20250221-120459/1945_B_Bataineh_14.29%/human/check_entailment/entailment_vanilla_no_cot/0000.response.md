Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. The condition `if m < a or m < b:` is incorrect. The visibility duration `m` being less than the launch intervals `a` or `b` does not necessarily mean that only two fireworks can be seen at the same time. It's possible that even if `m` is less than `a` or `b`, more than two fireworks can be seen simultaneously if the launch intervals are such that multiple fireworks from one installation are visible at the same time.

2. The calculation `print(m // a + m // b + 2)` is also incorrect. This formula does not account for the overlap of visibility periods correctly. It simply adds the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes from each installation and then adds 2, which is not a valid way to determine the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to determine the maximum number of overlapping visibility periods for the fireworks launched by both installations. This involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then calculating the number of overlapping periods within the visibility duration `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 1 + (m + l) // a + (m + l) // b - (m + l) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

Explanation:
- The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.
- The `max_fireworks` calculation determines the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously by considering the overlaps within the visibility duration `m`.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
