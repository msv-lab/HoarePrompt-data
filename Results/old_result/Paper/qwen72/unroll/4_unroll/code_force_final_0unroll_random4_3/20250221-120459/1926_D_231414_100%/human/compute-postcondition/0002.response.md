The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `times`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `times`. If `times` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `check` being 2147483647 does not influence the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be assigned values from `range(times)` during the loop's execution, starting from 0.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `check` is 2147483647**
