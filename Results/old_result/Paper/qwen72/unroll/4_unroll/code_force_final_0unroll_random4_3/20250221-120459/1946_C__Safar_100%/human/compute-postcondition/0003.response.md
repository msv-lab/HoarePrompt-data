Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list `g[a]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and `g[b]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `b` by an edge. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `c` is now assigned the value 0.
