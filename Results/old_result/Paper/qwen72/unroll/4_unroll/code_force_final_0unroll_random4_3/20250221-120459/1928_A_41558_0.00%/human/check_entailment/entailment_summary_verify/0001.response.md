### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-sized side will always result in two rectangles with at least one odd side, and combining them will not form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides. The key is to check if the resulting rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

3. **Checking for New Rectangle**:
   - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a/2 \times b\) rectangles. These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(a/2 \times 2b\), which is different from the original if \(a/2 \neq b\).
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times b/2\) rectangles. These can be combined to form a new rectangle of size \(2a \times b/2\), which is different from the original if \(a \neq b/2\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because there is no way to cut a 1x1 rectangle.
   - If \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting a 2x1 rectangle results in two 1x1 rectangles, which can only form a 1x2 or 2x1 rectangle, both of which are the same as the original.

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(n\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd. If so, it prints "NO" because no new rectangle can be formed.
   - It checks if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because the resulting rectangle would be the same as the original.
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" because a new rectangle can be formed.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the resulting rectangle is the same as the original.
   - The program correctly prints "YES" for all other cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Challenging the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program correctly prints "NO" if \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\). However, this condition is not entirely accurate. For example, consider the case \(a = 4\) and \(b = 2\):
  - Cutting \(4 \times 2\) into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and then combining them can form a new rectangle \(2 \times 4\), which is the same as the original.
  - The program will print "NO" for this case, which is correct.
- The condition \(a / 2 == b\) or \(b / 2 == a\) ensures that the resulting rectangle is not a 90-degree rotation of the original, which is a valid check.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided. The conditions and logic implemented in the program are sufficient to determine whether Bob can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

Final: **True**
