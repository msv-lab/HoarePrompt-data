You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the list of ship durabilities `nums`.

2. **Sum Check:**
   - The program checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n` because all ships will be sunk. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Attack Simulation:**
   - The program calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships separately using `a` and `b`, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the floor of `k / 2`. This is because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - The program then iterates through the list of ship durabilities, accumulating the total durability of the first and last ships in `s_a` and `s_b` respectively.
   - For each ship, it checks if the accumulated durability of the first ships `s_a` is less than or equal to `a` and if the accumulated durability of the last ships `s_b` is less than or equal to `b`. If either condition is true, it increments the `ans` counter.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Double Counting:**
  - The program increments `ans` for both the first and last ships in the same iteration, which can lead to double counting of ships. For example, if a ship is both the first and the last ship (i.e., the only ship left), it will be counted twice.
  - This is incorrect because a ship can only be sunk once.

### Correct Approach:
- To avoid double counting, the program should use a more controlled approach to simulate the attacks. One way to do this is to use a deque to manage the ships and their durabilities, and to simulate each attack step by step until `k` attacks are performed or all ships are sunk.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    nums = deque(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    while k > 0 and nums:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.popleft()
                ans += 1
            k -= 1
        if k > 0 and nums:
            # Attack the last ship
            if nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
                    ans += 1
                k -= 1
    print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in double counting the ships, which makes it incorrect.
- The corrected program avoids this issue by simulating each attack step by step and ensuring that each ship is only counted once when it sinks.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
