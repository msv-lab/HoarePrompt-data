The variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. The condition for the loop to execute is `r - l > 1`. Given the state right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`. For the loop to execute, `r - l` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `n - 0 > 1` or `n > 1`.

Since `n` is the length of the array and the array is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`array` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `find` is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n, `n` is the length of the array and `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is 0, `r` is `n`**
