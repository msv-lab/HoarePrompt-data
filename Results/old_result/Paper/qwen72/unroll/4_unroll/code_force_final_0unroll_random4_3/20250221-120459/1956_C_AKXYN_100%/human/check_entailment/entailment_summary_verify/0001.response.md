Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve setting rows or columns to permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is achieved by filling each cell with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since we have \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the total sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row.
   - It calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1) \). This formula is incorrect. The correct formula for the maximum sum is \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, alternating between Type 1 and Type 2 operations, ensuring that each row and column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \).
   - The operations are correct and will indeed fill the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) for each row and column, achieving the maximum sum.

5. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The program uses \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each row and column is set to the permutation \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \), ensuring that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Despite the incorrect formula for calculating the maximum sum, the operations performed by the program are correct and will achieve the maximum sum.
   - The number of operations is within the allowed limit.

Final: **False**

**Explanation**:
The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but it overlooked the fact that the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The program should use the correct formula \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \) to compute the maximum sum. Although the operations themselves are correct and will achieve the maximum sum, the output of the maximum sum is incorrect, which is a critical part of the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is not fully correct and the original assessment should be overturned.
