You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the value of n plus the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 2 to root inclusive)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the user input, where `1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6`. It calculates a new value `ans` by starting with `n` and adding the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). The function then prints the final value of `ans`. The input variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program defines a function `func_1` that is called for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\) (which should be \(m\)) from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to \(n\).
   - It calculates the square root of \(n\) and adds 1 to it, storing the result in `root`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive).
   - For each \(i\) in this range, it calculates `cnt` as \(i \cdot i\).
   - It updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // cnt\).
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
   - The problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) and ensuring that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The program instead seems to be calculating some unrelated values based on the square root of \(n\) and adding them to `ans`.
   - The loop and the calculation inside the loop do not match the conditions specified in the problem.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the correct output should be 14, as listed in the problem statement.
   - The program's logic does not match the required conditions, and it would produce an incorrect result for this test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. It does not implement the necessary logic to check the conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

Correctness: **False**
