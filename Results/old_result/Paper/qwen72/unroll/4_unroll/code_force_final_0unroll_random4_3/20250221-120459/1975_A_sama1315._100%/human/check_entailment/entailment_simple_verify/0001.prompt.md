You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `a` as input and checks if it can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation (splitting the array into two parts and swapping them).
   - The function first sorts the array `a` and stores it in `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a concatenated array `concatenated_a` by appending `a` to itself. This is a clever trick to handle the circular nature of the problem, as any valid split and swap can be represented as a subarray of this concatenated array.
   - The function iterates over the possible starting indices `i` of the subarray in `concatenated_a` and checks if the subarray of length `n` starting at `i` is equal to `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'. If no such subarray is found after checking all possible starting indices, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for reading input and handling multiple test cases.
   - It reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings `data`.
   - It initializes an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the `data` list.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of `data`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_1` with the array `a` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- **Function 1**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is correct. By creating a concatenated array `a + a`, it effectively simulates all possible splits and swaps of the original array.
  - The check `if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a` is a valid way to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by any number of split and swap operations.
  - The function correctly returns 'Yes' if such a subarray is found and 'No' otherwise.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once, which is efficient for large inputs.
  - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The results are collected in a list and printed at the end, which is the correct way to handle multiple test cases.

### Conclusion:
Both functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem as described. The logic in `func_1` is sound, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and output for multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
