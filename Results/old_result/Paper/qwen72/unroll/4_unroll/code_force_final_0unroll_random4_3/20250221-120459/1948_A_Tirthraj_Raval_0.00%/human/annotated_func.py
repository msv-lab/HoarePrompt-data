#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle input and output directly, as the input and output details are provided in the problem description. It should process multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: The loop will print 'NO' for odd values of n and 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'AB' or 'BA' repeated `n/2` times for even values of n. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `pattern` will be reset to an empty list for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a pattern string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
