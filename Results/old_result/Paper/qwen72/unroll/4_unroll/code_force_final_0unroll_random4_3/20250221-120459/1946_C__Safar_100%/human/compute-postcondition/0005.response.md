Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each list `g[a]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `a` by an edge, and `g[b]` contains the vertices that are connected to vertex `b` by an edge. `n`, `k`, and `edges` remain unchanged. `c` is 0. `l` is 1. `r` is `n // k`.**

The value of `r` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by `k`, which means `r` is the quotient when `n` is divided by `k`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
