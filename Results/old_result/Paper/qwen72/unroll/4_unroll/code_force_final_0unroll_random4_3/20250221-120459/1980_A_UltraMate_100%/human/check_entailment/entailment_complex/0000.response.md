Reasoning:  
The program correctly follows the problem description by reading the number of test cases, the number of problems and rounds for each test case, and the string representing the difficulties of the problems. It then calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed to ensure that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times in the string.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
2. **Counting Existing Problems**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
3. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the difficulty level is not in the counter `hmp`. If it's not present, it adds `m` to the answer `ans` because `m` problems of that difficulty are needed.
   - If the difficulty level is present but has fewer than `m` occurrences, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`.
4. **Output**: The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

This logic ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems required to hold `m` rounds, where each round needs one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program works as expected and produces the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
