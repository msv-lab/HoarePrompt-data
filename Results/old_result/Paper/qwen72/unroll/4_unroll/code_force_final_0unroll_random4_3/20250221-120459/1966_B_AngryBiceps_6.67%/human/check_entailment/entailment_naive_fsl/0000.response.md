Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it only checks the first and last rows and the first and last columns to determine if the grid can be made uniform. However, this approach is insufficient because it fails to consider the internal structure of the grid.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following grid:
```
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB
```

According to the problem description, this grid can be made uniform by selecting the corners (1,1) and (3,3), which are both 'B', and coloring the entire grid to 'B'. However, the program will output "NO" because it only checks the first and last rows and columns, and in this case, the first and last rows are different ('BWB' and 'BWB'), and the first and last columns are different ('BWB' and 'BWB').

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
