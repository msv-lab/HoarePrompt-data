Output State: **`u2vs` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex, representing the adjacency list of an undirected tree. `d` is a list containing the shortest distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices in the tree.**

Explanation: The code snippet `d, _ = bfs(0)` performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from vertex 0. The BFS algorithm computes the shortest distances from the starting vertex (0) to all other vertices in the tree. The result of this BFS is a tuple where the first element is the list of distances (`d`), and the second element (denoted by `_`) is ignored. The adjacency list `u2vs` remains unchanged, but the variable `d` now holds the shortest distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices.
