You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, x and y are integers for each test case such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

    #State: For each iteration of the loop, the variables `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the comparison of the digits of the input strings `a` and `b`. After all iterations, `kq1` and `kq2` will contain the strings formed by the rules specified in the loop, and these strings will be printed. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the digits in `x` and `y` are already in the optimal order to maximize the product. For example, consider the input where `x = 98` and `y = 89`. The optimal product is achieved by swapping the digits to get `x = 88` and `y = 99`. However, the program will output `x = 99` and `y = 88`, which does not maximize the product. The correct output should be `x = 88` and `y = 99` to achieve the maximum product of 8712. 

This shows that the program does not always produce the correct result for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
