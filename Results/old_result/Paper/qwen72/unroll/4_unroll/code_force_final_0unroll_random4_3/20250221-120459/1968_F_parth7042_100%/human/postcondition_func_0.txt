The function `func_1` reads input data, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results. Each test case involves an array `a` and a set of queries. For each query, the function determines if the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r` is zero or if there exists a subarray within the query range that has a zero XOR. The function prints 'YES' if the condition is met for a query, and 'NO' otherwise. The final state of the program includes the printed results for all queries across all test cases.
