Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program is designed to read all input at once and process it, but the problem description specifies that the input is given in multiple test cases, each with its own number of containers and their respective water amounts.

The function `func_1` is only called once with the entire list of integers, which is incorrect. The program should process each test case individually. Additionally, the program does not account for the fact that the sum of `a_i` is guaranteed to be divisible by `n` for each test case, so the check `if total_water % n != 0` is unnecessary and will always be `False` for valid inputs.

Here is a case where the program fails:
```
Input:
6
1
43
2
1 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
3
1 2 3
7
4 5 5 0 6 4 4
7
6 5 5 1 3 4 4

Expected Output:
YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
YES

Actual Output:
No
```

The program will incorrectly output "No" for the first test case because it processes the entire input as a single list, rather than handling each test case separately.
