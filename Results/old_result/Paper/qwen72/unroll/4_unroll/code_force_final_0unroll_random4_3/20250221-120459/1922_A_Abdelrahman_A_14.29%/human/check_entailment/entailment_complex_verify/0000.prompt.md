You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `tests` times, and for each test case, it will read `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`, it will print 'NO' or 'YES' respectively. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final states corresponding to the last test case, and the variable `no` will be `True` if the last test case did not print 'YES', otherwise it will be `False`. The variable `tests` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not present in either `a` or `b`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the variables `i`, `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` corresponding to the last test case, and the variable `no` will be `False` if any test case printed 'YES', otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `tests` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program checks if there is any character in string `c` that is not present in either `a` or `b`, and if so, it immediately prints "YES" and breaks out of the loop. However, this is not sufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
abd
aac
```
The program will output "YES" because the character 'a' in `c` is not present in `b`. However, this is incorrect because there is no valid template that can match both `a` and `b` while not matching `c`. The correct output for this case should be "NO".

The program should instead check if there exists a template that satisfies the conditions for all characters in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. The current logic is flawed and does not ensure that the template conditions are met for all positions in the strings.
