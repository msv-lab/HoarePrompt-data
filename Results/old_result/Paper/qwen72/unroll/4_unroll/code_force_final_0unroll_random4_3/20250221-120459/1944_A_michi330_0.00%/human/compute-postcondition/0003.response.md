The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` represents the number of islands, and `k` represents the number of bridges that can be destroyed. The constraints are: `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2`.

The function returns the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying `k` bridges.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` (number of islands) and `k` (number of bridges that can be destroyed), and returns the maximum number of islands that can remain connected after destroying `k` bridges.**
