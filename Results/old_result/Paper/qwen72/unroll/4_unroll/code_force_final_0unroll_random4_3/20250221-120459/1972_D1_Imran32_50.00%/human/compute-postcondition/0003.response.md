To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `root`, and the range parameters.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized to 2 in the loop head. It does not need to be adjusted.
2. **Variable `root`**: This variable is calculated as the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1. For the loop to execute, `root` must be at least 2, because the loop starts at 2 and goes up to `root + 1`.
3. **Range Parameters**: The loop will execute if `root + 1` is greater than 2, which means `root` must be at least 2.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers and `root` is calculated as `int(sqrt(n)) + 1`, `root` will always be at least 2 for any `n` greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the loop will always execute for valid inputs.

However, to explicitly state the conditions for the loop to execute, we can say:

- `i` is 2.
- `root` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the values of two positive integers input by the user, where 1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^6; `ans` is equal to `n`; `root` is equal to the integer part of the square root of `n` plus 1 and must be at least 2; `i` is 2**
