Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times. In each iteration, `n` is read from the input, and the variable `sum` is calculated as the sum of the series `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` from 2 to `n`. The value of `sum` and `2 * n` are printed. Then, for each `j` from 1 to `n`, two lines are printed: the first line starts with `1` and `n - j + 1` followed by the range from 1 to `n`, and the second line starts with `2` and `n - j + 1` followed by the range from 1 to `n`. After all iterations, the values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but the output will include the printed values for each iteration.**
