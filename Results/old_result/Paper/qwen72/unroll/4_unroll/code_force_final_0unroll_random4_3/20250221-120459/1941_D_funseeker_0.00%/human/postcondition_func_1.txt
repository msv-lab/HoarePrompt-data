The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value calculated by the function `func_1()`. The exact value of the integer depends on the implementation of `func_1()`, which is not provided. The function `func_2` itself does not modify any input variables or perform any actions other than calling `func_1()` and returning its result.
