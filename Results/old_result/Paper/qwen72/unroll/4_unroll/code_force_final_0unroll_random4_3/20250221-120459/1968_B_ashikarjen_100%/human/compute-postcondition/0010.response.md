Functionality: ** The function reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user, followed by two strings `a` and `b`. It then calculates the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear. This count is stored in `k`. After processing, the function prints `k` and does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the printed value of `k`, and the function has no effect on any external variables or state. **
