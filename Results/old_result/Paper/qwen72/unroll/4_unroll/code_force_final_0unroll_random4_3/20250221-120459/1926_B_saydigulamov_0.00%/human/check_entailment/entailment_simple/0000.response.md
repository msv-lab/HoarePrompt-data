Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads the grid row by row and appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k` if the row contains at least one '1'.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program attempts to determine the shape by checking if the first two counts in `k` are equal. If they are, it prints `k` (which is not the correct output format as per the problem description). However, this check is not sufficient to determine the shape correctly.
   - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same for all rows that contain '1's.
   - For a triangle, the count of '1's should follow the pattern of a triangle: either increasing by 2 (1, 3, 5, ...) or decreasing by 2 (5, 3, 1, ...).

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints `k` instead of "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE", which is incorrect.
   - The program does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle correctly. It only checks the first two rows, which is insufficient to determine the shape.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the shape is an upside-down triangle or a square of size 2 correctly.
   - The program does not check the entire pattern of the shape, which is necessary to ensure the correct shape is identified.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
