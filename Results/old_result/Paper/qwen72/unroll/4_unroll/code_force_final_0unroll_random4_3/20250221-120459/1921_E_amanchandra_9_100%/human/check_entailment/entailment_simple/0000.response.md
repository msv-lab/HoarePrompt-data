### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is correct for this context since it reads input directly from `stdin`.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. **Variable Naming:**
   - The variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are used to store the input values. However, these names are not consistent with the problem description, which uses `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. This could lead to confusion, but it does not affect the correctness of the logic as long as the variables are used correctly within the function.

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The first condition checks if Alice's chip is below Bob's chip (`a > c`). If this is true, the function immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot move up and Bob cannot move down, so they cannot meet.

4. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's chips is calculated as `abs(a - c) // 2`. This is the number of moves it would take for both players to potentially meet if they move optimally.

5. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - If the distance `abs(a - c)` is odd, the function calculates the range of possible positions for Alice's chip after `x` moves (`l` and `r`).
   - It then checks if Bob's chip can be within this range after `x + 1` moves. If so, Alice wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

6. **Even Distance Case:**
   - If the distance `abs(a - c)` is even, the function calculates the range of possible positions for Bob's chip after `x` moves (`l` and `r`).
   - It then checks if Alice's chip can be within this range after `x` moves. If so, Bob wins; otherwise, it's a draw.

7. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob".

### Correctness Analysis:
- The logic for determining the winner or a draw is based on the optimal moves of both players.
- The conditions and calculations are correct for the given problem constraints.
- The function handles the input and output correctly for multiple test cases.

However, there is a minor issue with variable naming that could lead to confusion, but it does not affect the correctness of the logic.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the given problem description and constraints.
