To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear.
   - `j` is the index in `b` where the last match was found or where the loop stopped if no more matches were found.

2. **Understanding `k`:**
   - `k` is a count of how many characters in the string `a` have a corresponding match in the string `b` in the same order.
   - For example, if `a = "abcde"` and `b = "abfgh"`, then `k` would be 2 because the first two characters 'a' and 'b' match in both strings.

3. **Understanding `j`:**
   - `j` is the index in `b` where the last match was found or where the loop stopped if no more matches were found.
   - For example, if `a = "abcde"` and `b = "abfgh"`, then `j` would be 1 because the last match was found at index 1 in `b`.

Given the initial state, the `print(k)` statement will print the value of `k`, which is the count of matching characters in the order they appear.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only describe `k` in terms of the given information.

Output: **k (where k is the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` in the order they appear)**
