Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the calculation for the case when `b - a < n`. The formula used in the `else` block is incorrect. Here is the correct approach for this case:

1. **Calculate the profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price**:
   - The profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)\).
   - This can be simplified to: \(\frac{k \cdot (2b - k + 1)}{2}\).

2. **Calculate the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price**:
   - The profit from the remaining buns is \((n - k) \cdot a\).

3. **Combine the two profits**:
   - The total profit is the sum of the two parts: \(\frac{k \cdot (2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a\).

The correct formula for the `else` block should be:
\[ \text{profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (2b - (b - a) + 1)}{2} + (n - (b - a)) \cdot a \]

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            k = b - a
            profit_from_modified = int((k * (2 * b - k + 1)) / 2)
            profit_from_usual = (n - k) * a
            print(profit_from_modified + profit_from_usual)
```

This corrected program should now produce the correct output for all test cases.
