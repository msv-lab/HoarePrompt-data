Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle input and output directly, as the input and output details are provided in the problem description. It should process multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: The loop will print 'NO' for odd values of n and 'YES' followed by a pattern of 'AB' or 'BA' repeated `n/2` times for even values of n. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `pattern` will be reset to an empty list for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a pattern string of length `n` that alternates between 'A' and 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
