Output State: **`n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original `a` list, `present` is a set containing the elements of `a`, `ans` is `x - 2`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans = x - 2` assigns the value of `x - 2` to the variable `ans`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain as they were assigned from the input, `t` remains a positive integer, `chosen_vertices` remains a list of `x` distinct integers, `a` remains a sorted list of integers, and `present` remains a set containing the elements of `a`. The only change is that `ans` now holds the value `x - 2`.
