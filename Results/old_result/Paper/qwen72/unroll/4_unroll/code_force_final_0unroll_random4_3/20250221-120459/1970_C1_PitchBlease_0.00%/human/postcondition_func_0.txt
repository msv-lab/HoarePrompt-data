The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree with exactly two leaves), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree and identifies the two leaf nodes. The function then calculates the distances from the starting node to each of the leaf nodes using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. If either of these distances is even, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'. The function does not modify the input parameters.
