The function `read` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with three integers n, m, x (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ x ≤ n), followed by m lines, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'). The sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
