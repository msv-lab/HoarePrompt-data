Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of constraints `n` and the constraints themselves. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - **Type 1 Constraints (`a == 1`)**: The program updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and the constraint value `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the largest lower bound for `k`.
   - **Type 2 Constraints (`a == 2`)**: The program updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and the constraint value `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the smallest upper bound for `k`.
   - **Type 3 Constraints (`a == 3`)**: The program adds the constraint value `x` to the set `cx`, which keeps track of values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the program calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid values (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the range `[bx, ax]` is empty (i.e., `bx > ax`).
   - It also correctly handles cases where the range `[bx, ax]` contains values that must be excluded (i.e., values in `cx`).

6. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `bx` and `ax` are always updated.
   - The program ensures that no two constraints are the same, so the set `cx` will not contain duplicate values.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
