Reasoning:

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared, which is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6`. The given formula is a combination of these sums, and it correctly represents the maximum possible sum of the matrix when each row and each column is filled with a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n`.

2. **Number of Operations**: The program prints `2 * n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2 * n` operations. This is correct because the program performs exactly `2 * n` operations, one for each row and one for each column.

3. **Operation Details**: For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, the program prints:
   - A Type 1 operation: `1 i *range(n, 0, -1)`, which assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the i-th row.
   - A Type 2 operation: `2 i *range(n, 0, -1)`, which assigns the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` to the i-th column.

   These operations ensure that each row and each column of the matrix is filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`. This permutation contains the largest possible values for the matrix, and since each row and each column is filled with this permutation, the sum of the matrix is maximized.

4. **Input and Output Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling `func_1` for each test case. The function `func_1` reads the size of the matrix `n` for each test case and prints the required output.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct in terms of both the logic and the constraints specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
