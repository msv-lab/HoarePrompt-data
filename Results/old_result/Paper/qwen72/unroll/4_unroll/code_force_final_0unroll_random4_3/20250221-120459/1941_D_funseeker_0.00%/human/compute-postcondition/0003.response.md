To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `m` times.
   - In each iteration, `func_1()` is called, which returns a string that is split into `r` and `c`.
   - `r` is converted to an integer.
   - A temporary set `temp` is initialized.
   - For each element `q` in `ans`:
     - If `c` is '0' or '?', `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
     - If `c` is '1' or '?', `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
   - After processing all elements in `ans`, `ans` is updated to `temp`.

3. **Effect of the Loop:**
   - The loop modifies the set `ans` by adding new elements based on the conditions and the values of `r` and `c`.
   - The values in `ans` are updated to include both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'.
   - The loop runs `m` times, so the set `ans` will be updated `m` times.

4. **Final State:**
   - After `m` iterations, `ans` will contain all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()`.

Given the initial state and the loop, the output state will be:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `x` remain unchanged, and `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the initial set `ans` and each `r` and `c` returned by `func_1()` during the `m` iterations.**
