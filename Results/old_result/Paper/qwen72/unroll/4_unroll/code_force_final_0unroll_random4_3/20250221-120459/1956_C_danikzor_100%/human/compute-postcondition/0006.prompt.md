You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving an n x n matrix and operations to maximize the sum of its elements, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the matrix size `n` and potentially other inputs as described in the problem.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: The loop iterates `n` times, printing two lines for each iteration `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line starts with the numbers 1 and 2, followed by the current value of `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n` (an integer representing the size of the matrix) and possibly other parameters related to the matrix or operations, and returns the maximized sum of the elements in the n x n matrix.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
