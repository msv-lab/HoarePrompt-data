Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal by applying the described operation at most once. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes variables `l` and `r` to the start and end indices of the array, respectively. It also initializes `st` and `end` to 1, which will be used to count the lengths of the initial and final segments of the array that are already equal.

3. **Finding Initial and Final Segments**:
   - It uses a while loop to find the length of the initial segment where all elements are equal (`st`).
   - It uses another while loop to find the length of the final segment where all elements are equal (`end`).

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The initial cost `ans` is calculated as the total length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`. This accounts for the scenario where either the initial or final segment is the longest segment of equal elements.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are equal, it updates `ans` to be the total length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`. This accounts for the scenario where the initial and final segments can be combined to form the longest segment of equal elements.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

The logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the segments of the array that are already equal and calculates the minimum cost to make the entire array equal by applying the operation to the smallest possible segment. This approach is efficient and handles all the given constraints and edge cases.
