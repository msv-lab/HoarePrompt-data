The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s`. It then constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a corresponding character in the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' and increments a count for each character used. The function prints the constructed string `r` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` remains a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` is the last read positive integer (1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5), `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `b` is a list of 26 integers representing the counts of how many times each character in `a` was appended to `r` in the loop.
