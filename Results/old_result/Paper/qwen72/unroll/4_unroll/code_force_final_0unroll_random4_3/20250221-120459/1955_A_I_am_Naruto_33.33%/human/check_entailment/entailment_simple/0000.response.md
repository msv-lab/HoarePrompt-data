### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - If `n > 1`, the function calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost if Maxim buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price.
   - The function then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - If `n == 1`, the function directly prints the cost of one yogurt, which is `a`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 1` correctly by printing `a`.
   - The program also handles the general case where `n > 1` by comparing the two possible costs and printing the minimum.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The constraints are respected: `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a, b <= 30`.
   - The program does not violate these constraints and works within the given limits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b`. It handles all edge cases and constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
