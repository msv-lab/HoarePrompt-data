Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case as specified.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be achievable, as each game results in a total of 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).

3. **Calculation of Draws**:
   - The function calculates `x` as half the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c`. This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points to the total score.
   - The function calculates `y` as the sum of `a` and `b`. This represents the maximum number of draws that could have occurred, as the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores gives an upper bound on the number of draws (since each draw contributes 1 point to both players).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is correct because the number of draws cannot exceed the total number of games played (`x`), and it also cannot exceed the sum of the scores of the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`), as the sum is even and the minimum of `x` and `y` is 0.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (e.g., `1 1 1`), as the sum is odd and it prints `-1`.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the minimum of `x` (0) and `y` (0) is 0, which is correct.
   - For `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the minimum of `x` (1) and `y` (1) is 1, which is correct.
   - For `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), and it prints `-1`, which is correct.
   - For `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the minimum of `x` (2) and `y` (2) is 2, which is correct.
   - For `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), and it prints `-1`, which is correct.
   - For `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the minimum of `x` (6) and `y` (7) is 6, which is correct.
   - For `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the minimum of `x` (6) and `y` (2) is 2, which is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to handle all the specified cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
