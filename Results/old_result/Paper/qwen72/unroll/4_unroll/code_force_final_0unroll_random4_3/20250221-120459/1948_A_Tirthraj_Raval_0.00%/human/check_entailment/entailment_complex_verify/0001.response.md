### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Check**:
   - The program checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters come in pairs (e.g., 'AA', 'BB'). The original assessment is correct in this part.

3. **Even `n` Check**:
   - If `n` is even, the program prints 'YES'.
   - It then constructs a pattern of length `n` by alternating between 'A' and 'B'. The pattern is constructed using a loop that runs `n // 2` times, appending two characters in each iteration:
     - `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])` appends 'A' or 'B' based on the parity of `i`.
     - `pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])` appends the opposite character ('B' if the previous was 'A', and vice versa).

4. **Pattern Construction**:
   - The pattern construction ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors, which satisfies the condition for special characters. For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern will be 'ABABAB', and each 'A' and 'B' will be a special character.
   - The pattern is then joined into a single string and printed.

5. **Output Length**:
   - The length of the constructed string is `n`, which is at most 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The original assessment is correct in this part.

### Additional Considerations:
- The program ensures that the string is of length `n` and that each character is a special character by alternating 'A' and 'B'.
- The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2. For `n = 1`, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have a special character in a string of length 1. For `n = 2`, it prints 'YES' followed by 'AB' or 'BA', which are valid strings with 2 special characters.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks for the possibility of constructing a valid string, and constructs the string as required. The output is also within the specified constraints.

Final: **True**
