Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It prints a result for each test case based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints `-1`. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints a value that satisfies certain conditions within a loop. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are not retained. The variable `t` remains unchanged. **
