Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, updating the positions and scores of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p` and the array `a`. After each test case, the loop prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables is not defined as they are re-initialized for each test case. The loop completes all iterations, and the output state is the result of the comparisons for each test case.**
