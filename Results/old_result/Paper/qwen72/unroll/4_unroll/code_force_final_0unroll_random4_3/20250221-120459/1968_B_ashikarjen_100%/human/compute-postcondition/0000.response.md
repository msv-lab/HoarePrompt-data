Initial State: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
```
n, m = map(int, input().split())
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. These integers are then assigned to the variables `n` and `m`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers based on the input provided, and the function definition is updated to include these parameters.**
