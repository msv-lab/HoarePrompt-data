Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and `n` sets of coordinates and radii from the user input, storing them in lists `x`, `y`, and `r` respectively. It then processes these sets using a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if there is at least one non-zero value in the `coef1` list after the DFS completes. If such a value exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After the function concludes, the lists `x`, `y`, and `r` contain the input values, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `True`, `coef0` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to `1`, and `nodes` is an empty list. **
