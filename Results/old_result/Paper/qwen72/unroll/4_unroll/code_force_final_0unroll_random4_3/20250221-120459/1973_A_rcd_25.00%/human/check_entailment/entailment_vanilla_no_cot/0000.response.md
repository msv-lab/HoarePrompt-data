Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases for the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Odd Total Points Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the points is odd, in which case it prints -1 because the total points must be even for the scores to be valid.

2. **Case When p3 >= p1 + p2**: The program prints `p1 + p2` in this case, which is correct because the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` if the third player has a score that is at least the sum of the other two players' scores. This is because the third player can have all the wins, and the other two players can have all the draws.

3. **General Case**: The logic in the general case is incorrect. The program uses a while loop to find a value of `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, and then prints `p1 - cur + p3`. This logic is not correct and does not always produce the maximum number of draws.

### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:

- The total number of games played is \((p1 + p2 + p3) / 2\).
- The number of wins is the total number of points minus the number of draws.
- The number of draws should be maximized while ensuring the points are consistent with the number of games played.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = total_games
        max_draws = total_points - max_wins
        
        if p3 > max_wins:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = min(max_draws, p1 + p2)
        print(max_draws)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Total Points Check**: If the total points are odd, print -1.
- **Total Games Calculation**: The total number of games is \((p1 + p2 + p3) / 2\).
- **Maximum Wins Check**: The maximum number of wins is equal to the total number of games. If the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the maximum number of wins, print -1.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The maximum number of draws is the total points minus the maximum number of wins, but it should also be limited by the sum of the points of the two lower-scoring players (`p1 + p2`).

This corrected approach ensures that the program handles all cases correctly and prints the maximum number of draws or -1 when the scores are not consistent.
