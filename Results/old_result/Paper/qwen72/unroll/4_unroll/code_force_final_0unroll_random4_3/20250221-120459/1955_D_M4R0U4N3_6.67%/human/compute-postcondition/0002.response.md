The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists `a` and `b`. Here is the description of the parameters:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
- `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters and lists, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, I cannot describe the exact return value without additional details. However, based on the provided constraints, the function likely processes the lists `a` and `b` and returns a result that depends on the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`.
