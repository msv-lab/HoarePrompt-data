The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input or a predefined method, consisting of multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_j < 2^31). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function processes these inputs and returns the results based on the processing of each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers. The function processes these test cases and returns the results based on the processing of each test case.**
