To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head, which in this case is the `range(mid)`.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `mid`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0.
3. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop condition is met**: The state should be adjusted to ensure that `mid` is greater than 0. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`, we need to ensure that `(right - left) // 2` is greater than 0. This means that `right - left` must be at least 1 (since integer division by 2 of 1 or more will result in a positive integer).

Given the initial state:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.

To ensure `mid` is greater than 0, we need:
- `right - left` to be at least 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and `right - left` is at least 1, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`**
