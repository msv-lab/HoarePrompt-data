You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n + 1):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` of size `n`. It then finds and prints the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` or, if all integers from 0 to `n` are present, the smallest integer that appears exactly once after the first integer that appears exactly once in `arr`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `arr` are undefined, and the program state is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to an array `c` and then removes it from `a`.
   - Bob removes the chosen element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` when both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by removing it from `a`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer `i` that is not in `arr` or is in `arr` but has been chosen by Alice.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
     - `first` is a boolean flag initialized to `False` to track if Alice has chosen an element that appears exactly once in `arr`.

   - **Iterating through the Range:**
     - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n`.
     - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and the MEX is `i`. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already chosen an element that appears exactly once, and Bob will choose the next one. The program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` is in `mpp` and appears exactly once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will choose this element. The program sets `first` to `True`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements from 0 to `n-1` are in `arr` and each appears at least once, the MEX will be `n`.
   - If `arr` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` and one of them appears exactly once, the program correctly handles this by ensuring Alice and Bob play optimally.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` when both players play optimally.
   - The logic for determining the MEX and the optimal play by Alice and Bob is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and will produce the correct MEX for the array `c` when both players play optimally.
