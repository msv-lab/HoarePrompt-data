Output State: **`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `ans` remain unchanged; `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `M1` is greater than 1, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.** 

In this output state, the variable `i` is assigned the value of the last element in the list `L` minus 1. All other variables (`N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `ans`, `cur`, and `nums_left`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
