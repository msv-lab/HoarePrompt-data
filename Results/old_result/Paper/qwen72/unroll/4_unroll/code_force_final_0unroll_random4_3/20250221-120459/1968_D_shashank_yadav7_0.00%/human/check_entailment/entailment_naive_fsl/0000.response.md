Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the way the scores are updated in the loop is incorrect. The program incorrectly accumulates scores by adding `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to `bm` and `sm`, respectively. This does not follow the rules of the game, where the score should be incremented by the value at the current position in the array `a` on each turn.

Additionally, the loop runs for `k` turns, but it incorrectly decrements `k` within the loop, which can lead to incorrect behavior if `k` is not exactly equal to `n`.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Actual Output:
The program will likely produce incorrect results due to the flawed score calculation logic.
