Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:`. This condition is incorrect because it should be checking if `b % 2 == c % 2` instead of `a % 2 == b % 2`. The variable `a` represents the number of test cases, and it should not be used in the logic for determining if a tower with `m` cubes can be built after `n` moves.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`. The correct answer should be "Yes" because Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times and then remove 2 cubes, resulting in a tower with 3 cubes. However, the program will incorrectly output "No" because it checks `a % 2 == b % 2` instead of `b % 2 == c % 2`.
