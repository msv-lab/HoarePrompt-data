Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2` with `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is responsible for simulating the game between Alice and Bob.
   - It starts by checking a special case where `removals` is 6 and `negatives` is 3, returning 0. This special case is not generally applicable and seems to be a hardcoded condition that may not cover all scenarios.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of the entire list `elements` and `n` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `removals`, updating `s` and `n` in each iteration:
     - `s` is updated by subtracting the `i`-th largest element (i.e., `elements[-i]`).
     - `n` is updated by adding the next `negatives` element and subtracting the current `i`-th largest element, with an `IndexError` catch to handle cases where the list is too short.
   - It appends the value `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos` after each iteration.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob should multiply the largest elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` attempts to simulate this by considering the sum of the remaining elements after Alice's removals and then applying Bob's strategy to minimize the sum.

4. **Issues**:
   - The special case `if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3): return 0` is not generally valid and may lead to incorrect results for other inputs.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the removal of the smallest elements by Alice. It should remove the smallest elements, not the largest ones.
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly handle the multiplication of the largest elements by Bob. It should consider the largest elements, not the smallest ones.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest `k` elements.
   - Bob should multiply the largest `x` elements by -1.
   - The function should correctly update the sum after Alice's removals and then apply Bob's strategy.
