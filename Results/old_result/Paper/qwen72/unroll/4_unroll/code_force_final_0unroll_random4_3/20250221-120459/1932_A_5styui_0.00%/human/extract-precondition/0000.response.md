Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings paths where each string s in paths has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and consists of characters '.', '@', and '*' representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. The first cell of each string is guaranteed to be empty.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def max_coins(t, paths):
```

With the precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and paths is a list of strings where each string s in paths has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and consists of characters '.', '@', and '*' representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. The first cell of each string is guaranteed to be empty.**
