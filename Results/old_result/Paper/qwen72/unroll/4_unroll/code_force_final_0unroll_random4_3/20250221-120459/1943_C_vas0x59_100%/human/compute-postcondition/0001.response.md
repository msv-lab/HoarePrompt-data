Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `u2vs` with `n` empty lists, where `n` is the number of vertices in the tree as specified in the initial state. Each empty list in `u2vs` will eventually store the vertices connected to a specific vertex by edges. The value of `n` remains unchanged.
