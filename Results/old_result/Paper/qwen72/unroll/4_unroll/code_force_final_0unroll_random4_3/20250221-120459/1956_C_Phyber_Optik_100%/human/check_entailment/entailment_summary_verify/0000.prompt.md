You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function calculates a sum based on a series and prints the sum along with `2 * n`. It then prints a series of lines for each `j` from 1 to `n`, where each line starts with either `1` or `2`, followed by `n - j + 1` and the range from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it produces the specified output for each test case. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all potential cases. Specifically, the sum calculation and the operations applied are not consistent with the problem description.

### Issues:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum calculation in the program is incorrect. The formula used in the loop:
     ```python
     sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     ```
     does not correctly compute the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The correct sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) should be:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} = n \times \sum_{k=1}^{n} k = n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
     \]
     For example, for \( n = 2 \), the maximum sum should be \( 2 \times (1 + 2) = 6 \), not 7 as the program outputs.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations applied in the program are not optimal for maximizing the sum. The program assigns the same permutation to both rows and columns, which does not necessarily maximize the sum. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations:
     ```python
     print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
     ```
     will result in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
     which has a sum of 6, but the program outputs 7 as the maximum sum.

### Correct Example for \( n = 2 \):
- The correct operations to maximize the sum for \( n = 2 \) could be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 1 operation on row 2: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 2 operation on column 1: \( [2, 1] \)
  - Type 2 operation on column 2: \( [2, 1] \)

  This results in the matrix:
  \[
  \begin{bmatrix}
  2 & 1 \\
  2 & 1
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  which has a sum of 6, the maximum possible sum for \( n = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum and the operations applied do not always maximize the sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
