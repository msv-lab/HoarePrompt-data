The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and an empty list `nodes`. The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` are of integers with the same length `n` (1 <= n <= 1000), and for each index `i`, the values of `x[i]` and `y[i]` are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], and `r[i]` is within the range [1, 10^9]. The lists `visited` and `coef0` are initialized to `False` and `None` respectively for each element, and `nodes` is an empty list. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function operates on predefined lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and an empty list `nodes`. It returns a value based on the input lists, but the specific return value is not specified.**
