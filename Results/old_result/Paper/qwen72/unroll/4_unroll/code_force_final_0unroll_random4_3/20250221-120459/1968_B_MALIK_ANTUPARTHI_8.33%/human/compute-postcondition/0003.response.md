The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function should handle up to `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, it is likely that the function returns a result for each test case, possibly indicating some relationship or operation between the binary strings `a` and `b`.
