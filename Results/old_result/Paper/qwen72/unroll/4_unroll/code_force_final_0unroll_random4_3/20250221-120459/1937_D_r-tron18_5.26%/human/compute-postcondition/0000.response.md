Output State: **s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. `pre` is a list containing the indices (1-based) of all positions in `s1` where the character is '>'.**

Explanation:
- The list comprehension iterates over the string `s1` using `enumerate`, which provides the index `i` and the element `el` at each position.
- For each position where `el` is '>', the expression `(i + 1)` is added to the list `pre`.
- The indices in `pre` are 1-based, meaning they start from 1 instead of 0.
- The length of `pre` will be equal to the number of '>' characters in `s1`.
- The values of `s1` and `n` remain unchanged.
