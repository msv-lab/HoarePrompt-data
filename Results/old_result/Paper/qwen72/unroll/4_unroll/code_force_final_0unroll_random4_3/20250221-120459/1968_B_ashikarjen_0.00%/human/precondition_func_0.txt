The function should take two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are binary strings, and two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
