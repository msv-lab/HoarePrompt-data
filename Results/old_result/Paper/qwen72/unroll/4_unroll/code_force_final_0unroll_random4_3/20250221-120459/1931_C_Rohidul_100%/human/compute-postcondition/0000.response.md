The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which should be the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since the loop does not depend on `n` or `a` directly in the loop head, these variables do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0**
