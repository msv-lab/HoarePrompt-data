Output State: **For each iteration of the loop, the output state after the loop finishes is that the pair of indices (prev, v1) is printed such that p_prev âŠ• p_v1 is maximized for the given permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. The loop iterates kp times, and for each iteration, the variables n, g, v1, and prev are reset and updated according to the logic of the loop. After all iterations, the final state of these variables is not defined as they are reset at the start of each new iteration.**
