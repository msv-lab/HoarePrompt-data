The function `func` processes multiple game scenarios. It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board `r` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. The function then determines and prints the outcome ('Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob') for each test case based on the positions of the chips. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The initial state of the variables `t`, `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` is not retained between iterations, and no variables outside the function's scope are modified.
