Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `a` from the input, and for `a` iterations, it reads two integers `b` and `c` from the input. For each pair of integers, it prints 'YES' if `b` equals `c`, 'NO' if `b` is less than `c`, 'Yes' if `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function does not modify any external state or variables outside of its scope. **
