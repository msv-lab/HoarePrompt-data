The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` from the input, followed by a list of `N` integers. It calculates the product of all integers in the list and then computes a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding element in the input list. It also calculates a value `den` which is the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns `None`. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces and returns `None`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not modify any external variables.
