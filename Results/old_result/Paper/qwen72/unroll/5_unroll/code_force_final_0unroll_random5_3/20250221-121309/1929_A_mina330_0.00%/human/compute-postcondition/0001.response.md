The only objects in the loop head are `itest` and `ntest`. For the loop to execute, `ntest` must be greater than 0, and `itest` should start at 0. The other details about the function parameters and the list of lists are important for the context but do not need to be adjusted in the loop head.

State: **`ntest` must be greater than 0, `itest` is 0**
