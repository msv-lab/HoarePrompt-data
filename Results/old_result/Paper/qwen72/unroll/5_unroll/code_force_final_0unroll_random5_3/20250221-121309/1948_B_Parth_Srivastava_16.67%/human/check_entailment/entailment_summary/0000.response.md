Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make an array sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting elements that are at least 10 into their digits. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that affect its correctness:

1. **Logic for Splitting and Inserting Digits**:
   - The program splits elements greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, but the conditions for appending these digits to the list `c` are not correct.
   - Specifically, the condition `if y >= c[n - 1]` is not sufficient to ensure that the array can be sorted. The program should check if the digits can be inserted in such a way that the resulting array is sorted, not just if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`.

2. **Handling of Single-Digit Elements**:
   - The program correctly appends single-digit elements to `c`.

3. **Final Check for Sorted Array**:
   - The program checks if the list `c` is sorted by comparing it to `sorted(c)`. This is a valid approach to determine if the array is sorted.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case using the function `func_1`.
   - The results of each test case are stored in the list `b` and printed at the end.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where the array might not contain any elements greater than 10.

6. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should correctly split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `45` into `[4, 5]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is sorted.
   - For the second test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the program should correctly split `12` into `[1, 2]` and `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`, which is not sorted.
   - For the third test case `[0, 0]`, the array is already sorted, so the program should print `YES`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the splitting and insertion logic, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, in the second test case, the program might incorrectly append `28` as a single element instead of splitting it into `[2, 8]`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
