### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
   - The array `N` is then sorted, which is a necessary step to facilitate the MEX calculation.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The function initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of each integer in the sorted array `N`.
   - The function iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1, which is a step to ensure that all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in `N`.

3. **Final MEX Determination:**
   - The function then iterates from 0 to `cur` to check if the count of each integer `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX is `i`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the MEX by ensuring that all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array `N` and their counts are at least equal to their values.
- The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is sound and follows the rules of the game.
- The final loop to determine the MEX is also correct, as it ensures that the smallest integer not present in `N` is found.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
