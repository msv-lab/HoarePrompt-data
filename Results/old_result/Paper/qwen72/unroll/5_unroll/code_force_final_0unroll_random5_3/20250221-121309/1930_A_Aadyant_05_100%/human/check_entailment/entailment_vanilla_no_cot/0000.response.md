Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and then the list of `2n` integers.
3. **Sorting and Summing**: The program sorts the list of integers and then iterates over the sorted list, adding every other element (starting from the first) to the score. This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score, which is optimal for maximizing the score.
4. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them one by one.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.
- By adding every other element starting from the first, the program effectively pairs the smallest elements and sums their minimum values.

Thus, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
