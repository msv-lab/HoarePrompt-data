#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `encoded` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order from the `unique_chars` list, and `len_unique` remains the same as the length of `unique_chars`.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, where each character in the original `encoded` string has been replaced by its corresponding character in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary that maps each unique character from `encoded` to its corresponding character in reverse order from the `unique_chars` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is created by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from a reverse mapping defined in `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `encoded` to the corresponding character in reverse order of the sorted unique characters. After the function concludes, the original `encoded` string remains unchanged, and the `decoded` string contains the characters from `encoded` transformed according to the reverse mapping.
