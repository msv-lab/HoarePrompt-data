You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function should internally read the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) and the values of n and k for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is 1, it prints `n` times the string consisting of the character 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string consisting of the first `k` characters of the English alphabet, repeated twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it is repeated once. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are unchanged after the loop, but the input has been consumed and the corresponding output has been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It internally reads a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676), and for each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26). The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
