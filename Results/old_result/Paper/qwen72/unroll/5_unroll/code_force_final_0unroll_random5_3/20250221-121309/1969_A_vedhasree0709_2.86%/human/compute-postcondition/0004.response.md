Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `l` of length `n` where each element `l[i]` (1 ≤ l[i] ≤ n, l[i] ≠ i, all `l[i]` are distinct) represents the best friend of the i-th friend. It checks if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+2) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i+1). If such a pair is found, it prints 2. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is reset for the next test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. **
