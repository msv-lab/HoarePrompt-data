Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input is not properly formatted or is invalid. Specifically, it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format and does not include any error handling or validation. For example, if the input for the number of integers `n` is not a valid integer, the program will raise a `ValueError` when trying to convert it to an integer. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the number of integers provided in the list is not exactly `2n`, which is a requirement according to the problem description. If the list has fewer or more than `2n` integers, the program will either produce incorrect results or raise an error.
