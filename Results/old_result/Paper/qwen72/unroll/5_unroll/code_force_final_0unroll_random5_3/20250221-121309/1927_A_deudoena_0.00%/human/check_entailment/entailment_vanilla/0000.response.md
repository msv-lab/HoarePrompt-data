### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that, when painted white, will turn the entire strip white.
   - The strip is represented by a string `s` of length `n` where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell.
   - At least one cell is black.

2. **Identifying the Segment to Paint**:
   - The segment to paint should cover all the black cells.
   - The minimum segment will start from the first black cell and end at the last black cell.

3. **Finding the First and Last Black Cells**:
   - The program uses two loops to find the indices of the first and last black cells.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first black cell from the left.
   - `ind2` is the index of the first black cell from the right (which is the last black cell from the left).

4. **Calculating the Length of the Segment**:
   - The length of the segment to paint is calculated as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
   - This formula works because:
     - `ind1` is the index of the first black cell from the left.
     - `ind2` is the index of the first black cell from the right, so `len(inpstr) - ind2 - 1` is the index of the last black cell from the left.
     - The length of the segment is the difference between the last and first black cell indices plus one (to include both endpoints).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the strip is entirely black, `ind1` will be 0 and `ind2` will be `len(inpstr) - 1`, so the length will be `len(inpstr)`.
   - If the strip has only one black cell, `ind1` and `ind2` will be the same, so the length will be 1.
   - If the strip has no black cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case is not possible.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The program reads the input string and prints the length of the segment.
   - It does not handle multiple test cases, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for a single test case but does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
