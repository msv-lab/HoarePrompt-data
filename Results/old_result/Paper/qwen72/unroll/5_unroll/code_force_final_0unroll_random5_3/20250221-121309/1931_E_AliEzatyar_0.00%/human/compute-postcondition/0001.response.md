The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop will execute if `len(num)` is at least 1, because the loop iterates from `len(num) - 1` down to 0. 

For the loop to execute, `len(num)` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
