Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` which is the largest number written on the board.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The program then iterates from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and calls `func_1(i)` for each `i`. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of `i`.

3. **Sum Accumulation**: The sum of the digits for each number from 0 to `n-1` is added to the variable `soma`.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the value of `soma`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Test Case Handling**: The program should print the result for each test case individually, but it only prints the final sum after processing all test cases. This means the output will be incorrect for multiple test cases.
- **Range Issue**: The loop `for i in range(n)` should start from 1 to `n` (inclusive) instead of 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) because the problem statement specifies that Vladislav writes numbers from 1 to `n`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
