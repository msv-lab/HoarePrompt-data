You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s.

    #State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string, `s` is a string of length n where each character is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array, `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where each element represents the number of times the corresponding character (from 'a' to 'z') has been added to `s`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` of length `n`, where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the `char_count` array. The `char_count` array represents the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been added to `s`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for reconstructing the string `s` from the trace array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of length 26, all initialized to 0. This list keeps track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

3. **Reconstruction of the String:**
   - The function iterates over each element `a[i]` in the trace array `a`.
   - For each `a[i]`, it searches for the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - Once such a character is found, it is added to the string `s`, and the corresponding count in `char_count` is incremented.
   - This process ensures that the character added to `s` at position `i` has exactly `a[i]` occurrences before it in the string.

4. **Output:**
   - The reconstructed string `s` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `11 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
  - Expected Output: `abracadabra`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that the first three characters are unique, the fourth character has one previous occurrence, and so on. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `10 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
  - Expected Output: `codeforces`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that the first five characters are unique, the sixth character has one previous occurrence, and so on. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 0`
  - Trace: `[0]`
  - Expected Output: `a`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that the string has only one character, which is unique. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace value with the character count.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
  - Trace: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected Output: `aaaaaaaa`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that each character has a unique count, starting from 0 and increasing by 1 for each subsequent character. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - Expected Output: `dijkstra`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that all characters are unique. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the string `s` from the given trace array `a` for each test case. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
