### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n` because you cannot perform any operations if `k` is greater than the number of cards `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums` and ensures that no frequency exceeds `k`. This is done by setting the frequency to `k` if it exceeds `k`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The program checks if any frequency in the `frequency_table` is exactly `k`.
   - If a frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform the operation to exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` new cards.
   - If no frequency is exactly `k`, it prints `n`, which is incorrect.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The logic for checking if any frequency is exactly `k` and then printing `k - 1` is not sufficient to solve the problem.
- The correct approach should involve reducing the number of cards by performing the operations as many times as possible until no more operations can be performed.

### Correct Approach:
- For each card number, determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
- For each set of `k` cards, you can reduce the total number of cards by 1 (since you exchange `k` cards for `k - 1` cards).
- The minimum number of cards left is the total number of cards minus the number of full sets of `k` cards that can be formed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            full_sets = count // k
            min_cards -= full_sets
        
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it does not handle the reduction of cards correctly.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
