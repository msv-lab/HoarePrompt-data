### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`
- **Purpose**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- **Behavior**: It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
- **Correctness**: This function is correct as it accurately checks if all elements in the list are zero.

#### Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`
- **Purpose**: This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the specified operation.
- **Behavior**:
  - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2.
  - For each index `i`, it enters a `while` loop if `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`.
  - Inside the loop, it reduces `list[i+1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i-1]` by `list[i-1]` times 1, 2, and 1, respectively.
  - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, it prints "no" and returns `None`.
  - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

#### Issues in `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Handling of the Operation**:
   - The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`.
   - The current implementation uses `list[i-1]` as a multiplier, which is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect reductions and potentially negative values in the list.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array might already be zero or where the array has elements that cannot be reduced to zero using the given operation.
   - For example, if the array is `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, the function should immediately return "YES" without entering the loop.

3. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The `while` loop can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly. For instance, if `list[i-1]` is 1 and `list[i]` is 2, the loop will not terminate because `list[i-1]` will always be 1, and `list[i]` will always be 2.

4. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The program prints "no" directly, which is not one of the accepted outputs ("YES" or "NO"). This is a minor issue but can cause the program to fail in some test cases.

5. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   - The final check in `func_2` uses `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero, but it does not handle the case where the array might not be zero after the operations. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function will not correctly reduce it to zero.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Input**: `1 3 5 5 2`
  - **Expected Output**: "YES"
  - **Actual Output**: "no" and "NO"
  - **Reason**: The incorrect operation implementation and the potential infinite loop cause the function to print "no" and "NO" instead of "YES".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all potential cases. The incorrect handling of the operation, potential infinite loops, and incorrect output format are significant problems that need to be addressed.

Final: **False**
