The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It modifies the list such that for each index `i` in the range 1 to n-2, the elements at `list[i-1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i+1]` are reduced based on the values of `list[i-1]` and the conditions specified. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the function prints 'no' and returns `None`. If the function completes the loop without early termination, it calls `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function prints 'YES' and returns `True`; otherwise, it prints 'NO' and returns `False`. The final state of the list is such that `list[i-1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2, `list[i]` is 1 or less for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the cumulative value of `list[i-1]` for all `i` in the range 1 to n-2.
