The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input `T`. The loop will execute based on the value of `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop head to determine the loop's execution.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
