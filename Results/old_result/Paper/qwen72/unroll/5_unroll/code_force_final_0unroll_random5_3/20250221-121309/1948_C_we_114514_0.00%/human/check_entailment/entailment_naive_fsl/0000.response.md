Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Here's a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves to (1, 2) and follows the arrow to (2, 2).
- It then moves to (2, 3) and follows the arrow to (1, 3).
- Finally, it moves to (1, 4) and follows the arrow to (2, 4).

The robot should be able to reach (2, 4), but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". This is because the program does not correctly simulate the robot's movement along the arrows and the grid's constraints. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility of the robot switching rows and continuing to move along the arrows.
