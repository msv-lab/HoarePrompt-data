The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function returns the new coordinates (x + dx, y + dy), where `x` and `y` are the original coordinates, and `dx` and `dy` are the changes in the x and y directions, respectively.

Functionality: **The function accepts two odd integer parameters `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a Quidditch field, and returns the new coordinates (x + dx, y + dy) based on the original coordinates (x, y) and the changes in the x and y directions (dx, dy).**
