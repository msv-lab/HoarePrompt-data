Output State: **`ntest` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive; the function should still accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array `a`.**
