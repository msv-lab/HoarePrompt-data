Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. It should take an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input and return either -1 if no such array exists, or a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the array, followed by a list of `n` integers, each in the range [-10^9, 10^9], that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.**
