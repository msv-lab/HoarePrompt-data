### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks into a list `arr`.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to count the frequency of each stick length in the input list `arr`.

3. **Polygon Formation:**
   - A regular polygon requires at least 3 sides of the same length.
   - The program calculates the number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length by dividing the frequency of each length by 3 and summing these values.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1` stick of length `1`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct, as no polygon can be formed with a single stick).

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2` sticks of lengths `1` and `1`.
  - Output: `0` (Correct, as no polygon can be formed with only two sticks).

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `6` sticks of lengths `2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3`.
  - Output: `1` (Correct, as we can form one square using the 4 sticks of length 3).

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `9` sticks of lengths `4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4`.
  - Output: `2` (Correct, as we can form one pentagon using the 5 sticks of length 2 and one square using the 4 sticks of length 4).

### Issues:
- The program assumes that any group of sticks with a frequency of at least 3 can form a polygon. However, this is not always correct. For example, if there are 4 sticks of length 2, they can form a square, but the program would count them as forming 1 polygon (which is correct in this case).

- The program does not consider the specific number of sides required for each polygon. For example, if there are 6 sticks of length 2, it would count them as forming 2 polygons, but it does not specify whether these are triangles, squares, or other polygons.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the given problem description, as it correctly counts the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 3. However, it does not explicitly handle the specific number of sides for each polygon, which is not required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
