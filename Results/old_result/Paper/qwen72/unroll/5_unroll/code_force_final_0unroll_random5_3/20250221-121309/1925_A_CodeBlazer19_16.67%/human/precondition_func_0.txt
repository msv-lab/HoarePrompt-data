The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function should internally read the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) and the values of n and k for each test case.
