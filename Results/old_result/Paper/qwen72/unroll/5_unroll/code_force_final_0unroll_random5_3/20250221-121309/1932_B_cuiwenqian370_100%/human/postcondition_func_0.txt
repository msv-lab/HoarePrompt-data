The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case involves a list of integers, and the function calculates the last year for each test case based on a specific formula. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `results` contains a list of strings, each representing the last year calculated for the corresponding test case, and these results are printed to standard output, each on a new line. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values.
