### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.

2. **Binary Search on Permutation**:
   - The program initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It performs a binary search on the permutation `p` to find the position `left` where `p[left]` should be equal to `x`.

3. **Swapping Elements**:
   - If `p[left]` is already equal to `x`, no swaps are needed, and the program outputs `0`.
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` array, the program outputs `1` and the indices to swap `left + 1` and the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - If `x` is seen in the `seen` array, the program outputs `2` and the indices to swap the first unseen element with `x` and then with `left + 1`.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation, which is not sorted. However, the problem allows up to 2 swaps to ensure that `p[left]` is equal to `x` after the search.
   - The program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and the positions of other elements that need to be swapped to make the binary search work.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not seen in the `seen` array and requires a single swap.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is seen in the `seen` array and requires two swaps.

6. **Constraints**:
   - The program ensures that the number of swaps does not exceed 2, which is within the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number `x` in the permutation using binary search with up to 2 swaps. It handles all the edge cases and constraints as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
