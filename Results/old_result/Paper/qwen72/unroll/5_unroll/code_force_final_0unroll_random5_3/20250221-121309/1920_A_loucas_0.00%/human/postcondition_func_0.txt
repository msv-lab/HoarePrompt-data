The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing constraints on an integer `k`. For each test case, it finds and prints an integer `k` that satisfies all the given constraints: `k` must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the type 1 constraints, less than or equal to the minimum of the type 2 constraints, and not equal to any of the type 3 constraints. If no such integer exists, it prints 0. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
