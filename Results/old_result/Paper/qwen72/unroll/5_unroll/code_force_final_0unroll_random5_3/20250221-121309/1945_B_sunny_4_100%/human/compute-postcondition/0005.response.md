Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates the value `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints `ans`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value of `ans` for the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not modified by the function. **
