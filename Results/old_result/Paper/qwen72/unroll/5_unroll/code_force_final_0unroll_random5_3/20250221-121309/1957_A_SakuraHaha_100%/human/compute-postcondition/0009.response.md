The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `stick_lengths`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `stick_lengths` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100), representing the lengths of the sticks for each test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks in each test case. If it is possible to form a square, the result for that test case is `True`; otherwise, it is `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `stick_lengths` where each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. It returns a list of boolean values, where each value indicates whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks in the corresponding test case.**
