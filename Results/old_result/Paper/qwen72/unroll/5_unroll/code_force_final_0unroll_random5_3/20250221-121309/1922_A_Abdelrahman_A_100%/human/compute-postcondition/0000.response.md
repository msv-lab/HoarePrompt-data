Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line is an integer `t` (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. `tests` is assigned the value of `t`.**

Explanation: The variable `tests` is assigned the value of the integer input `t`, which represents the number of test cases. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged.
