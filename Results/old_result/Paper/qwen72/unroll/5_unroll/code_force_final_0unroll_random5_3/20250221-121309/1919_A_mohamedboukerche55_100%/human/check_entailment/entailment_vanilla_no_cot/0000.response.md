Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. The logic used to determine the winner of the game is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd, and decides the winner based on that. However, this is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

The correct approach involves understanding the game dynamics:
- Alice always starts the game.
- Both players will play optimally, meaning they will always choose the best move to avoid losing.
- The game ends when a player cannot make a move, which happens when the player's wallet has 0 coins.

Given these rules, the game can be analyzed as follows:
- If both wallets have the same number of coins, Bob will always win because Alice will be forced to make the first move, reducing her coins to a state where Bob can always mirror her moves until Alice is unable to make a move.
- If the wallets have different numbers of coins, the player with the larger number of coins can always force the other player into a losing position by reducing the number of coins in their wallet to match the opponent's wallet or by making the opponent's wallet empty.

The correct logic should be:
- If `a` and `b` are equal, Bob wins.
- If `a` and `b` are not equal, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

This program correctly determines the winner based on the game rules and the optimal play strategy.
