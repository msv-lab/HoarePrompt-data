The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is a positive integer. The list `a` has a length of `n`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. The function returns the number of integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and a positive integer `n`. It returns the count of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice.**
