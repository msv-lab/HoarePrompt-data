Reasoning: 

The original assessment is incorrect. The provided program does implement the binary search algorithm and the logic to rearrange the permutation to ensure the binary search works correctly. Let's break down the program to understand how it works:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `t = func_1()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `(n, x) = func_2()` reads the length of the permutation `n` and the number to find `x`.
     - `p = func_3()` reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Creating a Dictionary for Indices:**
   - `num_indx = {num: indx + 1 for (indx, num) in enumerate(p)}` creates a dictionary where the keys are the elements of the permutation and the values are their 1-based indices. This helps in quickly finding the index of any element in the permutation.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program initializes `left` and `right` pointers for the binary search.
   - It then enters a loop that continues until `left + 1 < right`.
     - `mid = left + (right - left) // 2` calculates the middle index.
     - `seen[p[mid] - 1] = 1` marks the element at the middle index as seen.
     - If `p[mid] <= x`, it updates `left` to `mid`.
     - Otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - After the loop, it checks if `p[left] == x`.
     - If true, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
     - If `x` has not been seen (`not seen[x - 1]`), it prints `1` and the indices to swap `x` into the correct position.
     - If `x` has been seen but is not at `left`, it prints `2` and the indices to swap `x` and another element to make the binary search successful.

5. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program uses the `seen` list to track which elements have been encountered during the binary search.
   - If `x` is not found at `left` and has been seen, it finds two elements that need to be swapped to place `x` correctly. It does this by identifying the smallest index of an unseen element and swapping it with `x` and then with `left`.

The program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation and perform binary search as described in the problem. It ensures that the binary search will find `x` after at most 2 swaps, which is in line with the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
