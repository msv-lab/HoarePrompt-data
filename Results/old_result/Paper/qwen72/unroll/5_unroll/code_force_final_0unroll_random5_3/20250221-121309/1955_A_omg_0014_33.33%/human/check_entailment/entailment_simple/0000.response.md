### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
   - However, the problem description states that the input format for each test case should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, not `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a mismatch between the problem description and the program.

2. **Variable Usage:**
   - The variable `c` is used to calculate `d` as `c / 2`.
   - The program then compares `a * b` with `a * d` and prints the minimum value.
   - This logic is incorrect because `c` is not the number of yogurts `n`, and `d` should not be calculated as `c / 2`.

3. **Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic should be to compare the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`(n // 2) * b`) plus the cost of any remaining yogurts (`(n % 2) * a`).
   - The program should print the minimum of these two costs.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case `2 5 9`, the correct output is `9` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
   - For the test case `3 5 9`, the correct output is `14` because buying two yogurts at the promotion price and one at the regular price is cheaper.
   - For the test case `3 5 11`, the correct output is `15` because buying three yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two at the promotion price and one at the regular price.
   - For the test case `4 5 11`, the correct output is `20` because buying four yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than buying two pairs at the promotion price.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic for calculating the minimum cost. It uses the wrong variable `c` and calculates `d` incorrectly, leading to incorrect outputs.
