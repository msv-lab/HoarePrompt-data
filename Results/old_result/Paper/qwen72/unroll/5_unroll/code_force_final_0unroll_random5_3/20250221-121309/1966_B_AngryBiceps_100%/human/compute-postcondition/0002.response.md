The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, and `grid` is a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing only the characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a result based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, integers `n` and `m`, and a list `grid` of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing only the characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns a result based on the input parameters.**
