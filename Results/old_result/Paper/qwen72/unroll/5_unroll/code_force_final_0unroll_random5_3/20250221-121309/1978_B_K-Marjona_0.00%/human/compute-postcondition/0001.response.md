Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input, computes a value based on the given conditions, and prints the result. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained between iterations, and the loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope. Therefore, the state of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of `n`, `a`, and `b` is reset for each iteration.**
