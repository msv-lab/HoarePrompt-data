You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases t should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten in each iteration, and the loop variable `i` will increment from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop finishes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values read in the last iteration, and `i` will be equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing three digits (a, b, c) where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases is between 1 and 1000. The function returns the result of processing each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
