The function `func` is described as being called multiple times with different sets of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, where each digit is an integer between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The total number of calls `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters, which suggests that the function might be using external variables or a different method to receive these inputs. Since the function signature is not provided with parameters, we will focus on the output based on the given constraints.

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
- The total number of calls `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.

Output:
- The function returns a string or an error message based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since the function signature does not specify the parameters, we will assume the function is designed to handle these inputs in some way (e.g., through global variables, user input, or other means).

Functionality: **The function is designed to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9) and a total number of calls `t` (where 1 <= t <= 1000). The function returns a string or an error message based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.**
