Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it constructs the `char_map` dictionary. Specifically, the line:

```python
char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
```

This line is incorrect because it maps each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character starting from the end of the alphabet, rather than mapping it to the corresponding symmetric character in the sorted set of `b`.

To correctly decode the string, the `char_map` should map each character in the sorted set of `b` to its symmetric character in the same set. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_testCases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    char_map = {unique_chars[i]: unique_chars[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(unique_chars))}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

In this corrected version, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of the distinct characters in `b`, and `char_map` is constructed by mapping each character to its symmetric character in the `unique_chars` list. This ensures that the decoding process is done correctly according to the problem description.
