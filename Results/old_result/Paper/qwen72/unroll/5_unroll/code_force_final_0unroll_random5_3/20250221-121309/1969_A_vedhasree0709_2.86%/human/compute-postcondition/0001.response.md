Output State: The loop will execute for each test case and print either 2 or 3 based on the condition inside the loop. After all iterations of the loop, the variable `_` will be equal to the number of test cases, `n` will be the last input value of `n` from the test cases, `l` will be the last input list of best friends from the test cases, `i` will be `n`, and `j` will be either 0 or 1 depending on whether the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` was met for any `i` in the last test case. Other variables remain unchanged.
