The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the state of `i` is not defined, but it will be set to 0 by the loop itself. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
