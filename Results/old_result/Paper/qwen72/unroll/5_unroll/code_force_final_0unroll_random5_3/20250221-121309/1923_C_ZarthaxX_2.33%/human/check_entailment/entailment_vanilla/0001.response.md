### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays**:
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in the array `nums`.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and updates the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
   - `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
   - `sum[i]` is the sum of `nums[0:i] - 1`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to replace the single element with a different positive integer while maintaining the same sum.
   - For other queries, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l:r]` using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray `c[l:r]` using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

5. **Good Subarray Condition**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition:
     - `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
   - This condition can be simplified to:
     - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` can be split into a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `c`.

### Simplified Condition Explanation:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is the number of elements in the subarray that are not 1.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray, which is the total sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
- The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to allow for a different positive integer for each element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, preprocesses the array, and checks the condition for each query. Therefore, the program is correct.
