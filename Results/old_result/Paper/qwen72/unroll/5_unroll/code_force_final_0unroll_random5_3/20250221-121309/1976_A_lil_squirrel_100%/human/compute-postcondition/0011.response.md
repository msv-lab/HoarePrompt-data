The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the expression `len(password) - 1`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value, which means `len(password) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1 (i.e., `len(password)` must be greater than 1).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20
- `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits
- `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`
- `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`
- `letters` is sorted
- `digits` is sorted

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1 (since `len(password) = n`).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 20, `i` is 0, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from `password`, and `letters` is sorted, `digits` is sorted**
