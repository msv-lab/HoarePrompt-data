Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. Additionally, the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, so it should accept an integer `t` for the number of test cases. The integers in the list `a` should be between 0 and 99, and the length `n` should be between 2 and 50.**

For a more accurate function definition based on the problem description, it should look like this:
```python
def can_be_sorted(t, test_cases):
    # t is the number of test cases
    # test_cases is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n and a list of integers a
```

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, each test case in test_cases is a tuple where the first element is an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and the second element is a list of integers a (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
