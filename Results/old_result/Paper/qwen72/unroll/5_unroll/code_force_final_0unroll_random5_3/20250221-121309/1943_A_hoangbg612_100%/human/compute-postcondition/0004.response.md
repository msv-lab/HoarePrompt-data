Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N` of length `S`. It then sorts the list `N` and processes it to determine the smallest integer `cur` that can be incremented by 1 to ensure all elements in `N` are unique and in ascending order. The function prints the final value of `cur` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `T`, `S`, `N`, `cur`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset or consumed within each iteration. **
