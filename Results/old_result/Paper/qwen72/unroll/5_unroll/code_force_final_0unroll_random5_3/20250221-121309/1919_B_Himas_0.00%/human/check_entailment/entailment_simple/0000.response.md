Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array optimally, but the program simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints this difference for each test case. This approach does not consider the penalty calculation as defined in the problem statement, which involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The program calculates `P - M`, which is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. This is not the same as the penalty calculation required by the problem, which involves the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.
2. **No Subarray Splitting**: The program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty. It just processes the entire array as a single entity.
3. **Output Mismatch**: The output of the program is the difference `P - M`, which is not the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Parse the input to get the number of test cases and the string for each test case.
2. For each test case, convert the string into an array of 1s and -1s.
3. Implement a strategy to split the array into subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
4. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum them up to get the total penalty.
5. Print the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def min_penalty(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, s in test_cases:
        a = [1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in s]
        min_penalty = 0
        current_sum = 0
        for num in a:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum == 0:
                min_penalty += 0  # Penalty of a subarray with sum 0 is 0
                current_sum = 0  # Reset current_sum for the next subarray
            else:
                min_penalty += abs(current_sum)
        results.append(min_penalty)
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 5
test_cases = [
    (1, '+'),
    (5, '-----'),
    (6, '+-+-+-'),
    (10, '--+++++++'),
    (20, '+---++++-+++++---++-')
]

for penalty in min_penalty(t, test_cases):
    print(penalty)
```
