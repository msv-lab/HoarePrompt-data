t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, k, screenshots) with n and k being positive integers (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. screenshots is a list of k lists, each containing n distinct integers (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n) representing the order of participants as seen by the participant a_{i0} (the author of the screenshot). All authors of the screenshots are different.
