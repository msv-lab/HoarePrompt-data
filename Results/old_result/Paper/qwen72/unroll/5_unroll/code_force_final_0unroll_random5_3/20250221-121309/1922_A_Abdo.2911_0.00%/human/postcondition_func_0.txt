The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It then checks if the string `c` matches a template derived from `a` and `b` according to specific rules: the template is constructed by copying characters from `a` and `b` where they match, and using uppercase characters where they differ. The function prints 'YES' if `c` matches the template and `a` and `b` do not conflict with the template, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
