Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from a given list of stick lengths (each a power of 2) such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. A non-degenerate triangle is one where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in the input list. This is necessary because the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, and the same exponent can appear multiple times.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - The program then iterates over the counts of each exponent.
   - If a particular exponent appears at least 3 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using the combination formula \(\binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6}\).
   - If a particular exponent appears at least 2 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and one stick of any other length using the formula \(\binom{cnt}{2} \times total\_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total\_count\), where `total_count` is the cumulative count of all sticks processed so far.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result after processing all test cases.

### Analysis of the Execution Summary:
- The execution summary indicates that the function `func_1` processes the input correctly and calculates the number of ways to form triangles.
- The results are stored in a list and printed at the end, which matches the expected output format.

### Verification with Example:
- **Test Case 1**: \(7\) sticks with exponents \([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\).
  - All sticks have the same length \(2^1 = 2\).
  - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks from 7 is \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\).
  - The program correctly outputs 35.

- **Test Case 2**: \(4\) sticks with exponents \([3, 2, 1, 3]\).
  - Stick lengths are \([8, 4, 2, 8]\).
  - The valid combinations are \((8, 4, 8)\) and \((8, 2, 8)\).
  - The program correctly outputs 2.

- **Test Case 3**: \(3\) sticks with exponents \([1, 2, 3]\).
  - Stick lengths are \([2, 4, 8]\).
  - No valid triangle can be formed.
  - The program correctly outputs 0.

- **Test Case 4**: \(1\) stick with exponent \([1]\).
  - Only one stick, so no triangle can be formed.
  - The program correctly outputs 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, processes the stick lengths, and calculates the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles for each test case. The execution summary and the example test cases confirm that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
