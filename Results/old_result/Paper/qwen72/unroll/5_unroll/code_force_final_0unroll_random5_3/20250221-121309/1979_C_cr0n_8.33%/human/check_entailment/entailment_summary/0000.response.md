Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case using the `func_1` function. For each test case, the function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`. It then calculates the product of all the multipliers and uses this product to compute a list `vprod` where each element is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier. The value `den` is calculated as the product minus the sum of the elements in `vprod`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` because it is not possible to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod`.

However, the program has a critical flaw in its logic. The approach of calculating the product of all multipliers and then dividing by each multiplier to get the bets is not correct. This method does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Instead, it often results in a total bet that is equal to or greater than the winnings, which violates the problem's requirement.

A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. One way to achieve this is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then distribute the bets in a way that ensures the total bet is less than the winnings for any outcome.

Given the current implementation, the program will fail for certain test cases, such as the third test case where all multipliers are the same (e.g., `5 5 5 5 5`). In such cases, the total bet will be equal to the winnings, which is not allowed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
