Output State: **The number of test cases `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and the value of `s` is calculated and printed for each test case. The value of `s` is determined by the formula `s = (l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, where `l` is an integer input for each test case. The loop continues until `t` reaches 0.**

Explanation:
- `n` is initially set to the number of test cases, `t`.
- For each test case, `l` is assigned the value of an integer input.
- `s` is calculated using the formula `s = (l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.
- The value of `s` is printed for each test case.
- `n` is decremented by 1 after each test case.
- The loop continues until `n` (which is `t`) reaches 0.
