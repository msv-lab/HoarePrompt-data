### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_2` is used to read the integers for `n` and `k` and the lists `a` and `b` from the standard input. This is done using `map(int, putin().split())`, which correctly parses the input into integers.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The program initializes `arr` as an empty list to store the pairs of `(a_i, b_i)`.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case and reads the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The list `a` is negated to use a min-heap (since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default).

3. **Initial Sorting and Heap Population**:
   - The pairs `(a_i, b_i)` are sorted by `b_i` in ascending order.
   - The first `k` items (with the smallest `b_i` values) are pushed into the heap `k_arr` and removed from `arr`.

4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial `sub_sum` using `func_3`, which sums the `a_i` values in `k_arr` and adds the sum of `a_i + b_i` for items in `arr` where `a_i + b_i >= 0`.
   - It then iterates over the remaining items in `arr` and updates `sub_sum` by:
     - Subtracting the `b_i` value of the current item.
     - Adding the `a_i` value of the current item if `a_i + b_i <= 0`.
     - Pushing the current item into the heap and popping the smallest item from the heap.
     - Subtracting the `a_i` value of the popped item.
   - The program updates `max_value` if the new `sub_sum` is greater than the current `max_value`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum profit `max_value` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Heap Initialization and Usage**:
  - The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the `k` items with the smallest `b_i` values. However, the negation of `a` values is not necessary because the heap is only used to manage the `b_i` values, not the `a_i` values.
  - The heap should be initialized with the `b_i` values, not the `a_i` values.

- **Profit Calculation Logic**:
  - The logic for updating `sub_sum` and `max_value` is correct in terms of the algorithm, but the implementation is a bit convoluted.
  - The condition `if k_range != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `k = 0` correctly by not pushing any items into the heap.
  - The program also handles the case where `k = n` correctly by pushing all items into the heap and calculating the profit accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program is mostly correct in terms of the logic and handling of the problem. However, the unnecessary negation of `a` values and the redundant condition `if k_range != 0:` can be simplified. These issues do not affect the correctness of the program, but they do make the code less clear.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly calculates Alice's profit for each test case based on the given problem description and constraints.
