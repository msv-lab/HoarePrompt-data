You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts required. Both n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        
    #State: Output State: The loop reads lines from the input, processes each line to extract `n` and `k`, and then prints an array based on the conditions given. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). After all iterations, the loop finishes and no further changes are made to the variables `n` and `k`. The final state of the variables `n` and `k` will be the values from the last line of input processed. The output state is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values based on the input lines. **The output state is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values based on the input lines.**
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it processes `n` and `k` and prints an array or a `-1` based on the following conditions: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints an array of `k` elements, each being `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints an array of `n` elements, each being the index `j + 1` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `n-1`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all input lines, the function finishes, and the final state of the program is the sequence of printed arrays or `-1` values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate valid arrays for cases where \( k \) is 1 or greater than 1 but less than \( n \).

### Case 1: \( k = 1 \)
The program prints a sequence of integers from 1 to \( n \) when \( k = 1 \). However, this sequence is always sorted, and its cyclic shifts will also be sorted, which contradicts the requirement for exactly \( k = 1 \) sorted cyclic shift. For example, for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the program outputs `[1, 2, 3]`, which has 3 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 1]`, and `[3, 1, 2]`.

### Case 2: \( 1 < k < n \)
The program prints `-1` for any \( k \) greater than or equal to 2, which is incorrect. There are valid arrays that can satisfy the condition for \( 1 < k < n \). For example, for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 1]` and `[1, 1, 2, 3]`.

### Case 3: \( k = n \)
The program correctly handles the case where \( k = n \) by printing an array of \( n \) elements, all equal to \( k \). This ensures that all cyclic shifts are sorted. However, this is only one of the possible correct cases, and the program fails in other cases.

To summarize, the program does not correctly handle cases where \( k = 1 \) or \( 1 < k < n \), and thus it is incorrect.
