### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field, the players, the goals, and the movements.
   - It reads the initial state of the field and populates the `players` dictionary, `goals` dictionary, and `quidditch` list.
   - The `middle` variable is correctly calculated to represent the center of the field.

2. **Movement Function:**
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to handle the movement of players. However, the function is defined incorrectly. It should take the current position of the player and the direction of movement as arguments and return the new position.
   - The function `func_1` is defined as `def func_1(a, b):`, but it should be `def func_1(pos, move):` to match the intended usage.
   - The function returns the new position correctly, but the parameters are not named appropriately, which can lead to confusion.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop processes each action step by step.
   - For movement actions (U, D, L, R), it updates the player's position using `func_1`.
   - It correctly checks for collisions with the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
   - It also handles the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quidditch ball, ensuring the ball remains in the correct position.

4. **Catching the Quidditch Ball:**
   - The program attempts to handle the catching of the Quidditch ball with the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`.
   - This is incorrect because it should be an assignment (`quidditch[1] = mo[0]`), not a comparison.

5. **Throwing the Quidditch Ball:**
   - The program correctly handles the throwing of the Quidditch ball.
   - It checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - It also correctly resets the Quidditch ball to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

6. **Final Score:**
   - The program prints the final score after processing all the actions.

### Issues:
- **Movement Function Parameters:**
  - The function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `pos` and `move` instead of `a` and `b` to match the intended usage.
- **Catching the Ball:**
  - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.

### Correctness:
- **False** due to the issues in the movement function parameters and the incorrect assignment in the catching logic.

### Corrected Program:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())

def func_1(pos, move):
    x, y = pos
    dx, dy = move
    return x + dx, y + dy

for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        z = ''
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    z = k
            if z != '':
                del players[z]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                quidditch[0] = middle
            else:
                quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** after the corrections.
