The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, where `1 <= x <= 10^8` and `1 <= n <= x`. It then calculates the maximum integer divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n` and prints this value. After processing all test cases, `t` remains defined, but `x` and `n` are undefined. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
