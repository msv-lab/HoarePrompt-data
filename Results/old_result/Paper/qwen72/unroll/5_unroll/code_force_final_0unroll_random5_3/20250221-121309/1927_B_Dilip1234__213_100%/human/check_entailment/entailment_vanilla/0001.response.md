### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for reconstructing the string `s` from the trace array `a`.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` of length 26, all initialized to 0. This list keeps track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string `s`.

3. **Reconstruction of the String:**
   - The function iterates over each element `a[i]` in the trace array `a`.
   - For each `a[i]`, it searches for the first character (from 'a' to 'z') whose count in `char_count` matches `a[i]`.
   - Once such a character is found, it is added to the string `s`, and the corresponding count in `char_count` is incremented.
   - This process ensures that the character added to `s` at position `i` has exactly `a[i]` occurrences before it in the string.

4. **Output:**
   - The reconstructed string `s` is printed for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `11 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 1 4`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4]`
  - Expected Output: `abracadabra`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that the first three characters are unique, the fourth character has one previous occurrence, and so on. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `10 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]`
  - Expected Output: `codeforces`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that the first five characters are unique, the sixth character has one previous occurrence, and so on. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 0`
  - Trace: `[0]`
  - Expected Output: `a`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that the string has only one character, which is unique. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace value with the character count.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `8 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7`
  - Trace: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Expected Output: `aaaaaaaa`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that each character has a unique count, starting from 0 and increasing by 1 for each subsequent character. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0`
  - Trace: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
  - Expected Output: `dijkstra`
  - Reasoning: The trace indicates that all characters are unique. The function correctly reconstructs the string by matching the trace values with the character counts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the string `s` from the given trace array `a` for each test case. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
