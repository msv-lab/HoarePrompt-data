The code snippet `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` joins the elements of the list `results` with newline characters and writes the resulting string to the standard output, followed by an additional newline character.

- The list `results` is a list of `T` strings, each representing the last year calculated for each iteration.
- The value of `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, `index`, and `T` are not modified by this code snippet.
- The state of `results` remains the same, but its content is written to the standard output.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` for the final iteration, `a` is the last list of integers read from `data` for the final iteration, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is the total number of elements read from `data` (i.e., `T + T * n`), `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `results` is a list of `T` strings, each representing the last year calculated for each iteration, and the content of `results` has been written to the standard output, followed by a newline character.**
