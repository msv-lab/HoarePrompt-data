Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and lacks parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` as described in the problem. The parameters should satisfy the conditions: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `f` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
