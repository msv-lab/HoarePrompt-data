The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `k` and `arr` are not relevant to the loop head, and `pos` is also not part of the loop head. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` and `arr` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()` and `func_2()` respectively, `pos` is -1**
