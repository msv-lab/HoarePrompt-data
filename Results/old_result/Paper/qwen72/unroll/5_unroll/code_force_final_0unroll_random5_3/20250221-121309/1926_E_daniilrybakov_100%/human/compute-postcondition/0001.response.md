The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. Given that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is not used in the loop body and is simply a way to iterate a fixed number of times.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
