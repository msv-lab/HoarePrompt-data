### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Reconstructing the Permutation**:
   - The key observation is that `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.
   - To find `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i)`, we need to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to index `i`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n` (the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation).
   - It iterates from the last element to the first element of `a` (i.e., from `n-1` to `0`).
   - For each `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]` to ensure that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to index `i`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The algorithm ensures that `p` is a valid permutation because it always assigns the smallest possible value that is not yet used in the permutation.
   - The values of `a` are calculated correctly based on the definition of MEX and the given formula.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The algorithm also handles the case where `a` is a constant array (e.g., all elements are 1) correctly.

6. **Detailed Evaluation**:
   - **Initialization**: `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - **Backward Iteration**: The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`, ensuring that the MEX is updated correctly as we move through the array.
   - **Assignment**: `p[i] = mex - a[i]` correctly calculates the value of `p_i` based on the given formula.
   - **MEX Update**: `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to index `i`.

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `5` and `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
     - `p[4] = n - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`
     - `p[3] = min(5, 3) - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`
     - `p[2] = min(3, 2) - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`
     - `p[1] = min(2, 4) - a[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`
     - `p[0] = min(2, 1) - a[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`
     - The resulting permutation is `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the example.

8. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
   - The final state of the program is that `t` remains the same, `n` is the last input integer for the final test case, and `a` is the last list of integers input for the final test case. The list `p` will contain the calculated permutation for the final test case, and `mex` will be the minimum value in `p` for the final test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic and implementation are sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
