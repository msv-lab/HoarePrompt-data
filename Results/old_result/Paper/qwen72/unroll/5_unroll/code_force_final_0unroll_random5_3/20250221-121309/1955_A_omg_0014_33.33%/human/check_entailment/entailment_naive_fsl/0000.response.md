Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are incorrectly assigned in the input parsing, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Variable Assignment**: The program should take `n`, `a`, and `b` as inputs, but it incorrectly assigns `a`, `b`, and `c` to the inputs. This means the program is not using the correct variables for the problem.

2. **Flawed Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program should compare the cost of buying yogurts individually versus buying them in pairs (if the promotion is cheaper). The current logic does not handle this correctly.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
For the input:
```
4
2 5 9
3 5 9
3 5 11
4 5 11
```

The expected output is:
```
9
14
15
20
```

However, the program will produce:
```
10
15
15
20
```

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that follows the problem description correctly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying yogurts individually
        cost_individual = n * a
        # Calculate the cost of buying yogurts in pairs
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_promotion = pairs * b + remaining * a
        # Print the minimum cost
        print(min(cost_individual, cost_promotion))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the individual price and the promotion price.
