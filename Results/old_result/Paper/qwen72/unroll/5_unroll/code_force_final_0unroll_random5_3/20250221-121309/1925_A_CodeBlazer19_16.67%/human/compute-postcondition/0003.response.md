The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case consists of two integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function should internally read the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and is based on the values of `n` and `k`.
