The function `max_triangles` accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon. `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. `y` is an integer that is always 0. `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the remaining vertices of the polygon.
