#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a single line of input from standard input (stdin), splits the line into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers read from the input line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` generates a graph based on a set of vertices and edges, with the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` being integers within the specified range. It then processes the edges to find the minimum weight edge that connects nodes in the same connected component and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this minimum weight edge. The function prints the minimum weight of the edges added to the union and the number of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, followed by the list of nodes visited during the DFS. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

If the result of the `dfs` call (`res`) is not empty and contains `node_v`, the loop returns `res`. If no such `res` is found, the loop completes, and the state of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and `colors[curr]` remains unchanged.
    colors[curr] = 2
    return []
    #The program returns an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal in a graph. It accepts three parameters: `curr` (the current vertex), `parent` (the parent vertex of `curr`), and `path` (the current path in the DFS traversal). The function returns the current path in the DFS traversal if it encounters a vertex that has already been visited and is part of a cycle containing `node_v`. If no such cycle is found, the function returns an empty list. The function marks vertices as visited and processed during the traversal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature.

    #State: The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed `func_6()` `test_cases` number of times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves the number of test cases from the return value of `func_1` and processes each test case by calling `func_6` the specified number of times. The function does not return any value, and the state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged number of test cases and the completion of the test case processing.
