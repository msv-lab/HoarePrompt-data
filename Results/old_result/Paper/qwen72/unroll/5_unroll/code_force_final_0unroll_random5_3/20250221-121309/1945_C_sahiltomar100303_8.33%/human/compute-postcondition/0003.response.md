The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

The function returns the minimum number of swaps required to arrange all residents who want to live on the left side to the left of those who want to live on the right side.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the minimum number of swaps required to arrange all '0's to the left of all '1's for each test case.**
