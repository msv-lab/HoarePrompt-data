The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `T`. The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly relevant to the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `T` must be greater than 0**
