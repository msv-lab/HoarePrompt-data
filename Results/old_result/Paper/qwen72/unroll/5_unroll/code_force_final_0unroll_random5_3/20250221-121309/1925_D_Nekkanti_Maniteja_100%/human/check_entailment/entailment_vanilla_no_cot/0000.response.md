Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case.
   - It initializes the modulo constant `M` and the inverse of the total number of pairs `c`.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends in `a`.

3. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen.
   - However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated differently.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value for each excursion is the sum of the expected increases in friendship values.
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the friendship value of a chosen pair is the probability of choosing a friend pair multiplied by the current friendship value.
   - The probability of choosing a friend pair is `m / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
   - The expected value for the i-th excursion should be `c * (a + i)`, where `a` is the sum of initial friendship values and `i` is the number of previous excursions.

5. **Summation:**
   - The program should sum the expected values for all k excursions.
   - The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values after k excursions is:
     \[
     \text{expected\_value} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( c \times (a + i) \right)
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{expected\_value} = c \times \left( k \times a + \frac{k \times (k-1)}{2} \right)
     \]

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        
        # Calculate the expected value
        expected_value = c * (k * a + k * (k - 1) // 2) % M
        
        print(expected_value)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen, taking into account the modulo operation and the correct formula for the expected value.
