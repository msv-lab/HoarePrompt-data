Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' and '-' characters. It then calculates and prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `P` and `M` are reset to 0 for each new test case, ensuring that the calculation for each test case is independent. **
