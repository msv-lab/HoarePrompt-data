You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' character in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' character in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' character in `inpstr` when counting from the end, `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact value of `inpstr` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the result of this calculation.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. The approach taken by the program is to identify the first and last black cells in the strip and then calculate the length of the segment between these two cells.

1. **Reading the Input:**
   - The program reads a single string `inpstr` which represents the strip of cells.
   - This is incorrect because the problem description specifies multiple test cases, each with its own input. The program should handle multiple test cases, but it only reads one string.

2. **Finding the First Black Cell:**
   - The program uses a loop to find the index of the first black cell (`ind1`).
   - This is correct because it correctly identifies the first occurrence of 'B' in the string.

3. **Finding the Last Black Cell:**
   - The program uses another loop to find the index of the last black cell (`ind2`).
   - This is also correct because it correctly identifies the last occurrence of 'B' in the string.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length:**
   - The program calculates the length of the segment that needs to be painted white as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.
   - This is incorrect because the formula should be `ind2 + ind1 + 1` to correctly calculate the length of the segment between the first and last black cells, inclusive.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated length for each test case.
   - This is incorrect because it only prints the result for one test case, and it should handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases and the formula for calculating the segment length is wrong.

Correctness: **False**
