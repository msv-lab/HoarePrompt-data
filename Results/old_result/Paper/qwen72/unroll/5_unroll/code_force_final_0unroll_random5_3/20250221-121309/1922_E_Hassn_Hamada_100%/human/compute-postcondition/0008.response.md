To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the expression `size - overlap`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This is the loop iterator, and it starts at 0 by default in Python's `range` function.
2. **Expression `size - overlap`**: This determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `size - overlap` must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `size` is the largest `size` such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number`
- `overlap` is the corresponding `i` value
- `size_overlap` is a tuple where the first element is the largest `size` such that `(1 << size) - (1 << i) <= number` and the second element is the corresponding `i` value
- `sequence` and `number` remain unchanged

We need to ensure that `size - overlap` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. If `size` is greater than `overlap`, the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 0, `size - overlap` must be greater than 0**
