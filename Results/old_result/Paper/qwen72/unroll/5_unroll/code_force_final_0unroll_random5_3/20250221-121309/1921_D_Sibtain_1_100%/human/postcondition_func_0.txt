The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two lists of integers, `a` and `c`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of `a` equal to the corresponding elements of `c` by either increasing or decreasing the elements of `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the initial state variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged, and the program has printed the results for each test case.
