Output State: **The value of `s` is calculated for each test case and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged, and the variables `M`, `c`, and `a` are reset for each test case.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are read from input.
- `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), and `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- `a` is initialized to 0 and then updated by summing up the values of `f` from the `m` input lines.
- `s` is initialized to 0 and then updated in a loop that runs `k` times. The update formula is \( s = s + c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \).
- After the inner loop, `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- The variables `M`, `c`, and `a` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues for the next test case.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is that the value of `s` for each test case is printed, and the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged for the next test case.
