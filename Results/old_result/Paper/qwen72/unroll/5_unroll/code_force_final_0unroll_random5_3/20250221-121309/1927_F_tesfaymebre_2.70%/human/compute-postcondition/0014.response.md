To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `m` remain the same as their initial values.
   - `graph` is a defaultdict of type list with the same structure as before.
   - `edges` is a list of tuples sorted in descending order by weight.
   - `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class with size `n + 1` and updated parent and rank structures.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were added to the union.
   - `node_u` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight.
   - `node_v` is the node from the edge with the minimum weight.
   - `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0.
   - `res` is the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list.

2. **Variables and Objects:**
   - `_min_edge`: This variable holds the minimum weight of the edges that were added to the union. The exact value of `_min_edge` depends on the specific edges and their weights in the `edges` list.
   - `res`: This variable holds the result of the `dfs` function called with `node_u`, `-1`, and an empty list. The `dfs` function is typically used to traverse a graph and collect nodes or edges. The length of `res` will depend on the structure of the graph and the specific nodes connected by the minimum weight edge.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `_min_edge` and the length of the list `res`.
   - `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges added to the union, which is a specific numerical value.
   - `len(res)` is the number of elements in the list `res`, which is the result of the `dfs` function starting from `node_u`.

Given the initial state and the variables involved, the output will be:

Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges added to the union, and len(res) is the number of elements in the list returned by the dfs function starting from node_u)**
