Output State: **The function will have processed `t` test cases, where for each test case, it constructs an array `a` of length `n` such that `a[0]` is always 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The final state of `a` for each test case is printed as a space-separated list of integers. The variables `t`, `n`, and `x` will retain their initial values as they are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop.**
