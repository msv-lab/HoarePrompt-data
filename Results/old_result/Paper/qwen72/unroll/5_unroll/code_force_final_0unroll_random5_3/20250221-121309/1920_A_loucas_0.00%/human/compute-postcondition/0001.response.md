To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `iterable` and `loop`. The loop will execute if `loop` is greater than 0. The variable `iterable` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500.
- `loop` is an input integer.
- Each test case contains an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 100.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9.
- It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.

The only variables in the loop head are `iterable` and `loop`. To ensure the loop can execute, `loop` must be greater than 0, and `iterable` must start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, each test case contains an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 100, each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, it is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
