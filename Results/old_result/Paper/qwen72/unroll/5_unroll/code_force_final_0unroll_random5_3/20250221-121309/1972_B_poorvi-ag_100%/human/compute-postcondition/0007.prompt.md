You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n consisting of "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` will contain a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` will be equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing a list of strings, each either 'yes' or 'no', corresponding to whether the count of 'U' in each input string `arr` is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is still equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` representing the initial state of the coins. It returns a list of integers, where each integer is the minimum number of moves required to make all coins in the corresponding test case face the same direction.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
