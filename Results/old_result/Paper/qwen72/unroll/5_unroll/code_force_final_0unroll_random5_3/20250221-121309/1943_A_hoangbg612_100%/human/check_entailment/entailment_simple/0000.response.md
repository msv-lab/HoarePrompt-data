### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is correct according to the problem description.
   - It reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting and Processing**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach because it allows us to process the elements in ascending order.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the frequency of each element in the array `N`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final MEX Adjustment**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is incorrect because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, not the sum of frequencies.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the frequency is 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`. This is also incorrect because it does not necessarily ensure the MEX is calculated correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The logic for adjusting `cur` based on the sum of frequencies is incorrect. The MEX should be determined by the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, not by the sum of frequencies.
  - The logic for setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` is also incorrect. It does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach to determine the MEX is to:
  - Track the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c` after each move.
  - Alice should always try to pick the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` to maximize the MEX.
  - Bob should try to pick the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c` to minimize the MEX, but he cannot pick the same integer that Alice just picked.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
