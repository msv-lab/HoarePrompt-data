You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two integers, n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function should internally read the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) and the values of n and k for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is 1, it prints `n` times the string consisting of the character 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string consisting of the first `k` characters of the English alphabet, repeated twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it is repeated once. The variables `n`, `k`, and `t` are unchanged after the loop, but the input has been consumed and the corresponding output has been printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) from the input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, it prints a string consisting of `n` times the character 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the English alphabet, repeated twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it is repeated once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for generating the string `s` and the condition `(2 - (n == 1)) * s` does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `k = 2`. The program will generate the string `s = 'ab'` and then print `s` repeated twice, which results in `s = 'abab'`. However, the string `s = 'abab'` does not contain all possible strings of length 3 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets as subsequences. The possible strings of length 3 are `aaa`, `aab`, `aba`, `abb`, `baa`, `bab`, `bba`, and `bbb`. The string `abab` does not contain `aaa`, `aab`, `abb`, `baa`, `bab`, `bba`, or `bbb` as subsequences.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
