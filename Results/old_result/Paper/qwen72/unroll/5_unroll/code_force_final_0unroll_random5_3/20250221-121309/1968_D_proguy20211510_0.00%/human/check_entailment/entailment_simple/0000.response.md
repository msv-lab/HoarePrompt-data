### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The variable `maxa` is set to the maximum value in the array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The function checks if both players start at positions with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if Bodya starts at a position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - It checks if Sasha starts at a position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has reached a position with the maximum value in `a`.
   - The game is simulated for `k` turns. During each turn:
     - If both players have already found a position with the maximum value, the function appends the remaining turns' scores as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both lists.
     - If only Bodya has found a position with the maximum value, the function appends `maxa` to Bodya's score list.
     - If only Sasha has found a position with the maximum value, the function appends `maxa` to Sasha's score list.
     - If neither player has found a position with the maximum value, the function appends the current score and updates the position based on the permutation `p`.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the prefix sums of the scores for both players and stores them in `preb` and `pres`.

5. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the final scores for both players by adding the remaining turns' scores to the prefix sums.
   - It then determines the maximum score for both players and compares them to decide the winner.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Turns:**
  - The logic for appending remaining turns' scores as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` is incorrect. This assumes that the player will stay at the maximum value position for all remaining turns, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to simulate the game for all `k` turns or until a cycle is detected.

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The function does not handle cycles in the permutation. If the permutation contains cycles, the players might end up in a loop, and the function should account for this to avoid infinite loops.

- **Unnecessary Variables:**
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `alpha` are not used in the function and can be removed.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly handle the game simulation for all `k` turns, especially when cycles are present in the permutation.
- The logic for appending remaining turns' scores is flawed and does not accurately reflect the game rules.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
