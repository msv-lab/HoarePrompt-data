Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the optimal position for the road is before the first house or after the last house correctly. Specifically, the logic for checking the conditions when `left == 0` and `right == n` is flawed. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
100
```

The correct output should be `0` because laying the road before the first house satisfies the condition (all 3 residents want to live on the left side, and there are 3 zeros). However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. This is because the program does not correctly handle the edge case where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house.
