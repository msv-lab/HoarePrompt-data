### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - The string `s` represents an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to split the array in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of a subarray is zero, its penalty is zero.
   - If the sum of a subarray is non-zero, the penalty is minimized by making the subarray as short as possible.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then splits the string `expression` by the character `-` to get subarrays of `+` characters.
   - The program calculates the total length of these subarrays and calls `func_1` with the `expression` and the total length.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes `count` and `balance` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`:
     - If the character is `+`, it increments the `balance`.
     - If the character is `-`, it decrements the `balance`.
     - If the `balance` goes below zero, it increments the `count` and resets the `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which means:
     - `count` is the number of times the `balance` went below zero.
     - `(balance > 0)` is an additional penalty if the final `balance` is positive.

5. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The strategy of resetting the `balance` to zero whenever it goes below zero ensures that we are minimizing the penalty by breaking the array into subarrays where the sum is zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - The additional penalty `(balance > 0)` accounts for any remaining positive balance that cannot be split further without increasing the penalty.

6. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For `expression = "+"`, the balance never goes below zero, and the final balance is 1, so the penalty is `0 + 1 = 1`.
   - For `expression = "-----"`, the balance goes below zero 5 times, and the final balance is 0, so the penalty is `5 + 0 = 5`.
   - For `expression = "+-+-+-"`, the balance never goes below zero, and the final balance is 0, so the penalty is `0 + 0 = 0`.
   - For `expression = "--+++++++-"`, the balance goes below zero 2 times, and the final balance is 1, so the penalty is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For `expression = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, the balance goes below zero 4 times, and the final balance is 0, so the penalty is `4 + 0 = 4`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the strategy to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into subarrays where the sum is zero or as close to zero as possible. The additional penalty for a positive final balance is also correctly handled.

Correctness: **True**
