Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases, the number of signs for each test case, and the periodicities of the signs.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` to the periodicity of the first sign.
   - It then iterates through the remaining signs, calculating the next year in which each sign will occur strictly after the previous sign.
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to a list and writes the results to standard output, each on a new line.

This approach correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The program also handles multiple test cases as required by the problem description.
