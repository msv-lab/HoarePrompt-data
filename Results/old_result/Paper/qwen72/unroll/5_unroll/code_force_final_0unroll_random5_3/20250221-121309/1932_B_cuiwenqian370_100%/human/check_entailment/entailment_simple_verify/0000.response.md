Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling large inputs.
   - The variable `T` is correctly set to the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Initial Year Calculation**:
   - The initial year for the first sign is correctly set to `a[0]`.

3. **Sequential Year Calculation**:
   - The program uses the formula `next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to calculate the year of the next sign.
   - This formula ensures that the next sign occurs in the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The formula can be broken down as follows:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i]` calculates the smallest integer `k` such that `k * a[i]` is greater than `last_year + 1`.
     - Multiplying `k` by `a[i]` gives the next year when the i-th sign occurs.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The results for each test case are collected in the `results` list.
   - The final output is correctly formatted by joining the results with newlines and writing them to `sys.stdout`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly. In this case, the only sign occurs in the year `a[0]`.
   - The program also handles the edge case where all periodicities are 1, ensuring that the signs occur in consecutive years.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case with `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 3.
     - The second sign occurs in year 4.
     - The third sign occurs in year 8.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 10.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 18.
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 36.
   - For the second test case with `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the third test case with `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 1.
     - The second sign occurs in year 2.
     - The third sign occurs in year 3.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 4.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 5.
   - For the fourth test case with `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`:
     - The first sign occurs in year 50.
     - The second sign occurs in year 60.
     - The third sign occurs in year 711.
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 800.
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 1006.
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 2012.

The program's logic and implementation align with the problem statement and handle all provided examples correctly. There are no apparent issues with the program's handling of valid inputs.

Final: **True**
