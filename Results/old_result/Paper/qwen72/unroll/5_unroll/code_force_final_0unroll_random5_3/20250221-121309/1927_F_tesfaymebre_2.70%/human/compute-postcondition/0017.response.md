Functionality: ** The function `func_6` generates a graph based on a set of vertices and edges, with the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` being integers within the specified range. It then processes the edges to find the minimum weight edge that connects nodes in the same connected component and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes of this minimum weight edge. The function prints the minimum weight of the edges added to the union and the number of nodes visited during the DFS traversal, followed by the list of nodes visited during the DFS. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
