Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference as the output for each test case. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and then calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

Here's a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

1. For each test case, read the length `n` and the string `s`.
2. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where each '+' is 1 and each '-' is -1.
3. To minimize the penalty, consider splitting the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. This can be achieved by splitting the array at every change of sign (from '+' to '-' or vice versa), which ensures that each subarray has a sum of 0 or is as small as possible.
4. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum these penalties to get the total minimum penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        
        a = [1 if c == '+' else -1 for c in s]
        penalty = 0
        current_sum = 0
        
        for num in a:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum == 0:
                penalty += 0
                current_sum = 0
            else:
                penalty += abs(current_sum)
        
        results.append(penalty)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program reads all input at once to handle multiple test cases efficiently, converts the string to an array of 1s and -1s, and calculates the minimum penalty by splitting the array at every change of sign. The results are stored and printed at the end.
