Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle the movement of entities and the elimination of players, respectively. However, the program does not handle the scoring mechanism, the initial setup of the field, or the main game loop that processes the actions. This means that the program is incomplete and does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which specifies that the program should output the main events of the game, including goals and eliminations, and the final score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
