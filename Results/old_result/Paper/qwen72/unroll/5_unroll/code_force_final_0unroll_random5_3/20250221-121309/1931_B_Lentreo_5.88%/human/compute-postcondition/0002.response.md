Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. After processing, it prints 'YES' if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums` is zero, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged outside of the loop, but `n` and `nums` are redefined within each iteration.**
