Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray is of length 1 (i.e., `x == y`). According to the problem description, a subarray of length 1 cannot be good because there cannot exist a `b_i` such that `a_i != b_i` and `b_i > 0`. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for such cases, which violates the problem description. For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
4 4
```

The program will print "YES" for the query `4 4`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "NO" because the subarray `c[4]` is of length 1 and cannot be good.
