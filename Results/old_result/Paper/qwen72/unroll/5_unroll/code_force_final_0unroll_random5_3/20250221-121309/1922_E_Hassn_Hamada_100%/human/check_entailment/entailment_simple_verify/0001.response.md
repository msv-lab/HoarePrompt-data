### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires generating an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - If no such array exists, we should print \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` to generate the required sequence.
   - The sequence is then printed along with its length.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that will have a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a bit manipulation approach to determine the size and overlap of the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` to find a suitable size and overlap such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `number`.

4. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - The expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i + 1`.
   - This is based on the fact that a sequence of length `i + 1` can have \( 2^{i+1} - 2^i = 2^i \) increasing subsequences.
   - The function then appends the necessary elements to the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Recursive Call:**
   - After appending the elements, the function recursively calls itself to handle the remaining number of increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call is made with the updated number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The function ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 by using a loop that iterates over possible values of `i`.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated (which should not happen given the constraints), it prints \(-1\).

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `number` is an integer such that \( 2 \le \text{number} \le 10^{18} \).
  - `sequence` is an empty list.

- **Base Case:**
  - If `number` is 0, the function returns `(0, 0)`, which is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 0 increasing subsequences.

- **Finding the Size and Overlap:**
  - The loop iterates over possible values of `i` from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
  - For each `i`, it calculates the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed with a sequence of length `i + 1` using the expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`.
  - It then increases the size until the number of increasing subsequences exceeds `number`.
  - If a suitable size and overlap are found, it breaks the loop and sets `size_overlap` to `(size, i)`.

- **Appending Elements:**
  - The function appends integers from `overlap` to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
  - This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing and the number of increasing subsequences is correctly accounted for.

- **Recursive Call:**
  - The function recursively calls itself with the updated number `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.
  - This ensures that the remaining number of increasing subsequences is handled correctly.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the structure and approach of the program.
- The bit manipulation and recursive approach are sound and should handle the given constraints effectively.
- The program ensures that the sequence length does not exceed 200 and that the elements are within the specified range.

### Final Evaluation:

The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. The bit manipulation and recursive approach are well-suited to generating the required sequence of integers with exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.

Final: **True**
