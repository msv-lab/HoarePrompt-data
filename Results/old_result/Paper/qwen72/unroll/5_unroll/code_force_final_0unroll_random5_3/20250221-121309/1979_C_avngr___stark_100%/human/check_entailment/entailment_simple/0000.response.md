### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, if it wins, the player receives `k_i * x_i` coins, where `x_i` is the amount bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount bet should be less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, i.e., `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k` for each outcome.
   - It then calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers using `func_2` and `func_1`.
   - The LCM is used to determine the bets `x_i` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - This is correct because `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)` is a standard formula for calculating the LCM.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the elements.
   - This is correct because the LCM of multiple numbers can be found by iteratively applying the LCM formula to pairs of numbers.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the bets `x_i` as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM of all `k_i`.
   - It then checks if the sum of these bets is less than `m`.
   - If the sum is less than `m`, the bets are valid and are printed.
   - If the sum is not less than `m`, it prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the sum of the bets is not less than `m` by printing `-1`.
   - It also handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over the number of test cases `t`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM of the multipliers. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to calculate the LCM, and the main logic ensures that the bets are valid or prints `-1` if no valid distribution is possible.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
