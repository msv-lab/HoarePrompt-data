You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Input

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters by shooting them before they reach the player. The final state of the loop is that `t` test cases have been processed, and for each test case, the output is either 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated, or 'NO' if at least one monster cannot be defeated. The variables `n`, `k`, `healths`, `positions`, `monsters`, `total_bullets_used`, and `success` are reset for each test case, and the loop prints the result for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list of `n` integers `a` (representing the healths of monsters), and a list of `n` distinct integers `x` (representing the positions of monsters). For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to defeat all monsters by shooting them before they reach the player. The function prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated, and 'NO' if at least one monster cannot be defeated. The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been processed and the results have been printed. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the condition used to determine if the player can survive and kill all the monsters. Specifically, the condition `if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:` is incorrect. It should be `if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available * k:` to account for the fact that the player can fire up to `k` bullets per second.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

In this case, the player can indeed survive and kill all the monsters:
- During the 1st second, the player can fire 2 bullets: 1 at the 1st monster and 1 at the 3rd monster. The 1st monster dies, and the 2nd and 3rd monsters move closer.
- During the 2nd second, the player can fire 2 bullets at the 2nd monster, killing it, and the 3rd monster moves closer.
- During the 3rd second, the player can fire 2 bullets at the 3rd monster, killing it.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not correctly account for the number of bullets that can be fired per second.
