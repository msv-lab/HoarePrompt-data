Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (1 â‰¤ \( y \) < \( x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The function `func_1` is designed to achieve this.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 to find the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \).
   - If a divisor \( y \) is found such that \( 2 \times y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \). This is because \( \gcd(x, y) = y \) when \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), and \( y + y = 2y \) is maximized under the condition \( 2y \ge x \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns the largest divisor found, or 1 if no divisors are found (which should only happen if \( x \) is prime).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For prime \( x \), the only divisor less than \( x \) is 1, and \( \gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value for \( y \).

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2y \ge 10 \) is 5, and \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), the only divisor less than 7 is 1, so \( y = 6 \) is returned, and \( \gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 7 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2y \ge 21 \) is 18, and \( \gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 21 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2y \ge 100 \) is 98, and \( \gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2y \ge 1000 \) is 750, and \( \gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2y \ge 6 \) is 3, and \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function correctly identifies the largest divisor \( y \) that satisfies the condition \( 2y \ge x \) when such a divisor exists.
   - For prime numbers and other cases where no such divisor exists, it correctly returns 1, which is the maximum possible value for \( y \) in those scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
