### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `1 \le t \le 1000`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` such that `2 \le n \le 10^6` and `1 \le k \le n`.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence `nums` is initially populated with the first 24 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^23]`.
   - This sequence ensures that any sum from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) can be formed by selecting a subset of these powers of 2.

3. **Modification of Sequence**:
   - The function finds the largest power of 2, \(2^{\text{idx}}\), that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums`.
   - It adds three new elements to `nums`: `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1`.

4. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: There should be no subsequence of `nums` that sums to `k`.
     - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, the sequence ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.
   - **Condition 2**: For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence of `nums` that sums to `v`.
     - The sequence `nums` still contains all other powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), which can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) except for `k`.
     - The addition of `k + 1` and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` ensures that sums greater than `k` can still be formed, and the sequence remains capable of forming all sums from 1 to \(n\) except `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the modified `nums` list, which is always 24.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `nums` that meets the given conditions for each test case. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by a subsequence of `nums`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
