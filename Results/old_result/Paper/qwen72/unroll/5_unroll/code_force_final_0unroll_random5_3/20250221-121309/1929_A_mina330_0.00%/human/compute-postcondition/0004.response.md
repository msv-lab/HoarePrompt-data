Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `ntest` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the input. It then sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list, taken in pairs from the ends towards the center. This sum, `kq`, is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the input variables `ntest` and the list of lists remain unchanged. **
