Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where `t` represents the number of test cases and must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged after the loop execution. **
