The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= x <= 1000. The function returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, provided that there exists a divisor `y` such that 2 * y >= x.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` (2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, if such a divisor `y` exists where 2 * y >= x.**
