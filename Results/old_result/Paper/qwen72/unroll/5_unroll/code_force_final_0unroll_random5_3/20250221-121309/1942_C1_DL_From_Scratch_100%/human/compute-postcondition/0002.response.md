Output State: **The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, sorts the list of chosen vertices, and calculates the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. It then prints this count plus `x - 2` for each iteration. The variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `list0`, and `count` are reset for each iteration, so their final values are not retained after the loop completes. The variable `T` remains unchanged.**
