Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n` correctly.
   - Inside the loop, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the promotion price for two yogurts. The program incorrectly reads `a`, `b`, and `c`, which leads to using the wrong values for calculations.

2. **Variable Naming**:
   - The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are used in the program, but they should be `n`, `a`, and `b` to match the problem description. This mismatch will cause the program to use incorrect values for the calculations.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is intended to be the price of one yogurt if bought in a promotion. However, `c` should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d` is incorrect. It should be checking if the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using the promotion price as much as possible.
     - If the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two yogurts individually, use the promotion price.
     - If there is an odd number of yogurts, buy one yogurt at the regular price.

4. **Output**:
   - The program should print the minimum cost for each test case, but due to the incorrect variable usage and logic, it will not produce the correct output.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The original assessment accurately identified the problems with the program.

Final: **False**
