The function `thing` does not take any parameters, but based on the problem description, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer array `a` of length `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and each element `a_i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99. The function should also handle the number of test cases `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3.
