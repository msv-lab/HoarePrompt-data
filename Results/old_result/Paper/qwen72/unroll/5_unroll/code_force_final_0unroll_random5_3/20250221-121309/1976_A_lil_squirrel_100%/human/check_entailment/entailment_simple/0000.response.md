### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Character Separation:**
   - The program separates the characters in the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase Latin letters and `digits` for digits.
   - This separation is done correctly using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - These checks are necessary to ensure that the letters and digits in the password are sorted as required.

4. **Order of Digits and Letters:**
   - The program iterates through the password to check if any digit appears immediately after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.
   - This check ensures that no digit comes after a letter, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

5. **Final Return:**
   - If the password passes all the checks, the program returns 'YES'.
   - This final return statement is correct and ensures that the password is strong if it meets all the conditions.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It separates the characters, checks the sorting of letters and digits, and ensures that no digit follows a letter. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
