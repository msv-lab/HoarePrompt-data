The function `func` accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `n`. The list `x` has a length between 1 and 500, and each element `x_i` in the list is an integer between 1 and 500. The integer `n` is between 2 and 500 and represents the length of the array `a` that needs to be constructed. The function also handles multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `x` and an integer `n`, and handles multiple test cases indicated by an integer `t`. For each test case, it constructs an array `a` of length `n` and returns the result based on the input parameters. If `t` is provided, the function processes `t` test cases.**
