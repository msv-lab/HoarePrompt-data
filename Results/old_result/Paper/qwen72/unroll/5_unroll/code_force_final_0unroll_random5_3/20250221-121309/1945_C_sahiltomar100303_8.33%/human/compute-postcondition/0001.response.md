The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is a positive integer, which means there is at least one test case to handle.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
