### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The function uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is appropriate because it allows us to efficiently determine how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Triangle Formation Logic:**
   - The function then iterates over the counts of each stick length in `num_of_lens`.
   - If a stick length `x` appears at least 3 times (`cnt >= 3`), it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`. This is correct because any three sticks of the same length can form a degenerate triangle, but since the problem specifies non-degenerate triangles, this part is not directly relevant to the problem's constraints.
   - If a stick length `x` appears at least 2 times (`cnt >= 2`), it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and one stick of a different length. This is done by summing the counts of all other stick lengths (`total_sum`) and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length `x` (`math.comb(cnt, 2)`). This is correct because it ensures that the two sticks of the same length are shorter than the third stick, which is a necessary condition for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `res` for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2, as it will not enter the loop where it calculates combinations, and the result will be 0.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where all stick lengths are unique, as it will not enter the loop where it calculates combinations for counts of 2 or more.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The function is efficient enough to handle the constraints, as it processes each test case in linear time relative to the number of sticks `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle from the given stick lengths. The reasoning and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
