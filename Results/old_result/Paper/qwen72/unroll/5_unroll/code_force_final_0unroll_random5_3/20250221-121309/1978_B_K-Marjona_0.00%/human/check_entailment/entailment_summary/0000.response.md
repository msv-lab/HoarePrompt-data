Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Determine `k`**: The function sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`. This is a reasonable choice because:
   - If `b <= a`, then `b - a` is non-positive, so `k` will be 0, meaning no buns are sold at the modified price.
   - If `b > a`, then `k` is set to the minimum of `n` and `b - a`, ensuring that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the range of modified prices.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, the function prints `a * n`, which is correct because selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit.
   - If `b > a`, the function calculates the profit using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`:
     - The term `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` calculates the sum of the first `k` modified prices. This is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
     - The term `(n - k) * a` calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

4. **Arithmetic Series Sum**: The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is correct for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series with the first term `b` and the last term `b - k + 1`. This is because the sum of an arithmetic series is given by `(first_term + last_term) / 2 * number_of_terms`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `b <= a`, the function correctly prints `a * n`.
   - When `b > a`, the function correctly calculates the profit using the derived formula.

6. **Efficiency**: The function is efficient and handles the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
