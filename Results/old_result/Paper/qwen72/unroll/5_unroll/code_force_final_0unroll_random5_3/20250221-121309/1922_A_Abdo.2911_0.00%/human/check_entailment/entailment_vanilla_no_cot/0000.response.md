Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The template is constructed such that if `a[i] == b[i]`, the template takes the value of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template takes the value of `a[i].upper()`.
   - This construction is not always correct. For example, if `a[i] = 'a'` and `b[i] = 'b'`, the template will have `'A'` at that position. However, this does not guarantee that `c[i]` will not match the template, as `c[i]` could be `'a'` or `'b'`.

2. **Matching Logic**:
   - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template is incorrect. It checks if the template is lowercase and if `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from the template, which is not the correct condition.
   - Similarly, the logic for checking if `c` does not match the template is incorrect. It checks if the template is lowercase and if `c[i]` is different from the template, which is not the correct condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that:
- For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]`, the template must have `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) at that position.
- If `a[i] != b[i]`, the template must have an uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- The string `c` must not match the template, meaning there must be at least one position `i` where `c[i]` either matches the lowercase template or is the lowercase version of an uppercase template.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Check if a and b can have a common template
        template_possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if a[i] == c[i]:
                    template_possible = False
                    break
            else:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    template_possible = False
                    break
        
        if template_possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Template Possibility Check**:
  - If `a[i] == b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) to ensure `c` does not match the template.
  - If `a[i] != b[i]`, then `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]` to ensure `c` does not match the template.
- **Output**:
  - If the template is possible, print 'YES'.
  - Otherwise, print 'NO'.

This corrected approach ensures that the conditions for the template are correctly checked and the output is accurate.
