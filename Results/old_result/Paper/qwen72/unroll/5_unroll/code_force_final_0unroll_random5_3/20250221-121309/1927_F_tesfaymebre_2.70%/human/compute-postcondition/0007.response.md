Output State: **The loop iterates through all neighbors (`nei`) of the current vertex (`curr`). For each neighbor, if the neighbor has not been fully processed (`colors[nei] != 2`) and is not the parent vertex (`nei != parent`), the `dfs` function is called with the neighbor as the new current vertex, `curr` as the new parent, and the current path appended with `nei`. If the result of the `dfs` call (`res`) is not empty and contains `node_v`, the loop returns `res`. If no such `res` is found, the loop completes, and the state of `curr`, `parent`, `path`, and `colors[curr]` is now `2`.**
