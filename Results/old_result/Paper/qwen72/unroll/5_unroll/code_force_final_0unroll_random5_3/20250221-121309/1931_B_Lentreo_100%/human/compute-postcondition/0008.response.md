Output State: **`curr` is 0, `n` and `mean` remain unchanged, `total` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`. In each iteration, it adds the difference between the current element and the mean of the list to `curr`. Since the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of the list, the mean is an integer, and the total sum of the differences between each element and the mean over all elements is zero. Therefore, after all iterations, `curr` will be 0. The values of `n`, `mean`, and `total` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
