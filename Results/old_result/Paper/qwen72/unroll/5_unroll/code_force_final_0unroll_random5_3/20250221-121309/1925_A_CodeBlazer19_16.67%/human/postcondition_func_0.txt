The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) from the input. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26). If `k` is 1, it prints a string consisting of `n` times the character 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the English alphabet, repeated twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it is repeated once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the output.
