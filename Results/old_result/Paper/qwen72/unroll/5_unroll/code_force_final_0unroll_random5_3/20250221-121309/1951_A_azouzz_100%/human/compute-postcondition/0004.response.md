Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It then checks the string `s` for the count of '1' characters and the presence of the substring '11'. Based on these conditions, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The function does not modify any variables outside the loop and does not interact with the file system or subfolders. **
