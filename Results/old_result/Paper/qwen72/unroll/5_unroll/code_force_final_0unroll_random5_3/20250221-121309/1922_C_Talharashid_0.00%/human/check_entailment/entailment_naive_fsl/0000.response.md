Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are located in such a way that the closest city is unique for every city, but the logic for finding the minimum cost to travel between cities is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel from one city to another in all cases.

**Case where the program fails:**

Consider the following input:

```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

Actual Output:
```
3
8
1
4
13
```

The program fails to correctly compute the minimum number of coins required for the last query (5 1). The expected minimum cost is 14 coins, but the program outputs 13 coins. This is because the program does not correctly handle the cost calculation when the start and end cities are far apart, and it incorrectly assumes that the cost should be the absolute difference between the precomputed costs, which can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should correctly compute the minimum cost by considering both the direct distance and the cost of moving to the closest city step-by-step.
