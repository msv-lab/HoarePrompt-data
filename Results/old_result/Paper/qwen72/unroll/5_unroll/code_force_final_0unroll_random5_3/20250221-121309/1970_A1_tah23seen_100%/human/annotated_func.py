#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: d is a dictionary where the keys are integers from 0 to n (inclusive) and the values represent the depth of the parentheses at each position, starting from 0. The value at key 0 is 0, and the value at key n is 0 because the string s is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is now a string that contains the characters from the balanced parentheses sequence `s`, rearranged according to the sorted order of the list `d`. The characters are first sorted by the depth of the parentheses in ascending order, and then by their original positions in descending order.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains the characters from the balanced parentheses sequence `s`, rearranged according to the sorted order of the list `d`. The characters are first sorted by the depth of the parentheses in ascending order, and then by their original positions in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` rearranged by their depth in ascending order and by their original positions in descending order. The input `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000. After the function concludes, the dictionary `d` is no longer in its original state and has been modified to store the depth of parentheses at each position, and `ans` contains the rearranged string.
