Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and the path is a string of n characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', and the first character is '.'. The variable `ret` will be the number of '@' characters encountered in the string `s` before two consecutive '*' characters are found, and `thorn` will be 0 or 1 depending on whether the last character processed was '*' or not.**
