Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        
        list1 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = input('')
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        list1.sort()
        
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        
        out.append(sum(list2))
        
        del list1[:]
        
        del list2[:]
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is the last input integer read in the loop, `num` is the input string, `out` is a list of `int(num)` integers where each integer is the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from the corresponding input list.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The loop prints each integer in the list `out`, which contains `int(num)` integers. Each integer in `out` is the sum of the first `n` sorted integers from the corresponding input list. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `num` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `num` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a space-separated list of integers `b`. It then sorts the list `b`, selects the first `a` integers, and appends their sum to a list `out`. After processing all test cases, it prints each integer in `out`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `num` is the input string, `a` is the last input integer read in the loop, and `out` is a list of `int(num)` integers where each integer is the sum of the first `a` sorted integers from the corresponding input list. The values of `t` and `n` are not used or modified by the function.
