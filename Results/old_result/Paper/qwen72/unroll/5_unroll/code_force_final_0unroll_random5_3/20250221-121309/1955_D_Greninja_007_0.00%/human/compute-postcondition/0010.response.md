The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, and `m`. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, and each element in `a` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6. `b` is a list of `m` integers, where `1 <= m <= n`, and each element in `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6. `k` is an integer in the range `1 <= k <= m`. `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `m` is the length of the list `b`.

The function returns the number of good subarrays. A good subarray is defined as a subarray of length `m` in the list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the subarray and the corresponding frequency in `b` (for integers present in both) is greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and three integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer (present in both the subarray and `b`) is greater than or equal to `k`.**
