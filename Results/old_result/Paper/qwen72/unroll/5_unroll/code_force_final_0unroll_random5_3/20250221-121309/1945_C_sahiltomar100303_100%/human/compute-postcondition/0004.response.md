Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it calculates and prints the optimal division point between the left and right sides of the houses, which minimizes the absolute difference between the number of residents on each side who want to live on the left ('0') or right ('1') side. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the optimal division point for each case, and the internal variables are reset for the next test case. **
