The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and the typical structure of such functions, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters to handle the test cases. Specifically, it seems to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.
