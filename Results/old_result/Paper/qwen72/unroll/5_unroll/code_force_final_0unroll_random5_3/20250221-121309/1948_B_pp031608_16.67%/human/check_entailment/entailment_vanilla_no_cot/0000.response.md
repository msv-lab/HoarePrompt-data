Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list is already sorted. However, it is called before and after the transformation, which is not the correct approach. The transformation should be applied to the list, and then the sorted check should be performed.

2. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The transformation logic is applied only once for each element in the list. This means that if the array requires multiple transformations to become sorted, the program will not handle it correctly.
   - The transformation logic is also applied in a way that assumes the list is already partially sorted, which is not always the case.

3. **Early Termination**:
   - The program terminates the transformation loop as soon as it finds an element that is not in the correct position and is greater than 10. This is incorrect because multiple elements might need to be transformed to achieve a sorted array.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:

1. **Check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the transformation**:
   - Apply the transformation to any element that is greater than or equal to 10.
   - After each transformation, check if the array is sorted.
   - If the array becomes sorted, print 'Yes'.
   - If no more transformations are possible and the array is still not sorted, print 'No'.

### Example of a Correct Solution:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while True:
        transformed = False
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] >= 10:
                transformed = True
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(a[i])]
                a.pop(i)
                a[i:i] = digits
                break
        if not transformed:
            break
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **`can_be_sorted` Function**:
   - This function repeatedly applies the transformation to any element that is greater than or equal to 10.
   - It checks if the array is sorted after each transformation.
   - If no more transformations are needed and the array is sorted, it returns `True`.
   - If no more transformations are needed and the array is not sorted, it returns `False`.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - For each test case, it reads the input, applies the `can_be_sorted` function, and prints the result.

This approach ensures that the array is transformed correctly and checked for sorting after each transformation, leading to the correct output for each test case.
