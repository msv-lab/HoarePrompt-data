Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. `loop` is an input integer. Each test case contains an integer n where 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. a=1 means k must be greater than or equal to x, a=2 means k must be less than or equal to x, and a=3 means k must be not equal to x. It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.**
