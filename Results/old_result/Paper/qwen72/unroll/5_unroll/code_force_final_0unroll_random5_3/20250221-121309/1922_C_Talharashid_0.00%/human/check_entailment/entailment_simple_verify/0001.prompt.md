You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) cities with coordinates a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, and m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries. Each query is a pair of integers x_i, y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i), representing the cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.

    #State: The loop has processed all test cases, and for each query, it has printed the minimum travel cost between the cities x_i and y_i. The variables `t`, `n`, `lst`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `d1`, and `d2` have been updated and used within the loop, but their final values are not retained for the next test case. The loop ends after processing all queries for all test cases, and the program is ready to terminate or accept new input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `lst`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the cumulative cost of traveling from the first city to the last city and from the last city to the first city, respectively.
   - It calculates the minimum distance to the next or previous city using a loop and updates the cumulative cost in the dictionaries.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the start and end cities, adjusts them to zero-based indexing, and calculates the minimum cost using the precomputed cumulative costs in `d1` and `d2`.
   - It prints the minimum cost between the two possible paths (from start to end and from end to start).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cumulative Cost Calculation**:
  - The program uses a loop to calculate the cumulative cost from the first city to the last city (`d1`) and from the last city to the first city (`d2`).
  - It correctly identifies the closest city by comparing the distances to the next and previous cities.
  - The cumulative cost is updated by adding 1 coin if the closest city is chosen, or the actual distance if the closest city is not chosen.

- **Query Processing**:
  - For each query, the program calculates the cost of traveling from the start city to the end city using the precomputed cumulative costs.
  - It correctly handles the case where the start city is greater than the end city by swapping the roles of `d1` and `d2`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program assumes that the closest city is unique for each city, which is a given constraint in the problem.
  - It correctly handles the edge cases where the start or end city is at the boundary of the list.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program efficiently precomputes the cumulative costs in O(n) time for each test case.
  - Each query is processed in O(1) time using the precomputed costs.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost for each query using precomputed cumulative costs and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
