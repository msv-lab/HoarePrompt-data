Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It only defines functions to read inputs, but it does not contain any logic to perform the required operations (swapping elements to prepare for binary search) or to execute the binary search itself. The program needs to include the logic to handle the permutation, perform the necessary swaps, and then apply the binary search to find the position of `x`. The current program is incomplete and does not address the problem requirements.
