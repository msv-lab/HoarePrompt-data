The function `func` accepts parameters for multiple test cases. Each test case includes a list of city coordinates in ascending order and a list of queries. The city coordinates are integers, and each query is a pair of integers representing the indices of two cities between which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The function returns the minimum travel cost for each query.

- **Parameters**:
  - `t`: An integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
  - For each test case:
    - `n`: An integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of cities.
    - `a`: A list of integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order.
    - `m`: An integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) representing the number of queries.
    - `queries`: A list of pairs of integers (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i) representing the queries.

- **Return**:
  - For each query, the function returns the minimum travel cost between the cities specified by the query indices.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it takes the number of cities `n`, a list of city coordinates `a` in ascending order, the number of queries `m`, and a list of queries `queries`. For each query, the function returns the minimum travel cost between the specified cities.**
