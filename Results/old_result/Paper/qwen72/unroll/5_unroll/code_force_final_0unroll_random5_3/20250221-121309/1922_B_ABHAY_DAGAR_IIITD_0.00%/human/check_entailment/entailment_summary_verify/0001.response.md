### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and calls the function `func_1` with `t` as an argument.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `num_list`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Counting Triangles**:
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and adds it to `res`. This is correct because the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths \(2^a\) is if all three sticks have the same length.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, and adds it to `res`. This is incorrect because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than a larger power of 2, so this combination cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.
     - It updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Triangle Inequality**:
  - For three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^b \leq 2^c\) if \(a \leq b < c\).

- **Combinatorial Calculations**:
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \cdot (cnt - 1) \cdot (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
  - However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. This is because such a combination cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 or 2 by correctly not adding any triangles to the result.
  - It also handles the case where all sticks have different lengths by correctly not forming any triangles.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles using the given sticks when all three sticks have the same length. However, it incorrectly includes combinations of 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle.
