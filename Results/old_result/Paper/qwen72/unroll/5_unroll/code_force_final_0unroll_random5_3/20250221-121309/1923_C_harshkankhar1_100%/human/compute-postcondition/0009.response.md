Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`, then reads the array `c`. It computes two cumulative sum lists `a` and `b`. The list `a` contains the cumulative sums of the original array `c`, while the list `b` contains cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. For each query, it checks if the difference in cumulative sums between the specified subarray in `a` is less than the difference in cumulative sums in `b` for the same subarray, or if the subarray is a single element. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any values, but it prints the results of the queries directly. **
