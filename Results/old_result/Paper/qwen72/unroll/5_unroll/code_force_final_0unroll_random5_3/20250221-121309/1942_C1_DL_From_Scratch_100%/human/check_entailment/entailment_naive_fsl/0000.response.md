Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not consecutive and the gaps between them are larger than 1. The program only counts the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices and adds `x - 2` to the count. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of forming triangles with larger gaps.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8 4 0
1 3 5 7
```
The expected output is 4, as you can form 4 non-intersecting triangular pieces by connecting the vertices as follows:
- Triangle 1: (1, 3, 8)
- Triangle 2: (3, 5, 8)
- Triangle 3: (5, 7, 8)
- Triangle 4: (7, 1, 8)

However, the program will output 2, which is incorrect. The program only counts the gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices and adds `x - 2` to the count, leading to an incorrect result.
