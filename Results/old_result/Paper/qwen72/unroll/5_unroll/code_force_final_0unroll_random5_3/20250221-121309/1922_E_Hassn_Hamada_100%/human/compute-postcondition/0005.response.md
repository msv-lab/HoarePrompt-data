To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables:**
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `max(sequence, default=0)` is the start value of the range.
   - `-1` is the stop value of the range.
   - `-1` is the step value of the range.

2. **Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the start value of the range is greater than the stop value.
   - The start value is `max(sequence, default=0)`, which means the maximum value in the `sequence` list, or 0 if the list is empty.
   - The stop value is `-1`.
   - The step value is `-1`, meaning the loop will decrement `i` from the start value to the stop value.

3. **State Adjustments:**
   - For the loop to execute, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than `-1`.
   - If `sequence` is empty, `max(sequence, default=0)` will be 0, which is greater than `-1`, so the loop will execute at least once.
   - If `sequence` is not empty, the maximum value in `sequence` must be greater than `-1`.

4. **Initial State:**
   - `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18.
   - `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
   - `size_overlap` is (0, 0).

### Adjusted State:
- The loop will execute if `max(sequence, default=0)` is greater than `-1`.
- Since `max(sequence, default=0)` is already greater than `-1` (either because the list is empty or because it contains at least one element greater than `-1`), no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop executes.

### Final State:
State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`**

This state ensures that the loop will execute at least once, as `max(sequence, default=0)` is always greater than `-1`.
