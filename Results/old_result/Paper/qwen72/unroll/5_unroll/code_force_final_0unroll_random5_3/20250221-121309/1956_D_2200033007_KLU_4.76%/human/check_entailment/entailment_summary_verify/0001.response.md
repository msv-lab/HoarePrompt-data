Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a string of space-separated integers, splits the string into individual elements, and appends them to the list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take one parameter `c`, which is the length of the array.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints the output `13 0`. This is the correct output for the specific case where the array is `[1, 3, 9]` because the sum of the elements is already `13` and no operations are needed.

4. **Output**:
   - For `c == 2`, the output `4 1` and `1 2` is correct because the MEX of the array `[0, 1]` is `2`, and setting both elements to `2` results in the array `[2, 2]` with a sum of `4`.
   - For `c != 2`, the output `13 0` is only correct for the specific case where the array is `[1, 3, 9]`. However, the function does not handle other lengths (e.g., 1, 4, 5, etc.) or other specific arrays of length 3.

5. **General Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX for the array or perform the operations to maximize the sum for arrays of other lengths. It only handles the specific cases where the length is 2 or the array is `[1, 3, 9]`.
   - For other lengths and arrays, the function will always print `13 0`, which is incorrect. For example, for an array of length 4 like `[1, 100, 2, 1]`, the correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`, but the function will print `13 0`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` is not general enough to handle all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.
   - The program fails to solve the problem for arrays of lengths other than 2 and for arrays of length 3 that are not `[1, 3, 9]`.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program is **incorrect** because it does not solve the problem for all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Final: **False**
