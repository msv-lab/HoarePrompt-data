Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and a list of integers n representing the largest number for each test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to accept the correct parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and n_list is a list of integers where each integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) represents the largest number for each test case.**
