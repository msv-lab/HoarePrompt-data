### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed.
   - It also initializes two indices `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as both `i` and `j` are less than `n`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be adjusted:
     - The program removes the last element from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
     - It then inserts the expected difficulty `b[j]` at the current position `i` in the array `a`.
     - The counter `cnt` is incremented, and the index `j` is moved to the next expected difficulty.
   - If `b[j] >= a[i]`, it means the current problem is within the expected difficulty, so both indices `i` and `j` are incremented.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the number of new problems proposed.

5. **Function `func_1` (Unused):**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used in the program. This function sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the insertion and deletion of elements in the array `a` to ensure that the difficulties are non-decreasing.
- The logic of comparing `b[j]` with `a[i]` and adjusting `a` accordingly is sound.
- However, there is a potential issue with the way the array `a` is modified:
  - The program uses `a.pop(-1)` to remove the last element and then inserts `b[j]` at the current position `i`.
  - This approach does not maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` after each insertion, which is a requirement of the problem.

### Correct Solution:
To maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` after each insertion, the program should use a more efficient method to insert the new difficulty. One way to do this is to use a binary search to find the correct position for the new difficulty and then insert it.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because it does not maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` after each insertion, which is a critical requirement of the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
