Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in `func_1`, which is supposed to determine if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix. However, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a way to split the array into two parts such that swapping these parts results in a non-decreasing array. This involves more than just checking if the array is already sorted.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Check if the array is already sorted:** If the array is already sorted, return "Yes".
2. **Find the point of discontinuity:** Identify the first position where the array is not sorted.
3. **Check if the array can be split and swapped to become sorted:**
   - Split the array into two parts at the point of discontinuity.
   - Concatenate the suffix and the prefix to form a new array.
   - Check if the new array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Corrected Function:

```python
def can_become_sorted(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Find the point of discontinuity
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Split the array at this point and swap
            prefix = arr[:i + 1]
            suffix = arr[i + 1:]
            new_arr = suffix + prefix
            # Check if the new array is sorted
            if all(new_arr[j] <= new_arr[j + 1] for j in range(n - 1)):
                return 'Yes'
            break  # No need to check further if we found the first discontinuity
    
    # If no valid split was found, return 'No'
    return 'No'

# Function to read input and process multiple test cases
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = can_become_sorted(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Function:

1. **Initial Check:** The function first checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it returns "Yes".
2. **Finding Discontinuity:** It then iterates through the array to find the first position where the array is not sorted.
3. **Swapping and Checking:** Once the discontinuity is found, it splits the array into a prefix and a suffix, swaps them, and checks if the new array is sorted.
4. **Final Result:** If the new array is sorted, it returns "Yes". Otherwise, it returns "No".

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines if the array can be sorted by swapping a prefix and a suffix.
