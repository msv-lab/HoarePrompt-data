### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses `func_1` and `func_2` to read input. `func_1` reads a single integer, and `func_2` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to parse the input for the number of test cases, the values of `n` and `k`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The function `func_3` is responsible for calculating Alice's profit. It takes two arguments: `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - `sec_arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference `b_i - a_i` for each item. This difference represents the potential profit Alice can make from each item if Bob buys it.
   - `main_ar` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the difference `b_i - a_i` and the original `b_i` for each item. This is used to determine the optimal items Alice should buy and sell to Bob.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` initializes `sub_summ` to 0, which will store the total profit.
   - It first adds the sum of all `a_i` values (the cost Alice incurs for buying the items) to `sub_summ`.
   - Then, it iterates over `main_ar` and adds the profit from each item to `sub_summ` if the profit (`b_i - a_i`) is non-negative. This ensures that Alice only buys items that can potentially give her a profit.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice's strategy is to maximize her profit, so she should buy items where `b_i - a_i` is non-negative.
   - Bob's strategy is to minimize Alice's profit, so he will take the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values for free. This is because these items have the highest potential profit for Alice, and Bob wants to reduce that profit.

5. **Heap Usage:**
   - The program uses a heap to efficiently find the `k` items with the highest `b_i - a_i` values. This is a good approach because it allows for quick selection of the top `k` items.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning Bob takes no items for free. In this case, Alice can buy and sell all items with non-negative profit.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning Bob takes all items for free. In this case, Alice's profit will be 0 because Bob will take all items she buys.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to read input, but they rely on a global function `putin()`, which is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical issue that would cause the program to fail if `putin()` is not defined elsewhere in the code.

- **Logic and Calculation:**
  - The logic in `func_3` is not entirely correct. It adds the sum of all `a_i` values to `sub_summ` and then adds the profit from items with non-negative `b_i - a_i` values. However, it does not account for Bob's strategy of taking the `k` items with the highest profit for free.
  - The correct approach should involve sorting the items by their profit (`b_i - a_i`) and then calculating the profit based on the top `k` items that Bob will take for free.

### Correctness:
- The program as provided is **incorrect** because it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Additionally, the input parsing function `putin()` is not defined, which would cause the program to fail.

### Correctness: **False**
