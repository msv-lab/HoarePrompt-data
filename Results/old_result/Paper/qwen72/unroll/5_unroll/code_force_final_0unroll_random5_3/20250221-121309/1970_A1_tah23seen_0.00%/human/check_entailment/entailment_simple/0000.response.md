**Reasoning:**

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly takes the input string `s` and passes it to `func_1`.

2. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a dictionary `d` to store the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position.
   - The balance is calculated correctly by iterating through the string `s` and updating the balance based on whether the character is an opening or closing parenthesis.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is unnecessary because the balance at the end of the sequence should be 0, which is already handled by the initial balance calculation.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted by the balance values in increasing order, and in case of ties, by the positions in decreasing order. This is done using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])`.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from `s` in the order determined by the sorted dictionary `d`.
   - However, the program incorrectly uses the indices from the sorted dictionary to access characters in `s`. The indices in the dictionary are 1-based, while string indexing in Python is 0-based. This will lead to incorrect results.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the constructed string `ans`.

**Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses 1-based indices to access a 0-based string, which will result in an `IndexError` or incorrect characters being appended to the result string. The indices in the dictionary should be adjusted to 0-based before being used to construct the result string.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    # Adjust the indices to 0-based
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i - 1]
        
    return ans
```

In this corrected version, the indices are adjusted to 0-based by using `i - 1` when accessing characters in the string `s`. Additionally, the sorting key is adjusted to ensure that ties are broken in decreasing order of position.
