You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and a list of integers n representing the largest number for each test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5).

    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf

    #State: `values` is a list where `values[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for all `i` in the range 1 to 200000, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: The list `values` remains unchanged, and `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `value` for each input `value` provided, where `value` is an integer read from the input for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes an array `values` of size `inf` (200,001) to store the cumulative sum of the digit sums for each integer from 0 to 200,000.
   - It then iterates through each integer from 1 to 200,000, calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` array with the cumulative sum.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum of digit sums up to `n` from the `values` array.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - The digit sum calculation is done by converting the integer to a string and summing the integer values of its characters. This is a correct and efficient way to compute the sum of digits.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step is done in O(inf) time, which is feasible given the constraints (200,000).
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed value from the `values` array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as `n = 1`, `n = 2`, and `n = 3` by precomputing the values and storing them in the `values` array.
   - It also handles the upper limit `n = 200,000` and other large values within the given constraints.

6. **Input and Output**:
   - The program follows the input and output format specified in the problem description.

Since the program meets all the requirements and handles all potential cases correctly, it is considered correct.
