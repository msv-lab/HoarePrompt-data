You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle the input and output as described in the problem statement. It should take an integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) as input and return either -1 if no such array exists, or a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the array, followed by a list of `n` integers, each in the range [-10^9, 10^9], that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop will execute for each input value `x` provided. For each `x`, it will print the number of elements in the array `ans` and then the elements of the array `ans` in reverse order. The array `ans` will contain integers that are either the maximum value starting from 100000000 and decreasing by 1 for each even `x`, or the minimum value starting from -100000000 and increasing by 1 for each odd `x`. The loop will continue until `x` becomes 1. After all iterations, the variables `max` and `min` will be updated based on the number of even and odd operations performed, respectively, and `ans` will be reset for each new input `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `X` and returns either -1 if no such array exists, or a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
