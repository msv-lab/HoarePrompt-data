### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Looping:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `a` and the array `b` itself.

2. **Operation Logic:**
   - The function attempts to reduce the elements of the array `b` to zero by performing the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) and decrementing `b[i-1]` by 1, `b[i]` by 2, and `b[i+1]` by 1.
   - The function iterates through the array from the beginning to the second-to-last element, applying the operation to each element.

3. **Checking Non-Negative Elements:**
   - During the iteration, it checks if any element becomes negative. If so, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without any element becoming negative, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero.

4. **Final Check:**
   - If the last two elements are zero, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the last two elements are not zero, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- **Variable Naming:**
  - The variable `a` is used to store the length of the array, but it is also used in the problem statement to refer to the array itself. This can be confusing. It would be better to use a different variable name for the length, such as `n`.

- **Operation Application:**
  - The operation is applied in a way that might not be correct. Specifically, the line `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` are not consistent with the problem's operation description.
  - The correct operation should be:
    - `b[i - 1] -= 1`
    - `b[i] -= 2`
    - `b[i + 1] -= 1`
  - However, the function is applying the operation in a different manner, which might not achieve the desired result.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the initial values might not allow the operation to be applied correctly.

### Corrected Logic:
- The correct approach would be to check if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 3 and if the array can be reduced to zero without any element becoming negative.
- The function should iterate through the array and apply the operation correctly, ensuring that no element becomes negative.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the described operation and has logical issues that prevent it from solving the problem as intended.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly handle the operations and checks required to determine if the array can be reduced to zero.
