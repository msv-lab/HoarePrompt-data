### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `c`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal. If so, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if all elements are the same, the maximum difference `D` is indeed `0`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order. This is a good strategy because it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.

4. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the program calculates the maximum difference between this element and the largest and smallest elements in `c`. This is correct because for a single element, the maximum difference is indeed the maximum of the differences with the largest and smallest elements in `c`.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program initializes indices `i` and `j` to `0` and `1` respectively, and a variable `ans` to `0` to store the total difference.
   - It iterates through the elements of `a` and calculates the differences `t1` and `t2`:
     - `t1` is the difference between the current element in `a` and the current element in `c` (both starting from the beginning).
     - `t2` is the difference between the current element in `a` (starting from the end) and the current element in `c` (starting from the end).
   - It then updates the indices based on which difference is larger and adds the larger difference to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The sorting step ensures that the largest elements in `c` are paired with the smallest elements in `a` and vice versa, which maximizes the differences.
- The logic for handling the single element case is correct.
- The general case logic is also correct as it ensures that the maximum possible differences are added to `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
