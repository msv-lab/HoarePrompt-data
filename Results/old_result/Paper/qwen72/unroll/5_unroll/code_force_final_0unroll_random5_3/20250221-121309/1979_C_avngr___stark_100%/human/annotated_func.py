#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 1 and b > 1.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are both greater than 1, the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (both greater than 1) and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The input variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers with a length of at least 1.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: result is equal to the final value obtained after applying func_1 sequentially to all elements in the numbers list.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value obtained after applying `func_1` sequentially to all elements in the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of applying the function `func_1` sequentially to all elements in the list. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the returned value is the cumulative result of `func_1` applied to each element in the `numbers` list, starting from the first element.
