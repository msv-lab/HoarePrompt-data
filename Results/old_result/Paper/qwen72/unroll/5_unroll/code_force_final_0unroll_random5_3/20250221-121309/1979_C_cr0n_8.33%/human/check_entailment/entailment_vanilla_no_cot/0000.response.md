Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program is incorrect for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `prod`**:
   - The program calculates `prod` as the product of all `k_i` values. However, this is not necessary for solving the problem. The product of all `k_i` values can be very large, and it is not used correctly in the solution.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `vprod`**:
   - The program calculates `vprod` as `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`. This means that each `x_i` is calculated as the product of all `k_i` values divided by `k_i`. This approach does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Incorrect Check for Denominator**:
   - The program checks if `den` (which is `prod - sum(vprod)`) is less than or equal to 0. This is not the correct condition to check. The condition should be whether the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to set the bets in such a way that the sum of the bets is just slightly less than the minimum possible return.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
cases = int(input())
for _ in range(cases):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    total = sum(1 / (k - 1) for k in vals)
    if total >= 1:
        print(-1)
        return
    bets = [1 // (1 - total * (k - 1)) for k in vals]
    print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Calculate the Total**:
   - The total sum of `1 / (k_i - 1)` for all `k_i` is calculated. If this sum is greater than or equal to 1, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. In this case, the program outputs `-1`.

2. **Calculate the Bets**:
   - If the total sum is less than 1, the program calculates the bets `x_i` as `1 // (1 - total * (k_i - 1))`. This ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the problem constraints and outputs valid bets or `-1` when no solution exists.
