The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the specified parameters and return a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not detailed.
