Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), after potentially rearranging the elements of the array. The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, the array should be sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array will be minimized, and the sum of these differences will be maximized.

- **Function `func_1`**: This function sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, the problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. The use of `abs` in the function is incorrect because it will always return a non-negative sum, which is not what the problem requires. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the differences directly without taking the absolute value.

- **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, processes it to extract multiple arrays, and applies `func_1` to each array. The input processing and the application of `func_1` are correct. However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall program will not produce the correct output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem.

Correctness: **False**
