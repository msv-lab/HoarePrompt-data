Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal but can work if the function is designed to read inputs directly from `stdin`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Logic for Checking Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous element.
   - If it finds an element that is less than the previous one, it splits the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the digits of the element are not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the digits are sorted, it replaces the previous element with the first digit of the split list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing the array, it prints 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing by the operations, and 'NO' otherwise.

4. **Issues and Corrections**:
   - The function should accept the number of test cases `t` as a parameter to match the problem description.
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing is flawed. The function should check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements, not just by replacing the previous element with its first digit.
   - The function should handle the case where the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements at multiple positions, not just one.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - For each test case, the function should check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting any element that is at least 10.
   - This involves simulating the splitting operation and checking if the resulting array is non-decreasing.
   - If the array can be made non-decreasing by any sequence of such operations, it should print 'YES'; otherwise, 'NO'.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The function does not handle the splitting operation correctly and does not check all possible sequences of operations.

Correctness: **False**
