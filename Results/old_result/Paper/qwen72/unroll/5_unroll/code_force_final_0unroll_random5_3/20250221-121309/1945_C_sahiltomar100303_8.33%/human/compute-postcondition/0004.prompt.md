You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed the optimal boundary index (left or right) that balances the number of '0's and '1's as close to the middle as possible, given the constraints. The variables `t`, `n`, `s`, `mid`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightOne`, `left`, `leftMove`, and `right` will have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values will depend on the specific inputs provided for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the minimum number of swaps required to arrange all '0's to the left of all '1's for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
