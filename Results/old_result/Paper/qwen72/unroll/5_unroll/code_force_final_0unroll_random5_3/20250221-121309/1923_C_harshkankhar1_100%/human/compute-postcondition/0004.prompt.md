Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The number of test cases `t` remains between 1 and 10^4. For the current test case, `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries, both of which are integers provided by the user and are within the range 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5. The elements of the array `c` and the queries are yet to be defined. `a` is a list of integers starting with 0, followed by the integers provided by the user. `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
    b[i] = b[i - 1] + x


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
