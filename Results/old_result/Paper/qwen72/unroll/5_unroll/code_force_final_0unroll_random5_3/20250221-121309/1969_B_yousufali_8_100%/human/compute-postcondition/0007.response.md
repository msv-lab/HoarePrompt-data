Functionality: ** The function reads a binary string `s` from the standard input, processes it to calculate a value `ans` based on the number of '1's and '0's in the string, and prints the result. Specifically, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1', where `n` is the count of '1's encountered before the '0'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `s` remains the same binary string input by the user, and `ans` is the printed result. **
