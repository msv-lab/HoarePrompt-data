Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It parses the initial field state, correctly identifying players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - The middle of the field is correctly calculated and stored in `middle`.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function is used to handle the movement of players. It correctly updates the position of a player based on the direction of movement.
   - However, the `mouvements` dictionary is defined with incorrect values for the direction changes. For example, moving left should decrease the x-coordinate, and moving up should decrease the y-coordinate. The current implementation does not reflect this correctly.

3. **Catching the Quaffle**:
   - The program attempts to handle the catching of the Quaffle with the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`. This is incorrect because it uses a comparison operator `==` instead of an assignment operator `=`. The correct line should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.

4. **Throwing the Quaffle**:
   - The program correctly checks if the player is at a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - It also correctly prints the goal event and resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if the player scores in the correct goal.
   - However, it does not handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal. The program should print the opposite team's goal and update the score accordingly.

5. **Bludger Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated due to the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination event and updates the Quaffle's position if the eliminated player was carrying it.
   - The player is correctly removed from the `players` dictionary.

6. **Final Score**:
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given these points, the program has several critical issues that need to be addressed:

- **Movement Handling**: The `mouvements` dictionary should be corrected to reflect the correct direction changes.
- **Catching the Quaffle**: The assignment operator should be used instead of the comparison operator.
- **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program should handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Parse the initial field state
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [v, '']
                    del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

# Print the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should work correctly according to the problem description.
