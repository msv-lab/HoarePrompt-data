Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that for each \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the list \( a \).

2. **Permutation Construction**:
   - The permutation \( p \) is initialized with \(-1\) for all positions.
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to \( n \), which is the largest possible value for the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of the permutation \( p \).

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the indices of \( p \) in reverse order (from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \)).
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( p_i \) to \( \texttt{mex} - a_i \).
   - It then updates `mex` to the minimum value between the current `mex` and \( p_i \).

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing \( p \) for each test case, it prints the elements of \( p \).

### Verification of the Logic:

- **Initial MEX Value**:
  - The initial value of `mex` is \( n \), which is correct because the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an empty array is \( 0 \), and the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of an array with all elements from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \) is \( n \).

- **Backward Construction**:
  - The program constructs \( p \) in reverse order. This is a valid approach because the \(\texttt{MEX}\) of the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \) can be determined by the elements already placed in \( p \) and the current value of `mex`.
  - For each \( i \), \( p_i \) is set to \( \texttt{mex} - a_i \). This ensures that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
  - The `mex` is updated to the minimum value between the current `mex` and \( p_i \). This is necessary because \( p_i \) is a new element in the permutation, and it might be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the prefix \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i \).

- **Correctness of the Permutation**:
  - The program ensures that \( p \) is a valid permutation by updating `mex` and setting \( p_i \) accordingly.
  - The final state of `mex` will be the minimum value in \( p \), which is consistent with the properties of the \(\texttt{MEX}\) function.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
  - Initial `mex` = 5
  - \( p_4 = 5 - 2 = 3 \)
  - \( p_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
  - \( p_2 = 2 - (-2) = 4 \)
  - \( p_1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \) (but `mex` is updated to 2, so \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \))
  - \( p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
  - Final \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)
  - \( a_0 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \)
  - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 \)
  - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 \)
  - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 \)
  - The constructed \( p \) satisfies the given \( a \).

- **Test Case 2**:
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
  - Initial `mex` = 5
  - \( p_4 = 5 - 1 = 4 \)
  - \( p_3 = 4 - 1 = 3 \)
  - \( p_2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
  - \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
  - \( p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
  - Final \( p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] \)
  - \( a_0 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 \)
  - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1 \)
  - \( a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1 \)
  - \( a_4 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1 \)
  - The constructed \( p \) satisfies the given \( a \).

- **Test Case 3**:
  - \( n = 3 \)
  - \( a = [-2, 1, 2] \)
  - Initial `mex` = 3
  - \( p_2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \)
  - \( p_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
  - \( p_0 = 0 - (-2) = 2 \)
  - Final \( p = [2, 0, 1] \)
  - \( a_0 = \texttt{MEX}(2) - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2 \)
  - \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(2, 0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1 \)
  - \( a_2 = \texttt{MEX}(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
  - The constructed \( p \) satisfies the given \( a \).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \) for each test case. The logic and the implementation are correct.
