### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for handling multiple test cases in competitive programming.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, reading the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.

2. **Counting 'U' Coins:**
   - For each test case, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd. If it is, Alice will win; otherwise, Bob will win.
   - This logic is based on the observation that if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make the first move and force Bob into a position where he will eventually lose. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves and force Alice to lose.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if Alice will win and 'NO' otherwise, which matches the required output format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2.
   - If `n` is 1 and the coin is 'U', Alice wins (since Bob has no move).
   - If `n` is 2 and both coins are 'U', Alice wins (since Bob has no move after Alice's first move).

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the number of facing-up coins. The input parsing and the decision-making process are both sound and align with the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
