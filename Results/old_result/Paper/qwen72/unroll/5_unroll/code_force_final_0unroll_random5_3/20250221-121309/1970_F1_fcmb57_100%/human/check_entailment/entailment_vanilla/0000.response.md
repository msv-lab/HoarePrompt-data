### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes dictionaries for `players` and `goals` and a dictionary for movement directions `mouvements`.
   - It reads the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries based on the characters in the field.

2. **Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the movement of players. It takes the current position of the player and the movement direction, and returns the new position.
   - The function correctly updates the player's position by adding the movement direction to the current position.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `T` and then processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks if the move is a direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), and if so, updates the player's position using `func_1`.
   - If the move is a throw (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team. If so, it updates the score and prints the appropriate goal message.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which should result in the other team scoring a point.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score.

### Issues:
- **Handling Own Goals:**
  - The program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal. According to the problem description, if a red player throws the Quaffle into a red goal, the blue team should score a point, and vice versa. The current implementation only checks if the player is at a goal of the opposite team.

### Correctness:
- **False** because the program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, which is an important part of the problem description.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to add a check for own goals in the `T` (throw) action.

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..' or s[x] == '.Q':
            continue
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        player_pos = players[mo[0]]
        if player_pos in goals['R']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'R':
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            else:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
        elif player_pos in goals['B']:
            if mo[0][0] == 'B':
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            else:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- In the `T` (throw) action, we first get the current position of the player.
- We then check if the player is at a red goal. If so, we further check the team of the player. If the player is from the red team, the blue team scores a point. If the player is from the blue team, the red team scores a point.
- Similarly, we check if the player is at a blue goal. If so, we further check the team of the player. If the player is from the blue team, the red team scores a point. If the player is from the red team, the blue team scores a point.

### Final Correctness:
- **True** after the fix, the program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem, including own goals.
