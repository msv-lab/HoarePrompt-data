### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and 500 is within this range.

2. **Construction of `a` array:**
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\) for \(1 \le i \le n\).
   - This construction ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because:
     - \(a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\)
     - Therefore, \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}\).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) by starting with \(a[0] = 500\) and incrementing by values of \(x_i\) which are at most 500.
   - Since \(x_i \le 500\) and the maximum number of elements in `x` is 500, the maximum value of \(a_i\) will be \(500 + 500 \times 500 = 250500\), which is well within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` for each test case, which satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
