### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - This means for each outcome `i`, the bet `x_i` should satisfy the condition: `x_i * k_i > sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`. The LCM is used to find a common multiple that can be used to distribute the coins.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers. It iteratively applies `func_1` to the list to get the LCM of all elements. The LCM is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers `k` using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the bet on each outcome `i` is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the sum of all bets is less than `m`. If it is, the bets are valid; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k` is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total sum of bets is less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `sum(c) >= m`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins as required, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `k = [3, 2, 7]`
     - LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
     - Bets: `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, `42 // 7 = 6`.
     - Total bets: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
     - Returns: `3 * 14 = 42`, `2 * 21 = 42`, `7 * 6 = 42`.
     - Since `41 < 42`, the bets are valid.
   - **Test Case 2**: `k = [3, 3]`
     - LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
     - Bets: `3 // 3 = 1`, `3 // 3 = 1`.
     - Total bets: `1 + 1 = 2`.
     - Returns: `3 * 1 = 3`, `3 * 1 = 3`.
     - Since `2 < 3`, the bets are valid.
   - **Test Case 3**: `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
     - LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
     - Bets: `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`, `5 // 5 = 1`.
     - Total bets: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
     - Returns: `5 * 1 = 5`, `5 * 1 = 5`, `5 * 1 = 5`, `5 * 1 = 5`, `5 * 1 = 5`.
     - Since `5 == 5`, the bets are not valid, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins as required by the problem. It ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and it handles cases where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.

Correctness: **True**
