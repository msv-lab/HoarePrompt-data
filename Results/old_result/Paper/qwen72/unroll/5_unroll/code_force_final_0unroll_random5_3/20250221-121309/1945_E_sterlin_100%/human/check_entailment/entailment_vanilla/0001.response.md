### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - After the swaps, we need to ensure that the binary search algorithm will find `x` at the correct position.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - The binary search algorithm is described as follows:
     - Initialize `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
     - Loop until `r - l = 1`.
     - Compute `m = (r + l) // 2`.
     - If `p[m] <= x`, set `l = m`.
     - Otherwise, set `r = m`.
   - The goal is to have `p[l] = x` after the loop ends.

3. **Swapping Strategy:**
   - To make the binary search work correctly, we need to ensure that the element `x` is in a position where the binary search will find it.
   - The binary search will find `x` if `x` is in a position `i` such that `p[i] = x` and the elements to the left of `i` are less than or equal to `x`, and the elements to the right of `i` are greater than `x`.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The provided functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input.
   - However, the actual logic for solving the problem is missing. The functions only handle input reading and do not perform any swaps or binary search.

5. **Missing Logic:**
   - The program does not include any logic to determine the positions of `x` and the elements that need to be swapped.
   - The program does not include the binary search algorithm.
   - The program does not output the number of swaps or the indices of the swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as described. It only includes functions for reading input but lacks the necessary logic to perform the required swaps and binary search.

### Correctness:
**False**
