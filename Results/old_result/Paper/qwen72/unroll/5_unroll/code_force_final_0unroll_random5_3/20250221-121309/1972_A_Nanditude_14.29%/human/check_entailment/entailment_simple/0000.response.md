Reasoning:  
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not properly handle the insertion and sorting of the new problem difficulties. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Sorting**:
   - The program attempts to insert `b[j]` into the list `a` at position `i` and then removes the last element of `a`. However, this approach does not ensure that the list `a` remains sorted in non-decreasing order after each insertion and deletion.
   - The correct approach should be to insert a new problem with difficulty `w` (which is not necessarily `b[j]`) into the list `a`, sort `a` in non-decreasing order, and then remove the last element. This ensures that `a` remains sorted correctly after each operation.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if b[j] < a[i]` is not the correct way to determine if a new problem needs to be proposed. Instead, the program should check if `a[i]` is greater than `b[i]` for any `i`. If `a[i] > b[i]`, a new problem with a difficulty less than or equal to `b[i]` should be proposed to replace the most difficult problem in `a`.

3. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. Moreover, the function definition `def func_1(arr):` and its implementation (which sorts the array in non-increasing order) do not align with the problem requirements. The function should not be part of the solution.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the count of new problems proposed, but the logic for determining this count is incorrect. The program should correctly count the number of operations needed to make `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
