### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - A non-degenerate triangle has the property that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of exponents `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent `a_i`. This is efficient and correctly captures the frequency of each stick length.

4. **Triangle Formation Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the counts of each stick length.
   - **Case 1: All sticks have the same length**:
     - If a stick length has a count of 3 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} \). This is correct because any three sticks of the same length will form a degenerate triangle, which is not allowed.
   - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length, and one stick has a different length**:
     - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times \text{total\_sum} \). This is correct because the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks (both \(2^a\)) must be greater than the length of the longest stick (\(2^b\)), which simplifies to \(2^{a+1} > 2^b\) or \(a + 1 > b\). This condition is implicitly satisfied by the program's logic.
   - **Case 3: All three sticks have different lengths**:
     - The program does not explicitly handle this case. However, it is not necessary because the combination of three different stick lengths will not form a non-degenerate triangle due to the exponential nature of the lengths. For example, if the sticks have lengths \(2^a\), \(2^b\), and \(2^c\) (where \(a < b < c\)), the condition \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) will never be satisfied because \(2^c\) will always be greater than the sum of \(2^a\) and \(2^b\).

5. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program uses the `math.comb` function to calculate combinations, which is correct and efficient.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct behavior as specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program correctly handles the cases where the sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
- It efficiently counts the number of valid combinations and prints the results for each test case.
- The logic for counting combinations of sticks with the same and different lengths is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its implementation and logic. It correctly handles all the necessary cases and efficiently computes the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles from the given stick lengths.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
