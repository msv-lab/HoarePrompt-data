Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, `arr` is updated to the value returned by `func_2()`.** 

Explanation: The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_1()`, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The code snippet `arr = func_2()` updates `arr` to the value returned by `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were after being updated by `func_1()`. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.
