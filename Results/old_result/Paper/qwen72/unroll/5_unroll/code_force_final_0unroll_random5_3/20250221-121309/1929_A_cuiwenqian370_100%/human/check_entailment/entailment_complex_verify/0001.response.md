### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment suggests that sorting the array in descending order would maximize the beauty. However, this is incorrect. The problem does not require the differences to be positive; it requires the sum of the absolute differences to be maximized.

3. **Optimal Solution:**
   - The optimal way to maximize the sum of the absolute differences is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the differences. This is because the absolute differences between consecutive elements in a sorted array (whether ascending or descending) will be the same.
   - For example, consider the array \([1, 2, 3]\):
     - Ascending: \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Descending: \((3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 1 + 1 = 2\)
   - The absolute differences are the same in both cases.

4. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(array)` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and then printed one by one.
   - The function is correctly implemented to handle multiple test cases and process the input as described in the problem statement.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order, which is correct for maximizing the sum of the absolute differences.
   - Therefore, the program is correct.
