You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) and generates a list of integers `ans` such that the list has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. It prints the length of the list `t` and then the elements of the list `ans` in reverse order. If no such list can be generated, it does not handle this case and will not return -1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).
   - It initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \( -10^8 \), which are the upper and lower bounds for the elements in the array.
   - It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the array and a counter `t` to keep track of the length of the array.
   - The program enters a loop where it continues to modify \( X \) until \( X \) becomes 1.
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - After the loop, it reverses the list `ans` to ensure the elements are in the correct order.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the array and the array itself.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The program aims to construct an array by appending elements such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \( X \).
   - The approach of appending `max` for even \( X \) and `min` for odd \( X \) is a heuristic to ensure the array can be constructed with the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 correctly. When \( X \) is 1, the program should print 1 and a single element (e.g., 0), but it does not do so.
   - The program also does not handle the case where \( X \) is greater than the maximum number of increasing subsequences that can be generated with an array of length 200. This is a potential issue because the program does not check if \( X \) is feasible.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Handling \( X = 1 \):** The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 1 by printing 1 and a single element.
   - **Feasibility Check:** The program should check if \( X \) is feasible with an array of length 200. If \( X \) is too large, it should print -1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( X \) is 1 and does not check the feasibility of \( X \) with an array of length 200.
