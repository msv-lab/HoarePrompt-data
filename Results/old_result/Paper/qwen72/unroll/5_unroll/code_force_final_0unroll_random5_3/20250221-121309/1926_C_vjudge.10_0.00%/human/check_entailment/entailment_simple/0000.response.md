### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the largest number on the board.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `soma` to 0, which is intended to store the sum of the sums of digits for all test cases.
   - For each test case, it iterates from 0 to `n-1` and adds the result of `func_1(i)` to `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of the integer `n` by converting `n` to a string, iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total sum `soma` after processing all test cases.

5. **Logical Error**:
   - The program accumulates the sum of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it at the end. This is incorrect because the problem requires the sum for each test case to be printed separately.

6. **Performance Consideration**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(t \cdot n)\), where \(t\) is the number of test cases and \(n\) is the largest number in each test case. This can be inefficient for large values of \(t\) and \(n\), especially given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
- The program does not print the sum for each test case separately, which is a requirement of the problem.
- The program accumulates the sum of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it at the end, which is incorrect.
- The time complexity of the program is not optimized for the given constraints, which could lead to performance issues.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The corrected program initializes `soma` to 0 for each test case.
- It iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and calculates the sum of the digits for each number.
- It prints the sum for each test case separately, as required by the problem.
