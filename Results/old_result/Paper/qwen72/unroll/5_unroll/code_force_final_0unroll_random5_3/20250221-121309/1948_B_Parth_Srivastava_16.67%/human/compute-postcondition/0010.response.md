Postcondition: **`t` remains the same, `test_cases` remains the same, `k` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `x` is the last digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the first digit of the last element in `a` if it is greater than 10, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `c`, `c` is a list of integers where each element is either a single-digit number from `a` or a two-digit number from `a` split into its tens and units digits, with the tens digit appended only if it is less than or equal to the units digit and greater than or equal to the last element in `c` (if any), `d` is a sorted version of `c`, and `c` is equal to `d`.**
