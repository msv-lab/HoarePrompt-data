Reasoning:  
The program aims to construct a permutation `p` from the given array `a` such that `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The approach taken by the program is to start from the end of the array and work backwards, which is a valid strategy given the constraints and the nature of the MEX function.

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` values of length `n` and `mex` as `n`.
2. **Backward Calculation**: For each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
   - It calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and `p[i]`.

This approach ensures that `p[i]` is always a valid value (since `mex` is updated to the minimum value found so far, which guarantees that `p[i]` is a non-negative integer and does not exceed `n-1`).

3. **Output**: After constructing `p` for each test case, the program prints the elements of `p`.

The program's logic is consistent with the problem's requirements, and the execution summary confirms that the program processes the input correctly and produces the expected output.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should correctly construct a valid permutation `p` for each test case. The provided execution summary also aligns with the expected behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
