### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The original assessment states that sorting the array in ascending order is not the optimal way to maximize the beauty. However, this is incorrect. The beauty is defined as the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\), not the absolute differences. Therefore, sorting the array in ascending order is actually the correct approach to maximize the beauty.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(array)` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and then printed one by one.
   - This function is correctly implemented and handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

4. **Optimal Solution:**
   - The optimal way to maximize the beauty is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the differences between consecutive elements.
   - This is because the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be positive and maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation in `func_1(array)` sorts the array in ascending order, which is the correct approach to maximize the beauty.
   - Therefore, the program is correct.
