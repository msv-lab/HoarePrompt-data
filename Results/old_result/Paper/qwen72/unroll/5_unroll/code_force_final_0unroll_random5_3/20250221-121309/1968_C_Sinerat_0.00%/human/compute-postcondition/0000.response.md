The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop is controlled by the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer, as the loop will run `int(input())` times. The state of `t` is relevant here because it indicates the number of test cases, which is directly related to the number of times the loop will execute.

Given the constraints, `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer where `1 <= t <= 10^4`**
