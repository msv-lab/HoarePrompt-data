Precondition: **The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n and three strings a, b, and c. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (1, 'a', 'b', 'c'),
    (2, 'aa', 'bb', 'aa'),
    (10, 'mathforces', 'luckforces', 'adhoccoder'),
    (3, 'acc', 'abd', 'abc')
]
```
