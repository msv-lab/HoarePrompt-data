The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used in the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable that will be iterated over the range of `t`**
