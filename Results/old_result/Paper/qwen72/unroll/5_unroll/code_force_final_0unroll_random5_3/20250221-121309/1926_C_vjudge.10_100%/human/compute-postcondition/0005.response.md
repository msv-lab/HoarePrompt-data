The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `values` is a list where `values[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for all `i` in the range 1 to 200000, and `n` remains unchanged. These details are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop execution.

State: **`values` is a list where `values[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i` for all `i` in the range 1 to 200000, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` remains unchanged, `_` is 0**
