The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate a certain number of times. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. 

Since the state before the loop starts mentions that the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, we can infer that `int(input())` is the number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the number of test cases must be at least 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
