Output State: **The loop will print the area of each square (which is the side length squared) for each test case. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the list of test cases will also remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` will be overwritten in each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be those from the last test case.**
