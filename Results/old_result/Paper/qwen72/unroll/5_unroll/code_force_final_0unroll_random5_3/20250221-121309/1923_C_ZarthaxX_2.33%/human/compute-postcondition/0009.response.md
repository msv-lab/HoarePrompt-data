Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array of positive integers. It takes no parameters directly but reads input from the standard input. The function first reads two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`. The function calculates two auxiliary arrays: `ones`, which tracks the cumulative count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum`, which tracks the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `l` and `r` and determines if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) is satisfied, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts and sums within the range `[l, r]` of `nums`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `ones`, `sum`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged, but the function has printed the results of the queries to the standard output. **
