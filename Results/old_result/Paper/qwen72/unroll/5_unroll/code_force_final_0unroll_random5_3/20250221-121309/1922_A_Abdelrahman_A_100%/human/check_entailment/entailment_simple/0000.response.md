### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function checks if `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' because `c` cannot differ from both `a` and `b` if it is identical to one of them. This is a valid and necessary check.

3. **Character Matching:**
   - The function then iterates through each character of `c` and checks if the character at the same position in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`.
   - If any character in `c` does not match the corresponding characters in `a` or `b`, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. This is correct because it means `c` does not match the template, while `a` and `b` do.
   - If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, it prints 'NO' because `c` matches the template.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `c` is identical to either `a` or `b` by immediately printing 'NO'.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `c` has a character that is not present in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`.

5. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The logic for determining if a template exists such that `a` and `b` match it while `c` does not is implemented correctly. The function checks if each character in `c` is different from the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`, which is the correct condition for `c` not matching the template.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The program handles all the given test cases and edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
