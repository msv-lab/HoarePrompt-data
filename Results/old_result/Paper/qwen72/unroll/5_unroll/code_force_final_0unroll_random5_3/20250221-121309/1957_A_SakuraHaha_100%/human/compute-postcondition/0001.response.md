Output State: **The function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists where each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks. The variable `n` is now an input integer. The variable `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.**
