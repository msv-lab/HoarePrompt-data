The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid, respectively. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list `results`, where each element is a string 'YES' or 'NO'. Each element in `results` corresponds to a test case in `test_cases` and indicates whether the second row can be reached from the first row for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` representing arrows in a grid. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the second row can be reached from the first row for the corresponding test case, or 'NO' otherwise.**
