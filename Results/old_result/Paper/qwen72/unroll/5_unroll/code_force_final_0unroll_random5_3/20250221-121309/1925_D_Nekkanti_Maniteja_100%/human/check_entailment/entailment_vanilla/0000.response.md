### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` children, `m` pairs of friends, and `k` excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - For each excursion, the teacher randomly picks a pair of children.
   - If the picked pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of picking a specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair of friends per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the total sum of friendship values per excursion is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The sum of initial friendship values is calculated by summing up all `f_i` for the `m` pairs of friends.

4. **Expected Value Over `k` Excursions:**
   - For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).
   - Over `k` excursions, the total expected increase is \(k \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The result needs to be computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - We need to compute the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) to handle the division in modular arithmetic.

6. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It calculates the modular inverse of \(\binom{n}{2}\) using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.
   - It initializes `a` to store the sum of initial friendship values.
   - It reads the `m` pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing them up in `a`.
   - It initializes `s` to store the cumulative expected value.
   - It iterates over `k` excursions, updating `s` with the expected increase in friendship values.
   - Finally, it prints `s % M`.

### Issues in the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
  - The program incorrectly updates `s` in the loop. The expected increase in the sum of friendship values per excursion should be \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \text{sum of initial friendship values}\).
  - The loop should not multiply `i` by `c` and then `m` by `c` again. This is incorrect and will lead to an incorrect result.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_increase = c * a
        total_expected_value = k * expected_increase
        print(total_expected_value % M)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the way it calculates the expected value over `k` excursions.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the expected increase per excursion and then multiplies it by `k`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
