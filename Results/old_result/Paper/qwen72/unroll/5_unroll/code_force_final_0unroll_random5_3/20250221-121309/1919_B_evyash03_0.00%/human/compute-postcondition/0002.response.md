The only objects in the loop head are the variable `char` and the string `expression`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute. Given that `length` is a positive integer and `length` == len(`expression`), `expression` is guaranteed to be non-empty (since `length` is at least 1). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `expression` to ensure the loop executes.

However, before the loop starts, `char` should be the first character in `expression` to ensure the loop can proceed with its first iteration.

State: **`expression` is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-" only, `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `length` <= 5000 and `length` == len(`expression`), `count` is 0, `balance` is 0, `char` is the first character in `expression`**
