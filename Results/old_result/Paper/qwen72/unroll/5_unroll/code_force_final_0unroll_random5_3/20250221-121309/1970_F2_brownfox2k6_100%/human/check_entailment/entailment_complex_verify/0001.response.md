### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch where two teams (Red and Blue) compete to score points by placing the Quaffle in the opponent's goals.
   - The game is played on a rectangular grid with specific rules for movement, catching, and throwing the Quaffle.
   - Players can be eliminated if they come into contact with a Bludger.
   - The final score and events (goals and eliminations) need to be printed in the correct order.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes the positions of the goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the players.
     - The positions are stored in appropriate data structures (`rg` for red goals, `bg` for blue goals, `ball` for the Quaffle, `blud` for the Bludger, and `player` for the players).

   - **Game Loop:**
     - The program iterates through the actions (T steps) and updates the positions of the entities based on the actions.
     - It correctly handles the movement of the Quaffle, the Bludger, and the players using the `func_1` function.
     - It checks for the catching and throwing of the Quaffle and updates the `carry` variable accordingly.
     - It correctly checks if a player is eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination event using the `func_2` function.
     - It correctly checks if a goal is scored and updates the scores (`rs` for red, `bs` for blue) and prints the goal event.

   - **Final Score:**
     - The program prints the final score at the end of the game in the correct format.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function updates the position of an entity (player or ball) based on the direction given.
   - It correctly handles the four possible directions: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right).
   - The function modifies the position of the entity in place, which is appropriate for the problem.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
   - It correctly identifies and prints the eliminated players in alphabetical order.
   - The function also updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field and reads the actions.
   - The program correctly handles the movement, catching, and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger.
   - The program correctly checks for scoring conditions and prints the appropriate events.
   - The program correctly prints the final score.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code covers all the necessary aspects of the problem.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their specific tasks.
   - The main logic for the game, including scoring, catching the Quaffle, and handling the Quaffle's position after a goal, is correctly implemented.
   - The program prints the final score and the events in the correct format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
