The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the standard input. It then calculates the number of groups of three sticks of the same length that can be formed from the list `a`. The result is printed to the standard output. The function does not accept any parameters, does not return any value, and does not modify any external state.
