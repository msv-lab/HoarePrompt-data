### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of the string representations of the integers.
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each integer using the function `func_1` and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number represented as a string.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the list `zeros` in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of trailing zeros that can be removed in pairs by summing every second element in the sorted list `zeros`.
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the sum of trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the condition `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1` is true, it means that after all possible moves, the remaining number will have at least `m + 1` digits, which means Sasha wins.
   - Otherwise, Anna wins.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The program incorrectly assigns `'Sashah'` to `answers[test]` instead of `'Sasha'`. This is a typo and should be corrected.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the typo is corrected.
- **False** if the typo is not corrected.

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Corrected typo
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in num satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`, and the rest of the list `num` remains unchanged.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`, and the rest of the list `num` remains unchanged.
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the typo in the assignment to `answers[test]`).

If the typo is corrected, the program would be:
Correctness: **True**.
