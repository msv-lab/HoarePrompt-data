Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of sorting the array through the allowed operations, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of data, and applies `func_1` to each set.
   - It correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the results generated by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be sorted by performing the operation of splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix.
   - One way to do this is to find the point where the array is not sorted, split the array at that point, and check if the resulting concatenated array is sorted.
   - For example, if the array is `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, we can split it at the point where `9` is followed by `2`, resulting in `x = [7, 9]` and `y = [2, 2, 3]`. Swapping these parts gives `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`, which is sorted.

Given that `func_1` does not implement the correct logic to check if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
