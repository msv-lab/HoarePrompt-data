### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads an integer \( t \) which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string \( s \) and calls the function `func_1(s)`.
   - The function `func_1(s)` calculates the cost to sort the string \( s \).

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the string \( s \).
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there have been '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.
   - The function returns the total `cost`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function correctly identifies the number of '1's before each '0' and calculates the cost accordingly.
   - The cost calculation is based on the idea that each '0' that appears after a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move it to the correct position, and the cost is the number of '1's before it plus one (for the '0' itself).
   - The function does not modify the string \( s \), which is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The function handles the edge case where the string is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's) by not adding any cost.

5. **Example Validation:**
   - **Test Case 1: "10"**
     - `one` is 1 after the first character.
     - The second character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 2.
     - Output: 2 (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2: "0000"**
     - No '1's, so `cost` remains 0.
     - Output: 0 (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3: "11000"**
     - `one` is 2 after the second character.
     - The third character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
     - The fourth character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
     - The fifth character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
     - Total `cost` = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
     - Output: 9 (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4: "101011"**
     - `one` is 1 after the first character.
     - The second character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 2.
     - `one` is 2 after the third character.
     - The fourth character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
     - Total `cost` = 2 + 3 = 5.
     - Output: 5 (Correct)
   - **Test Case 5: "01101001"**
     - `one` is 2 after the third character.
     - The fourth character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 3.
     - `one` is 3 after the fifth character.
     - The sixth character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 4.
     - The seventh character is '0', so `cost` is incremented by `one + 1` = 4.
     - Total `cost` = 3 + 4 + 4 = 11.
     - Output: 11 (Correct)
