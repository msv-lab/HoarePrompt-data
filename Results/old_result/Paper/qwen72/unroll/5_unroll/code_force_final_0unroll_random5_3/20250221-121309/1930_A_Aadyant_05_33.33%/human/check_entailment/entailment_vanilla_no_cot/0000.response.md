Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting and Selection**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list, selecting every second element (starting from the first) and adding it to a new list `list2`. This ensures that the smallest elements are chosen first, which is optimal for maximizing the score since \(\min(x, y)\) will always be the smaller of the two numbers.

3. **Summing and Output**:
   - The program sums the elements in `list2` and appends the result to the `out` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in `out`.

The logic of the program is correct and follows the optimal strategy for the problem. By sorting the list and always selecting the smallest available number, the program ensures that the score is maximized. The use of `del` to clear the lists is not strictly necessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.
