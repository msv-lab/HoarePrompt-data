The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the range `32`. For the loop to execute, the range must be valid and `i` must be within the range.

- The range is `32`, which is a fixed value and does not need adjustment.
- The variable `i` must start at `0` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be `0`.

State: **`prefix` is a list of integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with an initial value of `0`, `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each containing two zeros, `i` is 0**
