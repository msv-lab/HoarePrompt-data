Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of the described operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid (n and m) and the grid itself.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - **Single Row or Column**: If the grid has only one row or one column, the program implicitly handles this case by checking the first and last rows and columns. If the grid is already uniform, it will output "YES".
   - **Uniform Rows and Columns**: The program checks if the first row and the last row are uniform but different from each other, or if the first column and the last column are uniform but different from each other. If either of these conditions is true, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform in such cases.

3. **General Case**:
   - If the first row and the last row are not uniform or are the same, and the first column and the last column are not uniform or are the same, the program prints "YES". This is because if there are any two squares of the same color in the grid, you can always perform operations to make the entire grid uniform.

The logic in the program ensures that it correctly identifies the scenarios where it is impossible to make the grid uniform and where it is possible. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description.
