### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - **Inaccuracy:** The function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order. This is a critical flaw because the problem statement explicitly allows for such operations.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The results for each test case are collected in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
   - **Inaccuracy:** The function `func_2` relies on `func_1` to determine if the array can be sorted, but `func_1` is not correctly implemented to handle the problem's requirements. Therefore, `func_2` will also produce incorrect results.

### Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly checks if the array is already sorted.
  - However, it does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.
  - For example, the array `[3, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` is not sorted, but it can be sorted by splitting it into `[3, 1]` and `[4, 5, 1, 4]` and swapping them to get `[4, 5, 1, 4, 3, 1]`, which is still not sorted. However, the correct approach would be to split it into `[3, 1, 4, 5]` and `[1, 4]` and swap them to get `[1, 4, 3, 1, 4, 5]`, which can then be split and swapped again to achieve a sorted array.
  - Therefore, `func_1` is not sufficient to solve the problem as described.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
  - It calls `func_1` for each test case, which is incorrect as explained above.
  - The function does not implement the logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not enough to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.
