Output State: **An error occurred, `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, such that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd.** 

The code `dx, dy = b` attempts to unpack the integer `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`, which is not possible because an integer is not an iterable. Therefore, the error persists, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
