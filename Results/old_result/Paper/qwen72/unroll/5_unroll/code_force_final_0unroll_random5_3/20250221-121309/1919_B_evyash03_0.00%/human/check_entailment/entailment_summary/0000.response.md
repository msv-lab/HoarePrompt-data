Reasoning:

The program aims to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting a string `s` into non-empty arrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty for a single array is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The provided function `func_1` does not directly calculate the penalty as described in the problem. Instead, it seems to count the number of times the balance (sum of elements in the array) goes below zero and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties of all subarrays.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = "+"` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = "-"`.
2. Split the array `a` into subarrays in such a way that the total penalty is minimized. This can be achieved by ensuring that each subarray has a sum as close to zero as possible, and by avoiding subarrays with large sums.

The current implementation of `func_1` does not perform the required splitting or calculate the penalty correctly. Instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which is not the same as the penalty calculation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
