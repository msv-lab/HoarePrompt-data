Output State: **`final` is an empty list, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and `n` is a string.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 5000, and `n` is a string. The code snippet initializes an empty list named `final`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
