### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes the `players` dictionary to store the positions of the players.
   - It initializes the `goals` dictionary to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It defines the `mouvements` dictionary to map the movement directions to their respective changes in coordinates.
   - It initializes the scores for both teams (`pointsb` for blue and `pointsr` for red) to zero.

2. **Reading the Field:**
   - The program correctly iterates through each row and column of the field.
   - It skips empty cells (`..`) and the initial position of the Quaffle (`.Q`).
   - It appends the positions of the goals to the respective team's list in the `goals` dictionary.
   - It stores the positions of the players in the `players` dictionary.

3. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `moves`.
   - It iterates through each move.
   - If the move is a direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - If the move is a throw (`T`), it checks if the player is at a goal position:
     - If the player is at a red goal, it increments the blue team's score and prints the event.
     - If the player is at a blue goal, it increments the red team's score and prints the event.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes the current position of an entity and the movement direction, and returns the new position after applying the movement.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Quaffle Position Management:**
  - The program does not manage the position of the Quaffle explicitly. It assumes that the Quaffle is always carried by a player or is in the middle of the field.
  - The Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but this is not handled in the code.

- **Catching the Quaffle:**
  - The program does not handle the action of catching the Quaffle (`C`). This is a critical part of the game rules, and the program should update the player's state to indicate they are carrying the Quaffle.

- **Player Carrying the Quaffle:**
  - The program does not track which player is carrying the Quaffle. This is necessary to determine if a player can throw the Quaffle.

- **Resetting the Quaffle:**
  - After a goal is scored, the Quaffle should be reset to the middle of the field. The program does not handle this reset.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func_1` is correctly called with the current position of the player and the movement direction.
  - The function returns the new coordinates after applying the movement.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the Quaffle's position, the action of catching the Quaffle, or the state of which player is carrying the Quaffle. These are essential parts of the game rules and need to be implemented for the program to be correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
