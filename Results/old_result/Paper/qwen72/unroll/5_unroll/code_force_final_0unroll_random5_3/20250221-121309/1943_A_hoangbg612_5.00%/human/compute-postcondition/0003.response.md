The function `func` does not explicitly show its parameters in the provided code snippet, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Since the output is not specified in the provided information, we can only describe the parameters and the constraints they must satisfy. The function's purpose is not clear from the given information, so we will focus on the parameters and constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
