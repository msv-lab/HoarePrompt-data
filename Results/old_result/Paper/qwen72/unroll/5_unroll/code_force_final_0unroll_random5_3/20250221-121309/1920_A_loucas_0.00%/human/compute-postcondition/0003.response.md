The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. The constraints are pairs (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `1 <= x <= 10^9`. The constraints dictate that `k` must satisfy the following:
- If `a` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`.
- If `a` is 2, `k` must be less than or equal to `x`.
- If `a` is 3, `k` must be not equal to `x`.

The function is expected to find an integer `k` that satisfies all the constraints for each test case. If such a `k` exists, the function returns `k`; otherwise, it returns an indication that no such `k` can be found.

Functionality: **The function operates on a set of test cases, each containing constraints on an integer `k`. It returns an integer `k` that satisfies all constraints for each test case, or indicates that no such `k` exists.**
