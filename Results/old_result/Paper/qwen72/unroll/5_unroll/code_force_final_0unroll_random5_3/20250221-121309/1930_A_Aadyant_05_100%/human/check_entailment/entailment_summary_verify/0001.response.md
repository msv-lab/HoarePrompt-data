### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `a` (which is `n`), but this value is not used in the subsequent calculations. This is indeed unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.
   - It then reads the list of `2n` integers from the input, splits the string into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer, storing them in `list2`.

2. **Sorting the List:**
   - The program sorts the list `list2` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available number with the next smallest number. By sorting, we ensure that the smallest numbers are paired first, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

3. **Calculating the Score:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score `s`. This is correct because, in a sorted list, the first element of each pair is the smaller of the two, and thus the minimum value.
   - The sum of the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) is calculated and appended to the `final` list.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the final scores for each test case.

### Function Summary:
- The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers from the user, sorts the list, and calculates the sum of the elements at even indices.
- The function then prints the sum for each test case.
- The function does not return any value, but it prints a list of `t` integers, each being the sum of the elements at even indices of a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- The final state of the program is that `t` remains an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), `n` remains a string, and the `final` list contains `t` integers.

### Evaluation:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of pairs `a` but does not use it. This is unnecessary but does not affect the correctness of the program.
  - The program reads the list of integers in a single line for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

- **Sorting the List:**
  - Sorting the list is correct and necessary for the optimal solution.

- **Calculating the Score:**
  - The program correctly sums the elements at even indices, which are the minimum values of each pair in the sorted list.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the final scores for each test case, which is the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. The unnecessary reading of `a` does not impact the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
