### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `ntest` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The function sorts the array `a`. Sorting is a valid step because the problem allows rearranging the elements in any way, and sorting helps in maximizing the beauty of the array.

3. **Calculating the Beauty:**
   - The function initializes `kq` to 0, which will store the maximum beauty.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array, calculating the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs from the ends towards the center.
   - The formula used is `kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]`, which correctly calculates the difference between the i-th largest and i-th smallest elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated beauty `kq` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`), resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - The function also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements, as the middle element is not included in the difference calculation, which is correct.

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic of sorting the array and then calculating the differences in pairs from the ends towards the center is correct for maximizing the beauty of the array.
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each.
