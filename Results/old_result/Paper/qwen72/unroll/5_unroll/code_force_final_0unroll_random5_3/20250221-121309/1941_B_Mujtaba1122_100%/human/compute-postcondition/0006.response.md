Postcondition: **list[i - 1] is 0 for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, list[i] is 1 or less for all i in the range 1 to n - 2, and list[i + 1] is reduced by the cumulative value of list[i - 1] for all i in the range 1 to n - 2. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function returns `False`.**
