### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes the index to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b` from the list, incrementing the index accordingly.
   - This approach is efficient for handling large inputs and ensures that the program can process multiple test cases in a single batch.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its symmetric character in the list.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in a batch, which is efficient for large inputs.
  - The index is incremented correctly to move through the input list, ensuring that the correct values are read for each test case.

- **Decoding Logic**:
  - The `func_1` function correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them.
  - The dictionary `char_map` is constructed to map each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
  - The decoding process uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string, which is the reverse of the encoding process.
  - The function summary confirms that the `char_map` is constructed and used correctly to decode the string.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.
  - It also handles the case where the encoded string has all distinct characters.
  - The function summary indicates that the `char_map` is constructed and used correctly, ensuring that the decoding process is accurate for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input efficiently, constructs the necessary mappings, and decodes the strings accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
