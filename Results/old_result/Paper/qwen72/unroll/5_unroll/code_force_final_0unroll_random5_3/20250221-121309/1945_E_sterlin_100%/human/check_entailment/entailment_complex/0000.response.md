Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the integers `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with initial values `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `right - left` is 1.
   - In each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated, and the element at `p[mid]` is compared with `x`.
   - If `p[mid]` is less than or equal to `x`, `left` is updated to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, `right` is updated to `mid`.

3. **Output Logic**:
   - After the binary search loop, if `p[left]` is equal to `x`, no swaps are needed, and the program outputs `0`.
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` array, one swap is needed to place `x` at the correct position, and the program outputs `1` followed by the indices to swap.
   - If `x` is seen but not at the correct position, two swaps are needed to place `x` correctly, and the program outputs `2` followed by the indices to swap.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_indx` to store the indices of the elements in the permutation.
   - The `seen` array keeps track of which elements have been encountered during the binary search.
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` array, a single swap is performed to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` array but not at the correct position, two swaps are performed to place `x` correctly.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The binary search logic is correct for a permutation, even though the permutation is not sorted.
   - The swapping logic ensures that the element `x` is placed at the correct position within the allowed number of swaps (0, 1, or 2).

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - The binary search and swapping logic are implemented correctly to ensure that the element `x` is found in the permutation after at most 2 swaps.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets the problem description and is correct.

Correctness: **True**
