The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, as the loop will run `t` times. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set by the `range(t)` function to values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
