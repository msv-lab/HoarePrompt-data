### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements).

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and the elements in `b` using the `min` function to ensure that the count does not exceed the frequency in either array.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` and update the count of matches.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - If the number of matches is at least `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.
     - It adjusts the frequency and matches count by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the element that is sliding into the window.
     - The program correctly updates the `window_freq` counter and the `matches` count.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks the last window to see if it is good and updates the count of good subarrays if necessary.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of good subarrays for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for counting matches and updating the window is sound.

Correctness: **True**
