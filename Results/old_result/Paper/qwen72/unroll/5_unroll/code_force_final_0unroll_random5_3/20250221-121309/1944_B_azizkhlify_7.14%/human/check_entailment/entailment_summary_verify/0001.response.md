### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each element in the first half and the second half of `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of `a` and stores them in `l`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each element in the second half of `a` and stores them in `r`.

3. **Constructing Subsets `l` and `r`:**
   - The program attempts to construct the subset `l` by iterating through the first half of `a` and selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the first half.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count `ul` to keep track of how many elements have been selected for `l`.
   - If the required number of elements (2k) is not yet reached, it continues to select elements that appear exactly once in the first half and stores them in `res`.

4. **Constructing Subset `r`:**
   - The program then constructs the subset `r` by iterating through the second half of `a` and selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the second half.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count `ur` to keep track of how many elements have been selected for `r`.
   - The program ensures that the number of elements selected for `l` and `r` is the same.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `k` is within the valid range.
   - It also ensures that the total number of elements selected for `l` and `r` is `2k`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` in the required format.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Counting and Selection:**
  - The program uses `l` and `r` arrays to count occurrences, but it does not correctly handle the selection of elements for the subsets.
  - The logic for selecting elements that appear exactly twice in the first half and then selecting elements that appear exactly once is flawed.
  - The program does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `l` and `r` is the same.

- **Incorrect Use of `ul` and `ur`:**
  - The program uses `ul` and `ur` to track the number of elements selected for `l` and `r`, but it does not correctly initialize or update these variables.
  - The condition `if ul != ur` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect behavior.

- **Incorrect Handling of `res`:**
  - The `res` list is used to store elements that appear exactly once in the first half, but it is not used correctly to ensure the XOR condition.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for selecting elements and ensuring the XOR condition is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
