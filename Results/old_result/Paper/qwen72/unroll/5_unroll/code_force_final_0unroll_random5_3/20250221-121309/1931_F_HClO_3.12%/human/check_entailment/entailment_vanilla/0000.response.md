### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program directly prints "yes" because a single screenshot can always correspond to the order of participants.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the user IDs (`a1` and `a2`) and the lists of other participants (`l1` and `l2`).
   - It then removes the user ID of the second screenshot from the first list and vice versa to create `l11` and `l22`.

4. **Initial Comparison**:
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the program prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is because if the lists of participants (excluding the user who posted the screenshot) are different, it is impossible for them to correspond to the same order.

5. **Finding the Mismatch**:
   - The program initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first mismatch. If the mismatch is due to `a1` and `a2` being in different positions, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` accordingly.
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are set, it breaks the loop.

6. **Inserting the User ID**:
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, the program inserts the user ID back into the appropriate list to create a consistent order.
   - If `m == 2`, the program prints "yes" and continues to the next test case.

7. **Checking Remaining Screenshots**:
   - For the remaining screenshots, the program reads the user ID and the list of participants.
   - It checks if the list of participants (excluding the user who posted the screenshot) matches the consistent order created earlier.
   - If any list does not match, the program prints "no" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all lists match, the program prints "yes".

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the single screenshot case.
- For multiple screenshots, the program checks if the lists of participants (excluding the user who posted the screenshot) can be made consistent by inserting the user ID back into the appropriate position.
- The logic for finding the mismatch and inserting the user ID is correct.
- The program also correctly checks the remaining screenshots to ensure they all correspond to the same consistent order.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
