Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input. It then computes a value based on the following conditions: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it calculates and prints a more complex expression involving `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained between iterations. **
