The function reads an integer `num` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a space-separated list of integers `b`. It then sorts the list `b`, selects the first `a` integers, and appends their sum to a list `out`. After processing all test cases, it prints each integer in `out`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `num` is the input string, `a` is the last input integer read in the loop, and `out` is a list of `int(num)` integers where each integer is the sum of the first `a` sorted integers from the corresponding input list. The values of `t` and `n` are not used or modified by the function.
