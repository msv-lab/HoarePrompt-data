You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (where 1 <= n <= 20 and `password` consists of lowercase Latin letters and digits). It returns 'NO' if any of the following conditions are met: the letters in `password` are not in sorted order, the digits in `password` are not in sorted order, or there is a transition from a letter to a digit in the `password`. If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` or `password`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Validation**:
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` for lowercase letters and `digits` for digits.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the password consists of only letters or only digits.
   - The program ensures that all letters and digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - The program ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

4. **Output**:
   - If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.
   - If any condition is not met, the program returns 'NO'.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `12ac`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2']` (sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `123wa`
  - Letters: `['a', 'w']` (not sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `allllmost`
  - Letters: `['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'm', 'o', 's', 't']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `[]` (empty, considered sorted)
  - No digit comes after a letter.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `ac123`
  - Letters: `['a', 'c']` (sorted)
  - Digits: `['1', '2', '3']` (sorted)
  - Digit '1' comes after a letter 'c'.
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `011679`
  - Letters: `[]` (empty, considered sorted)
  - Digits: `['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']` (sorted)
  - No letter comes before a digit.
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to validate the password based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided test cases.
