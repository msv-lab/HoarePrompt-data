### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the program directly prints "yes" because a single screenshot can always correspond to the order of participants.
   - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Multiple Screenshots Case**:
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and extracts the user IDs (`a1` and `a2`) and the lists of other participants (`l1` and `l2`).
   - It then removes the user ID of the second screenshot from the first list and vice versa to create `l11` and `l22`.

4. **Initial Comparison**:
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the program prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is because if the lists of participants (excluding the user who posted the screenshot) are different, it is impossible for them to correspond to the same order.
   - This step is crucial and correctly implemented.

5. **Finding the Mismatch**:
   - The program initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first mismatch. If the mismatch is due to `a1` and `a2` being in different positions, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` accordingly.
   - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are set, it breaks the loop.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that the program can identify the position where the user IDs need to be inserted to make the lists consistent.

6. **Inserting the User ID**:
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, the program inserts the user ID back into the appropriate list to create a consistent order.
   - If `m == 2`, the program prints "yes" and continues to the next test case.
   - This step is also correctly implemented.

7. **Checking Remaining Screenshots**:
   - For the remaining screenshots, the program reads the user ID and the list of participants.
   - It checks if the list of participants (excluding the user who posted the screenshot) matches the consistent order created earlier.
   - If any list does not match, the program prints "no" and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all lists match, the program prints "yes".
   - This step ensures that the program verifies the consistency of the order across all screenshots.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Comparison**:
  - The program correctly identifies that if `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the order cannot be consistent. This is a valid check and aligns with the problem description.

- **Finding the Mismatch**:
  - The program correctly finds the first mismatch and sets `idx1` and `idx2` accordingly. This ensures that the program can determine the correct position to insert the user IDs.

- **Inserting the User ID**:
  - The program correctly inserts the user ID back into the appropriate list to create a consistent order. This step is essential for ensuring that the order of participants is the same across all screenshots.

- **Checking Remaining Screenshots**:
  - The program correctly checks the remaining screenshots to ensure they all correspond to the same consistent order. This is a crucial step and is implemented correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots.
