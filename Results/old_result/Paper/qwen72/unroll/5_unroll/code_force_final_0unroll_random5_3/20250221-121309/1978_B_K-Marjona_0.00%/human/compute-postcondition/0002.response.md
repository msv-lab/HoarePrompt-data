The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, possibly in the form of a list or tuple, where the first parameter `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, there are three parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. Each of these parameters is an integer with specific constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters, starting with an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.**
