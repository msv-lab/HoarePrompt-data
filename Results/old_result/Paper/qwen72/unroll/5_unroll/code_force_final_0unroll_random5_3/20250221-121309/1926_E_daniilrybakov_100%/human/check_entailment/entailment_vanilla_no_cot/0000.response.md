Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct for the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k` for each case.

2. **Logic for Card Placement**:
   - The program uses a loop to determine the position of the card based on the given rules.
   - It starts with `m = 1` and `s = 0`, where `m` represents the current multiplier (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.) and `s` keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down so far.
   - For each iteration, it calculates `x` as the number of cards that can be laid down in the current step, which is `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - It then updates `n` to `n // 2`, effectively reducing the problem size to the next set of cards (twice, four times, etc. the odd numbers).
   - If the position `k` falls within the range of cards laid down in the current step (`s < k and k <= s + x`), it breaks out of the loop.
   - It then calculates the k-th card laid down using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the k-th card for each test case.

This logic aligns with the problem description and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
