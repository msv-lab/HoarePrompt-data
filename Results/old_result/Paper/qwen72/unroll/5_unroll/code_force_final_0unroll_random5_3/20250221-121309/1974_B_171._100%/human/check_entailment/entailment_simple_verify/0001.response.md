### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases and ensures that the entire input is processed in one go.
   - The index is initialized to 0 and is used to iterate through the input list. The number of test cases `t` is read from the first element of the list, and the index is incremented correctly.
   - For each test case, the program reads the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b` from the list, incrementing the index accordingly. This ensures that the input is read in the correct order and format.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`. This step is crucial because it ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order, which is required for the symmetric mapping.
   - It then constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its symmetric character in the list. This is done by iterating through the list and mapping the i-th character to the (len_unique - 1 - i)-th character.
   - The decoding process uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from the `char_map`. This is the reverse of the encoding process, where each character is replaced by its symmetric character.

3. **Output**:
   - The program appends the decoded string for each test case to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the `results` list. This ensures that the output is in the correct format and order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For a single-character string, the `unique_chars` list will contain only one character, and the `char_map` will map that character to itself.
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly. The `unique_chars` list will only contain distinct characters, and the `char_map` will map each character to its symmetric character, regardless of how many times it appears in the encoded string.
   - The program handles the case where the encoded string has all distinct characters correctly. In this case, the `unique_chars` list will contain all characters from the encoded string, and the `char_map` will map each character to its symmetric character.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input efficiently, constructs the necessary mappings, and decodes the strings accurately. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
