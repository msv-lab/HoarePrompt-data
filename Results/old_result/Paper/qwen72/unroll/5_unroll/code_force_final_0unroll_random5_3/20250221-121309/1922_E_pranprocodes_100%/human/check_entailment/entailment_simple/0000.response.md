### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct an array of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements in the array where each element is strictly greater than the previous one.
   - The array elements should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program uses a loop to construct the array `ans` based on the value of `x`.
   - If `x` is even, it appends the current maximum value to `ans`, decreases the maximum value by 1, and divides `x` by 2.
   - If `x` is odd, it appends the current minimum value to `ans`, increases the minimum value by 1, and decreases `x` by 1.
   - The loop continues until `x` becomes 1.
   - The array `ans` is then reversed and printed.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm attempts to construct an array by alternating between appending the maximum and minimum values, which is a reasonable approach to generate different subsequences.
   - However, the algorithm does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic of appending maximum and minimum values does not inherently ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences.
   - The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to ensure the exact count of increasing subsequences, which this algorithm does not provide.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which should return an array of length 1 with a single element.
   - The program does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a constraint in the problem.
   - The program does not handle the case where no such array exists, which should return -1.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `X = 2`, the program outputs `1 0`, which is correct because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
   - For `X = 5`, the program outputs `3 0 1 0`, which is incorrect because the array `[0, 1, 0]` does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For `X = 13`, the program outputs `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which is incorrect because the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` does not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For `X = 37`, the program outputs `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is incorrect because the array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` does not have exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
