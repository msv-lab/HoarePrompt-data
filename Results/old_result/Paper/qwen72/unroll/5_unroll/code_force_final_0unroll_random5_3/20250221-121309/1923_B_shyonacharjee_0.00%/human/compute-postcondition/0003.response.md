The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function operates on a set of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of elements in the lists `a` and `x`, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers. The function is expected to process each test case and return a result for each test case.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `x` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function `func_1` processes each test case and returns a result for each test case. The exact nature of the result is not specified in the output, but it is implied that the function will return a list or collection of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, a list of `n` integers `a`, and a list of `n` distinct integers `x` (where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0). It returns a result for each test case, likely a list or collection of results.**
