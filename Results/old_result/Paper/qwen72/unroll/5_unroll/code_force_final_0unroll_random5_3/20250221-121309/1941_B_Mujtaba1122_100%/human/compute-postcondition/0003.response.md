Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `list[i - 1]` is 0 for all `i` in the range 1 to `n - 2`.
2. `list[i]` is 1 or less for all `i` in the range 1 to `n - 2`.
3. `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the cumulative value of `list[i - 1]` for all `i` in the range 1 to `n - 2.
4. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.

### Analysis:
- The first condition states that for all indices `i` from 1 to `n - 2`, the element at `list[i - 1]` is 0. This means that the elements from index 0 to `n - 3` are all 0.
- The second condition states that for all indices `i` from 1 to `n - 2`, the element at `list[i]` is 1 or less. This means that the elements from index 1 to `n - 2` are either 0 or 1.
- The third condition states that for all indices `i` from 1 to `n - 2`, the element at `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the cumulative value of `list[i - 1]`. Since `list[i - 1]` is always 0, this reduction does not change the value of `list[i + 1]`.
- The fourth condition states that the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state and the function `func_1(list, n)` returning `True` do not affect the content of the `print` statement directly. They provide context but do not change the output of the `print` statement.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
