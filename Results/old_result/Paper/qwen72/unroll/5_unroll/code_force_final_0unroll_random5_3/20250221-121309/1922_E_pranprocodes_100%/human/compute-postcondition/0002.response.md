The function `func` accepts a parameter `X`. `X` is an integer within the range 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18. The function returns either -1 if no such array exists, or a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of the array, followed by a list of `n` integers, each in the range [-10^9, 10^9], that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `X` and returns either -1 if no such array exists, or a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.**
