Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on any chosen substring. The solution provided in `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's encountered before each '0' in the string, adding `n + 1` to the total cost for each such '0', where `n` is the count of '1's before the '0'. This approach is based on the observation that each '0' that appears after a '1' in the string needs to be moved to the left of all '1's to sort the string, and the cost of moving a '0' is the length of the substring that includes the '0' and all '1's before it.

However, this approach does not correctly handle the case where the string starts with a '0' and ends with a '1', which would require a different strategy to minimize the cost. Specifically, if the string starts with a '0' and ends with a '1', the optimal strategy might involve a cyclic shift of the entire string to move the '1' to the beginning, which is not accounted for in the current implementation.

For example, consider the string "01101001". The current implementation will calculate the cost as follows:
- '0' at index 4: 4 + 1 = 5
- '0' at index 6: 4 + 1 = 5
- '0' at index 7: 4 + 1 = 5
- Total cost: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15

However, the optimal solution involves cyclically shifting the entire string once to move the '1' at the end to the beginning, resulting in a total cost of 8 (the length of the string).

Given this oversight, the program does not always produce the correct minimum cost for sorting the binary string.

Correctness: **False**
