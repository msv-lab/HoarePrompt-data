The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The output of the function is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function will return a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 1000), `n` is an integer (2 <= n <= 10^6), and `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n). The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
