### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` that needs to be found.
   - We can perform up to 2 swaps on the permutation to make it possible for binary search to find `x`.
   - The binary search algorithm is described, and it is guaranteed that 2 swaps are always sufficient to find `x`.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and then the permutation `p`.

3. **Binary Search on Permutations**:
   - Binary search requires the array to be sorted, but the permutation is not sorted.
   - The goal is to rearrange the permutation so that the binary search can find `x` by performing at most 2 swaps.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - The program does not implement the binary search algorithm itself, but it is supposed to output the swaps needed to make the binary search work.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input in different formats, but the main logic for solving the problem is missing.

5. **Missing Logic**:
   - The program does not contain any logic to determine the necessary swaps.
   - It only reads input and does not process it to find the required swaps.

6. **Expected Output**:
   - For each test case, the program should output the number of swaps `k` and the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The program does not produce any output related to the swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It only reads input but does not perform any operations to rearrange the permutation or output the required swaps.

**Correctness: False**
