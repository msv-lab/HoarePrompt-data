The function `func` accepts no parameters. It internally handles multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns the results for each test case. The exact return value for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes the list of integers and returns some output based on the input.

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and internally handles multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function returns the results for each test case, processing the list of integers and providing an output based on the input.**
