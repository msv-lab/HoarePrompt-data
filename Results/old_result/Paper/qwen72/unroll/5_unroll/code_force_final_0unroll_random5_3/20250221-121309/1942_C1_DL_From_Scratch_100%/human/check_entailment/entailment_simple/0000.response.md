Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of pairs of adjacent chosen vertices that are separated by exactly one unchosen vertex. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not fully account for the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed. The program only counts the number of gaps of size 1 between chosen vertices and adds `x - 2` to this count, which is not a correct way to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. **Triangular Pieces from Chosen Vertices**: For a set of chosen vertices, the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces can be maximized by forming as many triangles as possible using these vertices. Each set of three chosen vertices can form a triangle.
2. **Counting Triangles**: The number of triangles that can be formed from `x` chosen vertices is given by the combination formula \( \binom{x}{3} \), which is the number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of `x` to form a triangle.
3. **Handling Gaps**: If there are gaps between chosen vertices, we need to consider how these gaps can be used to form additional triangles. However, since `y = 0`, we cannot choose any additional vertices to form more triangles.

The program provided does not correctly implement this logic. It only counts the number of gaps of size 1 and adds `x - 2` to this count, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
