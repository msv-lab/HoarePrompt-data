### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower in each move.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Initial Condition:** The tower starts with 0 cubes.
   - **Addition and Removal:** Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - **Final Condition:** After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - If `n` is the number of moves and `m` is the final number of cubes, then the number of cubes added must be equal to the number of cubes removed plus `m`.
   - Let `a` be the number of cubes added and `r` be the number of cubes removed.
   - We have the equation: \( a - r = m \).
   - The total number of moves is \( a + r = n \).

4. **Solving the Equations:**
   - From the equations \( a - r = m \) and \( a + r = n \), we can solve for `a` and `r`:
     - \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \)
     - \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \)
   - Both `a` and `r` must be non-negative integers. Therefore, \( n - m \) must be even (since `r` must be an integer), and \( n \ge m \) (since `a` must be non-negative).

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n >= m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Verification:**
   - The conditions `n >= m` and `(n - m) % 2 == 0` are necessary and sufficient to ensure that it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - The program correctly implements these conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
