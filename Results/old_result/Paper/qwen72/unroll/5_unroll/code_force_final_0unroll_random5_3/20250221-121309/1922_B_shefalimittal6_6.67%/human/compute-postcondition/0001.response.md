The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to a value, but it will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.

Given that `t` is an input integer and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 for the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
