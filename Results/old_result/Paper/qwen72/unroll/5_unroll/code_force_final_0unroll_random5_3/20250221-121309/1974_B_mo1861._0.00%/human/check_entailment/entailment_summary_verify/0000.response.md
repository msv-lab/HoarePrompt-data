### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. Let's break down the issues and the intended behavior step by step:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The encoding process involves creating a new string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r` (first character maps to the last, second to the second last, etc.).

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We should create the same `r` string from the distinct characters of the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - Then, we map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a `char_map` dictionary by mapping each character in the sorted set of `b` to a character in the reverse order of the alphabet.
   - This is incorrect because the mapping should be based on the symmetric positions within the sorted set of unique characters, not the entire alphabet.

4. **Example**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     abc
     ```
   - The correct output should be:
     ```
     cba
     ```
   - However, the program will output:
     ```
     zyx
     ```
   - This is because the program maps 'a' to 'z', 'b' to 'y', and 'c' to 'x', instead of mapping 'a' to 'c', 'b' to 'b', and 'c' to 'a'.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should create a `char_map` dictionary where each character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in the same set.
   - For example, if `b` is "serofedsoc", the sorted set of unique characters is "cdefors".
   - The mapping should be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'n'
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary correctly describes the intended behavior of `func_1`, but the actual implementation in the program does not match this description.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the encoding and decoding process as described in the problem. The `char_map` dictionary is created incorrectly, leading to incorrect decoding.

Final: **False**
