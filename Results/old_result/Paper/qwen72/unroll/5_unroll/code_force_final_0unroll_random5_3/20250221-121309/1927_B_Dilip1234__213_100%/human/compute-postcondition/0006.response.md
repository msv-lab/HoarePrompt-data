Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a string `s` of length `n` where each character in `s` is determined by the trace `a` and the count of each character from 'a' to 'z' that has been added to `s`. The `char_count` array, which is used internally, tracks the number of times each character from 'a' to 'z' has been added to `s`. After the function concludes, the input variables `n` and `a` remain unchanged, and the string `s` is the final output. **
