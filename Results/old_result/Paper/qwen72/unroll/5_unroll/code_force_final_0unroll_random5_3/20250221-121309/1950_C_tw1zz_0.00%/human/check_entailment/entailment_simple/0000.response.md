Reasoning:

The program attempts to convert a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. Let's break down the logic and check if it handles all the cases correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".

2. **Hour and Minute Extraction**: The program splits the input string `s` by the colon `:` to extract the hour `h` and minute `m`.

3. **Time Conversion**:
   - For hours from '01' to '11', the program correctly sets `h1` to the same hour and `time` to 'AM'.
   - For hour '12', the program correctly sets `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'AM'.
   - For hours from '13' to '23', the program correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding hour in the 12-hour format (i.e., '01' for '13', '02' for '14', etc.) and `time` to 'PM'.
   - For hour '00', the program incorrectly sets `h1` to '12' and `time` to 'PM'. This is a mistake because '00:00' in 24-hour format should be '12:00 AM' in 12-hour format.

4. **Output**: The program prints the converted time in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM".

Given the incorrect handling of the '00' hour, the program will produce the wrong output for the '00:00' case and any other time where the hour is '00'. For example, '00:59' should be '12:59 AM', but the program will output '12:59 PM'.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
