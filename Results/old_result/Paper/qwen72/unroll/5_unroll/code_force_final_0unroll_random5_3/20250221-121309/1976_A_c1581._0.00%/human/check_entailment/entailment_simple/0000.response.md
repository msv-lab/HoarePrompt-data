### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the password and the password itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and efficiently handles multiple test cases.

2. **Password Verification:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for verifying if the password meets the specified conditions.
   - It separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter. If it does, the function immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Conditions Verification:**
   - **No digit after a letter:** The program correctly identifies if a digit appears after a letter by maintaining the `last_digit_index` and checking if a letter appears after a digit.
   - **Digits sorted in non-decreasing order:** The program correctly checks if the `digits` list is sorted.
   - **Letters sorted in non-decreasing order:** The program correctly checks if the `letters` list is sorted.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles passwords with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the password is empty or consists of a single character.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case and prints them in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
