The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` lines containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` based on the inputs and prints `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged after each test case, and the internal variables `M`, `c`, and `a` are reset for each new test case.
