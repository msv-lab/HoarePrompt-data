### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_4` reads the number of vertices and edges for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the edges and their weights for each test case.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - `func_6` constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and a list of edges.
   - The edges are sorted in descending order by weight, which is a key step for finding the minimum weight edge in a cycle.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - `DSU` is initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing.
   - The `find` and `union` methods are used to manage the connected components of the graph.

4. **Cycle Detection and Minimum Weight Edge:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to union the components of the vertices connected by each edge.
   - If the vertices are already in the same component, it means a cycle is detected, and the program updates the minimum weight edge and the nodes involved in the cycle.

5. **Depth-First Search (DFS) for Cycle:**
   - `dfs` is used to find the cycle starting from one of the nodes of the minimum weight edge.
   - The function marks nodes as visited and processed, and it returns the path of the cycle if it finds one.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Cycle Detection Logic:**
  - The cycle detection logic in `func_6` is flawed. The program should not union the nodes immediately when they are in the same component. Instead, it should only union nodes when they are in different components to avoid prematurely merging components.
  - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to union the nodes and `if parent_u == parent_v` to detect the cycle.

- **DFS Logic:**
  - The `dfs` function is not correctly implemented to find the cycle. It should return the cycle path when it detects a back edge to a node that is already in the path.
  - The current implementation of `dfs` does not correctly handle the backtracking and cycle detection.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the cycle detection and DFS logic, the program does not correctly find the simple cycle with the minimum weight edge.

**Correctness: False**
