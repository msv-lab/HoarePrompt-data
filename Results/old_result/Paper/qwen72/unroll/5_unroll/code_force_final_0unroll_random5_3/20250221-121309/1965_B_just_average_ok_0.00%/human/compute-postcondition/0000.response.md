The loop head in the given for loop is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is mentioned in the state but is not directly involved in the loop head. However, it is implied that `t` is the number of test cases, and the loop will iterate `t` times if `t` is the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n

To ensure the loop executes, the state must be adjusted to reflect that the input value for the loop must be at least 1, and the loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and the input value for the loop must be greater than 0**
