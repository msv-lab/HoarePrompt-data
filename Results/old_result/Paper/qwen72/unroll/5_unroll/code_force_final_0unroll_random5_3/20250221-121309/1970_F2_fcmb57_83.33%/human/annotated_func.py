#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 <= a, b <= 99, a and b are odd), and the field contains goals, players, the Quaffle, and possibly a Bludger, with the constraints on the number of players and goals as described.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns the values of `x + dx` and `y + dy`, where `x` and `y` are the initial positions, and `dx` and `dy` are the changes in position. However, since the initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy`, the exact returned values cannot be determined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. It expects `a` to be a tuple of two integers representing the initial positions `(x, y)`, and `b` to be a tuple of two integers representing the changes in position `(dx, dy)`. The function returns a new tuple containing the updated positions `(x + dx, y + dy)`. The exact values of the returned tuple depend on the input values of `a` and `b`.
