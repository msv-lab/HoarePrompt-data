You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4 and 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The array a is of length 2n and contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice. The function should handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        l = [0] * n
        
        r = [0] * n
        
        re = ul = ur = 0
        
        res = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            l[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            r[a[i] - 1] += 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                ul += 2
            if ul == k * 2:
                break
        
        k = 2 * k - ul
        
        if k:
            for i in range(n):
                if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                    print(a[i], end=' ')
                    re += 1
                    res.append(a[i])
                if re == k:
                    break
        
        print()
        
        for i in res:
            print(i, end=' ')
        
        if ul != ur:
            for i in range(n, 2 * n):
                if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                    print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                    ur += 2
                if ul == ur:
                    break
        
        print()
        
    #State: The loop processes each test case and prints pairs or single elements from the array `a` based on the conditions. After all iterations, the variables `l`, `r`, `re`, `ul`, `ur`, and `res` will be reset for each new test case, but the overall structure and constraints of the initial state remain unchanged. The loop will have completed all its iterations, and the output will be the result of the print statements within the loop for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, and an array `a` of length `2n` that contains each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters and constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
