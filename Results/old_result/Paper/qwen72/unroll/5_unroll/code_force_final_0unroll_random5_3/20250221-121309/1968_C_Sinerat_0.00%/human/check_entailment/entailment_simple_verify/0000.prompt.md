You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 500
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of integers `x` where `1 <= len(x) <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. The function should also accept an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 500`, and `n` is the length of the array `a` that needs to be constructed. The function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 500
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: The function will have processed `t` test cases, where for each test case, it constructs an array `a` of length `n` such that `a[0]` is always 500, and each subsequent element `a[i]` is the sum of the previous element `a[i-1]` and the corresponding element `x[i-1]` from the input list `x`. The final state of `a` for each test case is printed as a space-separated list of integers. The variables `t`, `n`, and `x` will retain their initial values as they are re-assigned in each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the initial value of `a[0]` is set to 500, which may not always satisfy the condition \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) and the modulo condition for the subsequent elements. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
2 4 1
```
The program will generate the array `a = [500, 502, 506, 507]`. However, this does not satisfy the condition \(x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2\), because \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\) is correct, but \(507 \bmod 506 = 1\) is also correct. The issue arises when the values of `x` are such that the initial value of 500 does not work. 

A correct approach would be to initialize `a[0]` with a value that is greater than the maximum possible value of `x` and then construct the array `a` accordingly. For example, setting `a[0]` to \(10^9\) would ensure that the modulo condition is always satisfied.
