### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the frequency of each exponent in `num_list`. This is necessary to determine how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Triangle Formation:**
   - The program then calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.
   - **Case 1: All three sticks have the same length.**
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these is given by the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - **Case 2: Two sticks have the same length, and one stick has a different length.**
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these and one stick from the remaining sticks is given by \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times \text{total\_count} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times \text{total\_count} \).
   - **Case 3: All three sticks have different lengths.**
     - This case is not explicitly handled in the program, but it is not necessary because the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, and the sum of two smaller powers of 2 is always less than or equal to the next power of 2. Therefore, it is impossible to form a triangle with three sticks of different lengths.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and then prints each result.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the input and output, and it correctly calculates the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles based on the given constraints and problem description. The logic for counting the combinations of sticks is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
