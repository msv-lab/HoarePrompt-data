Output State: **`t` is the integer value of the first string in `data`, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 <= arr_i <= 10^6, `input` is now a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 1.**

The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
