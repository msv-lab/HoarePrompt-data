### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.

2. **Sorting Check:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. This is a correct and efficient way to check if a list is sorted.

3. **Transformation Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array `list1` and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it replaces the current element with its digits in the same position. This is done by:
     - Removing the current element.
     - Inserting the tens digit at the current position.
     - Inserting the units digit at the next position.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After attempting to transform the array, the program uses `func_1` to check if the array is now sorted.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The transformation logic is not applied correctly. The program only attempts to transform the array once for each element, but it should continue transforming until no more transformations are possible or the array is sorted.
  - Specifically, the program should keep applying the transformation to elements that are greater than 10 and cause the array to be unsorted until no such elements exist.

- **Potential Infinite Loop:**
  - The current logic can lead to an infinite loop if the transformation does not result in a sorted array and the same elements keep being transformed repeatedly.

### Corrected Approach:
- **Recursive or Iterative Transformation:**
  - The transformation should be applied recursively or iteratively until no more elements greater than 10 can be found that cause the array to be unsorted.
  - This can be achieved by using a while loop to keep checking and transforming the array until it is sorted or no more transformations are possible.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation logic and can lead to incorrect results or infinite loops. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
