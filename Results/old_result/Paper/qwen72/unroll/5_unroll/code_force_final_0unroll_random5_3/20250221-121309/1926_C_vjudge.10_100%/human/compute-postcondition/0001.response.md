The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the input. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a list of integers (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), `inf` is 200001.
Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a list of integers (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), `inf` is 200001.**
