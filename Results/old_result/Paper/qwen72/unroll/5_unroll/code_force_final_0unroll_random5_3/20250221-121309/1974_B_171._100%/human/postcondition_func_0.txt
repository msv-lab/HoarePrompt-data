The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is created by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from a reverse mapping defined in `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `encoded` to the corresponding character in reverse order of the sorted unique characters. After the function concludes, the original `encoded` string remains unchanged, and the `decoded` string contains the characters from `encoded` transformed according to the reverse mapping.
