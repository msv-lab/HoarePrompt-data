Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, l is 'NO'.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are re-assigned in each iteration of the outer loop, but their properties (1 <= n <= 20, strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters) remain unchanged.
- The variable `l` is initially set to 'YES'. However, the inner loop checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for any character position `i`. If this condition is true for any `i`, `l` is set to 'YES'. If the loop completes without finding such a position, `l` is set to 'NO' by the `else` block. Since the `else` block is always executed if the inner loop completes without a break, `l` will be 'NO' after the outer loop finishes all iterations.
