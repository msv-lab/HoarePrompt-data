Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly simulate the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in how the program handles the player's moves and the calculation of their scores. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Moves**:
   - The program assumes that once a player reaches the position with the maximum value in the array `a`, they will stay there for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true. The player can choose to stay or move to `p_x` on each turn, and the optimal strategy might involve moving to `p_x` even if the current position has the maximum value in `a`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**:
   - The program calculates the scores by appending `maxa` to the score lists `b` and `s` once a player reaches the maximum value in `a`. This is incorrect because the score should be calculated based on the actual values in `a` at each position the player moves to, not just the maximum value.

3. **Inefficient and Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns, but it breaks early if both players have found the maximum value in `a`. This is not a valid approach because the game should be simulated for the full `k` turns, and the optimal strategy should be considered at each turn.

4. **Missing Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy for each player. The optimal strategy involves deciding whether to stay or move to `p_x` based on which option maximizes the player's score over the `k` turns.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Simulate the game for the full `k` turns.
- For each turn, calculate the score for both staying and moving to `p_x` for each player.
- Choose the move that maximizes the score for each player.
- Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start):
            score = 0
            position = start
            for _ in range(k):
                score += a[position - 1]
                if a[p[position - 1] - 1] + score > a[position - 1] + score:
                    position = p[position - 1]
            return score
        
        bodya_score = simulate_game(pb)
        sasha_score = simulate_game(ps)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the game for the full `k` turns and correctly implements the optimal strategy for each player by comparing the scores of staying and moving to `p_x` at each turn.
