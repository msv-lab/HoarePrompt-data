The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` representing arrows in a grid. The function evaluates each test case to determine if it is possible to reach the second row from the first row by moving along the arrows. It returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the second row can be reached from the first row for the corresponding test case, or 'NO' otherwise. The input parameters `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.
