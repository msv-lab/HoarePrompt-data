### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `kreker` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `kreker` times, calling the function `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, the program reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - The program then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower.
   - After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer between `0` and `n` (inclusive), depending on the sequence of moves.
   - Therefore, it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower if and only if `m` is within the range `[0, n]`.

4. **Program Logic:**
   - The program checks if `n >= m`, which is a correct condition because if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower by adding `m` cubes in `m` moves and doing nothing in the remaining `n - m` moves.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `m` is greater than `n`, which should also result in "No".

5. **Test Cases:**
   - For the test case `3 3`, the program correctly prints "Yes" because `n` is equal to `m`.
   - For the test case `2 4`, the program correctly prints "No" because `n` is less than `m`.
   - For the test case `5 3`, the program correctly prints "Yes" because `n` is greater than `m`.

6. **Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `kreker` times and calling `func_1()` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is correct for the given problem. It correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves by checking if `n >= m`. The program also handles multiple test cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
