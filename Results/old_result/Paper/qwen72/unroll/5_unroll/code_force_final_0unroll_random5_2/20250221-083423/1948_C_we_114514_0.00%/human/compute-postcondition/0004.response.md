The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains:
  - An integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even), representing the length of the strings.
  - Two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

The function returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>'. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row for each test case.**
