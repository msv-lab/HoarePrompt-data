### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - The string `s` represents an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - We need to split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as \( p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m \).

2. **Optimal Splitting Strategy:**
   - To minimize the penalty, we should try to split the array in such a way that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - If the sum of a subarray is zero, its penalty is zero.
   - If the sum of a subarray is non-zero, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum multiplied by the length of the subarray.

3. **Analyzing the Annotated Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then splits the string `expression` by the character `-` to get parts.
   - The variable `result_length` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of these parts, but this is not used in the function `func_1`.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression` and maintains a `balance` variable.
   - The `balance` variable is incremented for `+` and decremented for `-`.
   - If the `balance` goes below zero, it is reset to zero, and a `count` is incremented.
   - The function returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which means:
     - `count` is the number of times the balance went below zero.
     - `(balance > 0)` is 1 if the final balance is positive, and 0 otherwise.

5. **Evaluating the Correctness:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which corresponds to the number of subarrays that need to be split to avoid negative balances.
   - The final balance check `(balance > 0)` ensures that if there is a remaining positive balance, it is counted as an additional subarray.
   - This approach ensures that the total penalty is minimized by splitting the array at points where the balance goes below zero and accounting for any remaining positive balance.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
