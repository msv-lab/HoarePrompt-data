Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B', `inpstr` is the input string, `ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0.**

The code initializes `ind2` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `s`, `inpstr`, and `ind1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition of `ind2` being 0.
