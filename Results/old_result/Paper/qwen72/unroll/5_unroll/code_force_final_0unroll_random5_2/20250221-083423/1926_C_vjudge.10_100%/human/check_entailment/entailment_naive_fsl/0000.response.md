Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores these sums in an array. For each test case, it reads the input value and prints the precomputed sum for that value. This approach ensures that the program can handle up to \(10^4\) test cases efficiently within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation step is done in \(O(n)\) time, and each test case is handled in \(O(1)\) time, which is efficient enough for the given constraints.
