Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the given list to form a non-degenerate triangle. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - **Three Sticks of the Same Length**: If a particular length appears at least 3 times, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - **Two Sticks of the Same Length and One Different**: If a particular length appears at least 2 times, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times \text{total_count} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times \text{total_count} \), where `total_count` is the total number of sticks processed so far.

4. **Updating Total Count**: The `total_count` is updated to include the current count of sticks.

5. **Output**: The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed at the end.

This approach ensures that all possible combinations of sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle are counted correctly. The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
