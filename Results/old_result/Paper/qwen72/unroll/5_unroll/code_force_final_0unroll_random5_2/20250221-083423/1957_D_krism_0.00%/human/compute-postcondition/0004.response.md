The only objects in the loop head are the variable `v` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element), the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `v` is not yet defined, but it will be assigned the first element of `arr` during the first iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must have at least one element, and `v` will be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Each `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `n` is an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least one element. `prefix` is a list containing the single element 0. `v` is the first element of `arr`.**
