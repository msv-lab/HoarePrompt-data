The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in the function signature. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function likely processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` (1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18), and returns a result for each test case. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).**
