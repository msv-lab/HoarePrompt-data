Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the field and entities (goals, players, Quaffle, Bludger) based on the input. It reads the dimensions of the field (N, M) and the initial state of the field, storing the positions of goals, the Quaffle, the Bludger, and players in appropriate data structures.

2. **Action Handling**: The program processes each action in the game. It correctly handles the following actions:
   - **Catching the Quaffle**: The player who catches the Quaffle is stored in the `carry` variable.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle**: The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the `carry` variable and moves the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
   - **Moving Entities**: The `func_1` function is used to move the Quaffle, Bludger, and players. It correctly updates the positions based on the direction provided, ensuring that the entities do not move outside the field boundaries.
   - **Elimination by Bludger**: The `func_2` function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger and eliminates them if so. It prints the elimination event and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate that they are out of the game.

3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the events (goals and eliminations) in the required format and order. At the end of the game, it prints the final score.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as:
   - Players moving the Quaffle and scoring in the wrong goal.
   - Multiple players being eliminated by the Bludger in the same step.
   - The Quaffle and Bludger moving independently of players.

5. **Boundary Conditions**: The program ensures that entities do not move outside the field boundaries by using the `func_1` function, which correctly updates the positions within the valid range.

6. **Correctness of `func_1` and `func_2`**:
   - **`func_1`**: The function correctly updates the position of the entity based on the direction. It handles all four directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and ensures that the entity does not move outside the field.
   - **`func_2`**: The function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger. It prints the elimination events in the correct order and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and requirements of the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
