The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (with `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`). It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case, and the loop counter `i` will be `t-1`. All other variables that were part of the initial state but not modified within the function will remain unchanged.
