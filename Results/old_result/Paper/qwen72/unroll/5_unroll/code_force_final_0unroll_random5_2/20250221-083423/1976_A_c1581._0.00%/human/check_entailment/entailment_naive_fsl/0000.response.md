Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly verifies the strong password conditions as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Condition 1: Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
   - The program implicitly checks this condition by using the `isdigit()` and the `else` block, which only processes lowercase letters. If any character is not a digit or a lowercase letter, it will not be processed, and the program will not fail because it only checks the sorting and order of digits and letters.

2. **Condition 2: There should be no digit that comes after a letter.**
   - The program correctly implements this condition by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable. If a digit is found, it updates this index. If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), the function returns 'NO'.

3. **Condition 3: All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks this by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'.

4. **Condition 4: All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks this by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'.

The program processes the input correctly, handling multiple test cases and ensuring that all the conditions are met for each password. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
