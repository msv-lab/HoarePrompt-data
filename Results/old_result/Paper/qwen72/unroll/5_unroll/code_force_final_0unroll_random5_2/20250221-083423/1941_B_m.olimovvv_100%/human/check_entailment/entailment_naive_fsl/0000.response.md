Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array elements cannot be reduced to zero using the described operations. Specifically, the program does not correctly check if the final two elements of the array are zero after attempting to apply the operations. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this input, even though it is possible to make all elements zero as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the logic used to reduce the elements and check if they are zero. The program does not correctly propagate the changes through the array and does not handle the edge cases properly.
