### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and reducing the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list from index 0 to \( n-1 \) are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is straightforward and correct for its purpose.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the specified operation.
   - The loop iterates over indices from 1 to \( n-2 \) (inclusive).
   - For each index \( i \), it performs the operation as long as the conditions \( \text{list}[i] > 1 \), \( \text{list}[i-1] > 0 \), and \( \text{list}[i+1] > 0 \) are met.
   - If at any point \( \text{list}[i-1] \) is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns, indicating that it's not possible to make all elements zero.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Issues in `func_2`**:
   - The operation performed in the while loop is incorrect. The loop should reduce the elements by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, but the current implementation reduces \( \text{list}[i] \) by \( 2 \times \text{list}[i-1] \) and \( \text{list}[i+1] \) by \( \text{list}[i-1] \). This is not the correct operation as described in the problem.
   - The condition `if list[i - 1] != 0` is not appropriate. The function should check if the entire list can be reduced to zero, not just the elements from index 0 to \( n-2 \).

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - The function should check if the entire list can be reduced to zero, not just a part of it.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not performed as described in the problem, and the condition to check if the list can be reduced to zero is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
