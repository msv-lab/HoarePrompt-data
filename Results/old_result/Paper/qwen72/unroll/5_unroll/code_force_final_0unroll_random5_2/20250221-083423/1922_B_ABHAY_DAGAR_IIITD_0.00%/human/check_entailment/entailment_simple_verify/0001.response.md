### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent `a_i`. This is a correct approach to keep track of the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will store the cumulative count of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique stick length `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) and adds this to `res`. This is correct because if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
     - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplies it by `total_count` (the number of sticks processed so far). This is incorrect because it does not account for the triangle inequality theorem correctly. Specifically, for sticks of lengths \(2^a\), \(2^a\), and \(2^b\) (where \(a \neq b\)), the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks \(2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}\) is not greater than the length of the longer stick \(2^b\) unless \(b = a+1\). However, the program does not check this condition and simply multiplies the combinations by `total_count`, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the result `res` to the `results` list for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `results` list.

### Analysis:
- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle with sticks of lengths \(2^a\) is if all three sticks have the same length. However, it incorrectly calculates the number of ways to form triangles when two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length.

- **Combination Calculations:**
  - The combination formula for choosing 3 sticks of the same length is correct.
  - The combination formula for choosing 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length is incorrect because it does not consider the triangle inequality theorem.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where `n` is 1 or 2 by not forming any triangles.
  - It also correctly handles cases where all sticks have different lengths by outputting 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles when all three sticks have the same length. However, it incorrectly counts the number of ways to form triangles when two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length. This leads to incorrect results in some cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where two sticks have the same length and one stick has a different length, ensuring that the triangle inequality theorem is satisfied.
