def func_1():

    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user through the `putin()` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user through the `putin()` function. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned an integer value provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function does not take any parameters.

    #The program returns an iterator that will convert the input string from the `putin()` function into a sequence of integers, where the input string is split by whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It returns an iterator that converts the input string from the `putin()` function into a sequence of integers, where the input string is split by whitespace.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar and sec_arr are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The integers in the tuples represent the price differences for items (main_ar) or the prices for items (sec_arr) that are relevant to the calculation of Alice's profit.

            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `main_ar` remains unchanged, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns the value of `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` plus the sum of the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements is greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, both of which are lists of tuples containing two integers. It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr` and adds to this sum the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this final sum, leaving `main_ar` and `sec_arr` unchanged.
