Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by the number of containers, but the amounts cannot be equalized by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if the cumulative difference between the current amount and the mean is non-negative at any point, the water can be equalized. However, this is not always true.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
1 2 3 6
```

The mean amount of water is `(1 + 2 + 3 + 6) // 4 = 3`. The program will calculate the cumulative difference as follows:
- For `i = 0`: `curr += 1 - 3 = -2` (returns 'NO' immediately)

However, it is possible to equalize the water in this case by performing the following operations:
- Pour 2 units from the 4th container to the 1st container: `[3, 2, 3, 4]`
- Pour 1 unit from the 4th container to the 2nd container: `[3, 3, 3, 3]`

Thus, the correct output should be 'YES', but the program outputs 'NO'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
