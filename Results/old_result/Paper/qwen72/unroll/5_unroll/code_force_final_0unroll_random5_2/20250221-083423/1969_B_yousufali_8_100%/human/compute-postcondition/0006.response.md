Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `s` is the input string.
- `n` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.
- `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is not at the beginning of the string and is preceded by at least one '1'.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Count the '1's in the string `s`:**
   - `n` is the number of '1's in the string `s`.

2. **Identify the '0's in the string `s` that meet the criteria:**
   - We need to find each '0' in the string `s` that is not at the beginning of the string and is preceded by at least one '1'.
   - For each such '0', we add `n + 1` to `ans`.

3. **Calculate `ans`:**
   - Initialize `ans` to 0.
   - Iterate through the string `s` starting from the second character (since the first character cannot be preceded by a '1').
   - For each character, check if it is '0' and if the previous character is '1'.
   - If both conditions are met, add `n + 1` to `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example input string `s = "101010"` to illustrate the calculation:
- `n` (number of '1's) = 3
- Iterate through `s` starting from the second character:
  - `s[1] = '0'` and `s[0] = '1'` → Add `n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
  - `s[3] = '0'` and `s[2] = '1'` → Add `n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
  - `s[5] = '0'` and `s[4] = '1'` → Add `n + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4` to `ans`.
- `ans` = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12

### General Description:
- The value of `ans` depends on the number of '0's in the string `s` that are not at the beginning and are preceded by at least one '1'.
- Each such '0' contributes `n + 1` to `ans`, where `n` is the total number of '1's in the string `s`.

### Final Output:
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each '0' in the string s that is not at the beginning of the string and is preceded by at least one '1', and n is the number of '1's in the string s)**
