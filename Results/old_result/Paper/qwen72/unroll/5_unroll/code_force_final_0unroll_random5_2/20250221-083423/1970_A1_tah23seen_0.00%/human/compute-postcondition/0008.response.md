The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `j`, and the list `d`. For the loop to execute, the list `d` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `i` and `j` will be assigned the first tuple's values in the list `d` at the start of the loop.

State: **`ans` is an empty string, `d` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `i` is the position from the first tuple in `d`, `j` is the depth from the first tuple in `d`**
