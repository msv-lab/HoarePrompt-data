### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Parsing Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players.
   - It initializes a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map movement commands to coordinate changes.
   - It calculates the middle of the field using the formula `((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)`.
   - It initializes the `quidditch` list to store the position of the Quaffle and the player carrying it.
   - It reads the initial field configuration and correctly populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries, as well as the initial position of the Quaffle.

2. **Processing Moves:**
   - The program reads the number of moves `moves`.
   - It iterates through each move and processes it based on the action type.
   - For movement actions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the player's position using the `func_1` function.
   - It checks if the player moves into the same cell as a Bludger and prints an elimination event if so.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of the player carrying the Quaffle and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - For catching actions (`C`), it updates the Quaffle's carrier.
   - For throwing actions (`T`), it resets the Quaffle's carrier and checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal.
   - It correctly prints the goal event and updates the score.
   - It resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if a goal is scored.

3. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the movement command.

### Issues:
- **Catching the Quaffle:**
  - The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly update the Quaffle's carrier.

- **Throwing the Quaffle:**
  - The program incorrectly updates the Quaffle's position when a goal is scored. It should always reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field, regardless of the team that scored.
  - The line `quidditch[0] = players[mo[0]]` should be `quidditch[0] = middle` in both cases where a goal is scored.

- **Bludger Elimination:**
  - The program checks if a player is eliminated by a Bludger, but it does not handle the case where the Bludger is moved. The Bludger's position should be updated in the `players` dictionary if it is moved.
  - The program should also handle the case where the Bludger moves into a player's position.

### Corrected Program:
```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)

# Read the initial field configuration
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

# Process the moves
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
        if '.B' in players:
            bludger_pos = players['.B']
            for (k, v) in players.items():
                if k != '.B' and v == bludger_pos:
                    print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                    if quidditch[1] == k:
                        quidditch = [bludger_pos, '']
                    del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        quidditch[1] = ''
        if players[mo[0]] in goals['R']:
            pointsb += 1
            print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle
        elif players[mo[0]] in goals['B']:
            pointsr += 1
            print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quidditch[0] = middle

# Print the final score
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)

def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program has issues with handling the catching and throwing of the Quaffle, as well as the movement and elimination of players by the Bludger. These issues need to be corrected to ensure the program functions as intended.
