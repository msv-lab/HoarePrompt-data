The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input format, but the function definition provided does not include parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `X` for each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function should handle these inputs to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists.
