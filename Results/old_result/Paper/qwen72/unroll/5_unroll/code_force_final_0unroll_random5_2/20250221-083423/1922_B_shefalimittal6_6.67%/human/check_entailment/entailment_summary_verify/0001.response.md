### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is done efficiently using a loop and the `get` method.

3. **Triangle Formation Conditions:**
   - The problem states that the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, and a non-degenerate triangle can only be formed if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given that the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length. This is because the sum of two smaller powers of 2 will never be greater than the next higher power of 2 (e.g., \(2^1 + 2^1 = 2^2\), but \(2^1 + 2^1 \leq 2^2\)).

4. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `math.comb(cnt, 3)` where `cnt` is the count of sticks of a particular length.
   - However, the program also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the counts of all other stick lengths. This part is incorrect because choosing 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length will not form a non-degenerate triangle. For example, if you have two sticks of length \(2^1\) and one stick of length \(2^2\), the sum of the lengths of the two shorter sticks is \(2^1 + 2^1 = 2^2\), which is not greater than the length of the longer stick.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of valid combinations of 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - Due to the incorrect combination calculation for the "2 same, 1 different" scenario, the output will be incorrect for test cases where there are sticks of different lengths.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Correctness of the Triangle Formation Logic:**
  - The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length.
  - However, it incorrectly includes the "2 same, 1 different" scenario in the combination count, which should not be included.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
  - The combination calculations are performed using the `math.comb` function, which is efficient for the given constraints.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by not adding any combinations to the result.
  - It also handles the case where there are no sticks of the same length correctly by not adding any combinations to the result.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically incorrect because it includes invalid combinations (2 same, 1 different) in the count of non-degenerate triangles. This leads to incorrect results for test cases where there are sticks of different lengths.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
