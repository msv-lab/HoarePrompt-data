Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program contains a logic error in the way it handles the calculation of the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program uses a fixed limit of `j > 1000` to break out of the loop, which is not mentioned in the problem description and can lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, if the input contains more than 1000 different values for `a_i`, the program will prematurely terminate the loop and might miss counting valid triangles.

Here's a specific test case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
1001
1 2 3 4 ... 1001

Output (Expected):
0

Output (Actual):
Incorrect output due to the loop breaking prematurely
```

In this case, the program will not correctly count the number of ways to form a triangle because the loop will break before processing all the unique values in the input.
