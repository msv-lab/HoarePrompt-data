Correctness: **False**.

Explanation of the incorrectness:
The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the logic for updating the sum `s` in the loop is flawed. The program incorrectly updates the sum `s` by adding `c * i * c * m + c * a` in each iteration, which does not reflect the correct expected value calculation.

The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in the friendship value for each excursion and then summing these expected values over k excursions. The expected value for a single excursion is the sum of the current friendship values of all pairs, plus the probability of choosing a friend pair and increasing its value by 1.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the correct approach:
1. Calculate the probability `c` of choosing any specific pair of children.
2. Initialize the sum of friendship values `a` for all friend pairs.
3. For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is `c * a` (the current sum of friendship values) plus `c * m` (the probability of choosing a friend pair and increasing its value by 1).
4. Update the sum of friendship values `a` for the next excursion by adding `c * m` to `a`.

The given program does not follow this logic correctly, leading to incorrect results for some cases. For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
The expected output should be `40000020`, but the given program will produce a different result due to the incorrect update logic.
