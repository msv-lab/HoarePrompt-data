The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines each containing `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input, and the sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the given output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each test case.**
