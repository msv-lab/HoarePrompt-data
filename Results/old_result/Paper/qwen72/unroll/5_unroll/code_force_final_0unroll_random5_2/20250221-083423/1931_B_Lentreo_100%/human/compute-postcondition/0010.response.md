The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list (`len(nums)`). The function returns 'NO' in one case and 'YES' in another case. 

To describe the functionality step by step:
1. The function accepts a list of integers `nums`.
2. The sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`.
3. If a certain condition is met, the function returns 'NO'.
4. If the condition is not met, the function returns 'YES'.

Since the specific condition for each case is not provided, we can only describe the general behavior based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. It returns 'NO' in one case and 'YES' in another case, based on some internal condition.**
