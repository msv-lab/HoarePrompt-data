You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. It then compares these integers and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and prints 'No' if `n` is less than `m`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed result ('Yes' or 'No') based on the comparison of `n` and `m`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the number of cubes, but it does not account for the fact that Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time. For the program to be correct, it should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because if `n - m` is even, it means Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by alternating between adding and removing cubes.

For example, consider the test case `2 1`:
- According to the problem, Nikita can achieve a tower with 1 cube after 2 moves by adding a cube and then removing it, and then adding it again.
- However, the program will output "No" because `n` (2) is not greater than or equal to `m` (1), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
