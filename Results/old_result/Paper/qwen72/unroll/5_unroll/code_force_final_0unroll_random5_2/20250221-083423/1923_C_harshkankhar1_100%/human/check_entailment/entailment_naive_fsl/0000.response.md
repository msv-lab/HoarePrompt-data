Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all elements in the subarray are 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `b` is equal to the sum of elements in the subarray of `c`, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray of `c` and greater than 0. If the subarray consists entirely of 1s, it is impossible to construct such an array `b` because any positive integer different from 1 would change the sum. However, the current program will output "YES" for such subarrays, which is incorrect.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5 3
1 1 1 1 1
1 5
2 4
3 3
```
Expected output:
```
NO
NO
NO
```
Actual output from the program:
```
YES
YES
NO
```
