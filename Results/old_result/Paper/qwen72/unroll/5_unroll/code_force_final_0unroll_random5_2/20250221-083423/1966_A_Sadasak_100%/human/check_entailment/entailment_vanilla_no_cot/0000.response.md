Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` is intended to create a frequency table of the numbers in the hand, but it limits the frequency of any number to `k`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

The main issue is in the logic used to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations. The program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency table and prints `k - 1` if it is, otherwise it prints `n`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual operations that can be performed to reduce the number of cards.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Counting the frequency of each number in the hand.
2. For each number, determining how many full exchanges can be made and how many cards will remain.
3. Summing the remaining cards after all possible exchanges to get the minimum number of cards left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums)
        min_cards = sum((f % (k-1) + (k-1) if f % (k-1) != 0 else 0 for f in freq.values()))
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

This corrected version:
1. Counts the frequency of each number without limiting it to `k`.
2. Calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the remainder of the frequency divided by `k-1` and adding `k-1` if the remainder is non-zero. This ensures that we account for the cards that cannot be fully exchanged.

This approach correctly handles the problem and should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
