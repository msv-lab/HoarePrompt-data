Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks the difference between the current element and the last element in the list, which is not sufficient to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers by the given operation.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the average amount of water. The key insight is that if the sum of the water amounts is divisible by the number of containers, and if no container has less water than the average, then it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount of water. However, the program does not implement this logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        avg = total // n  # Since total is divisible by n, avg will be an integer
        
        # Check if any container has less water than the average
        if min(nums) < avg:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program calculates the average amount of water each container should have and checks if any container has less water than this average. If any container has less water than the average, it is impossible to redistribute the water as required, and the program outputs "NO". Otherwise, it outputs "YES". This approach correctly determines the possibility of making the amount of water in all containers the same.
