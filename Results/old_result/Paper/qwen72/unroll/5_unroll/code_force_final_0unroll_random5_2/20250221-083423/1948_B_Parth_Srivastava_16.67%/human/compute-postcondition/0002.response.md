Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer, `n` is the length of the list `a` (where 2 <= n <= 50 and 0 <= a_i <= 99 for all 0 <= i < n).**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the input value `a` into a list of integers by splitting the input string on whitespace and converting each part to an integer. The length of the list `a` remains `n`, and the values of `a_i` are still within the specified range. The variable `k` and the condition for `n` remain unchanged.
