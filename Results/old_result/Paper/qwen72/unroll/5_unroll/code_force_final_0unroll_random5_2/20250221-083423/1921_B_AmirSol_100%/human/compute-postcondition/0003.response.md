The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1' characters. The function returns the maximum value between `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`, where `cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', and `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1' characters. It returns the maximum number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, either with `s1[i]` being '0' and `s2[i]` being '1', or with `s1[i]` being '1' and `s2[i]` being '0'.**
