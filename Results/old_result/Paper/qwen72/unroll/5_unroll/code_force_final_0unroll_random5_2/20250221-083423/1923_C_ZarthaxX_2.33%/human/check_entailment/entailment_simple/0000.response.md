### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and initializes two lists: `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The `ones` list is used to store the cumulative count of 1s in the array `c`.
   - The `sum` list is used to store the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `c` and 1.
   - Both lists are initialized with an extra element at the beginning to handle 1-based indexing.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the subarray boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - If `l` equals `r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no valid `b_i` that satisfies all conditions (specifically, `a_i \neq b_i` and `b_i > 0`).
   - The program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the differences in the subarray using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition ensures that the sum of the differences is sufficient to allow for a valid `b` array where each `b_i` is different from `a_i` and positive.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The preprocessing step efficiently calculates the necessary cumulative values, and the query processing step correctly applies the conditions to determine the result for each query.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
