### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. This is done using `map(int, input().split())`, which is appropriate for splitting the input and converting the values to integers.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct and will print "STAIR" if true.
   - It then checks if `a == b == c` to determine if all digits are the same. This condition is also correct and will print "NONE" if true.
   - Next, it checks if `b` is the maximum of the three digits using `max(a, b, c) == b`. This condition is intended to identify a peak, but it is not entirely correct. A peak is defined as `a < b > c`, not just `b` being the maximum. For example, if `a = 5`, `b = 5`, and `c = 3`, the condition `max(a, b, c) == b` will be true, but it should not print "PEAK" because `a` is not less than `b`.
   - The else condition correctly handles all other cases, which should be "NONE".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The condition `a < b < c` correctly identifies a stair.
   - The condition `a == b == c` correctly identifies when all digits are the same, which should be "NONE".
   - The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is incorrect because it does not fully capture the peak condition `a < b > c`. It will incorrectly identify cases where `a` and `b` are equal as peaks.
   - The else condition correctly handles all other cases, which should be "NONE".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`).
   - It also handles cases where `b` is not the maximum but the digits do not form a stair (e.g., `4 1 7`).
   - However, it fails to handle cases where `a` and `b` are equal but `b` is greater than `c` (e.g., `5 5 3`), which should be "NONE" but will incorrectly be identified as "PEAK".

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the given digits form a peak. The condition `max(a, b, c) == b` is insufficient and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
