Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and composed of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns `True` if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
