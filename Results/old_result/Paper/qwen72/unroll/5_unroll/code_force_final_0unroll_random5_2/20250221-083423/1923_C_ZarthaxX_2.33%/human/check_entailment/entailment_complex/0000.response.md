### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two lists, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s and the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and 1, respectively.

2. **Cumulative Arrays:**
   - The `ones` array is correctly populated to store the cumulative count of 1s up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is correctly populated to store the cumulative sum of the differences between each element and 1 up to each index.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `nums[l-1:r]` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray is a single element, and the program correctly prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be changed to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.
   - For other subarrays, the program calculates the number of 1s in the subarray (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the differences between each element and 1 in the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition ensures that the sum of the differences between the elements and 1 in the subarray is sufficient to allow each element to be changed to a different positive integer while maintaining the sum.

4. **Correctness of the Condition:**
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` can be simplified to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition checks if the total number of 1s plus the length of the subarray (which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make all elements different from 1) is less than or equal to the sum of the differences between each element and 1 in the subarray.
   - If this condition is met, the subarray is good, and the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the subarray is a single element.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the subarray has multiple elements and checks the condition to determine if it is good.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly processes the input, calculates the necessary cumulative values, and applies the correct condition to determine if each subarray is good.

### Correctness:
**True**
