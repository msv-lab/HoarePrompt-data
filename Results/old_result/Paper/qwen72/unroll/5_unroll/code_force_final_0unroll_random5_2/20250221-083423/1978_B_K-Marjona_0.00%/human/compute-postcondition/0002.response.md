The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters: `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. The constraints are that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9.

Given these constraints, the function likely processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**
