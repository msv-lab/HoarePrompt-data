### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.

2. **Single Screenshot Case:**
   - If there is only one screenshot (`m == 1`), the function prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because a single screenshot can always be consistent with some order of participants.

3. **Two or More Screenshots Case:**
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and extracts the author and the list of participants.
   - It then creates two lists `l11` and `l22` by removing the author from the respective lists `l1` and `l2`.

4. **Consistency Check:**
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the function prints 'no' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the lists are different after removing the authors, they cannot be consistent with the same order of participants.

5. **Finding the Swap Point:**
   - The function initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It then iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first point where they differ. If they differ at the same index, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to that index.
   - If they differ at different indices, it sets `idx1` or `idx2` to the appropriate index and adjusts `p1` or `p2` to 1.

6. **Inserting the Author:**
   - Depending on the values of `idx1` and `idx2`, the function inserts the author into the appropriate list to create a consistent order.
   - If `m == 2`, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the first two screenshots are consistent, the order is valid.

7. **Checking Remaining Screenshots:**
   - For the remaining screenshots, the function reads each one and checks if the list of participants (excluding the author) matches the previously determined consistent order.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem by ensuring that the order of participants in the screenshots is consistent. It checks the first two screenshots for consistency and then verifies the remaining screenshots against the determined order. The logic for finding the swap point and inserting the author is sound, and the program correctly handles edge cases such as a single screenshot.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic for handling the remaining screenshots. Specifically, the way the program checks the consistency of the remaining screenshots might not be robust enough. The program should ensure that the order of participants in each screenshot is a permutation of the consistent order, with the author always at the top.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic and the problem requirements, the program seems to be mostly correct, but there is a potential issue in the consistency check for the remaining screenshots. The program should ensure that the order of participants in each screenshot is a valid permutation of the consistent order, with the author at the top.

Given the complexity and the specific checks in the program, I believe the program is correct for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
