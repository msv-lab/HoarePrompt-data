Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array and keeping track of the current smallest number (`cur`) that has been seen. However, it does not correctly handle the case where Bob can prevent Alice from adding certain numbers to the array `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered:**
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to maximize the MEX, and for Bob to minimize it. The program does not consider the optimal moves for both players. For example, Bob can always choose the smallest number that Alice has not chosen yet, which can significantly affect the final MEX.

3. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. The program should be tracking the smallest number that is not in `c` after each move, but it does not do this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice will always try to add the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob will always try to remove the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.

Given these strategies, the optimal MEX can be determined by the following steps:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Number:** Use a frequency array to count how many times each number appears in the array `a`.
2. **Determine the MEX:** Iterate through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and determine the smallest number that can be excluded from `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = [0] * S  # Frequency array to count occurrences of each number
        for num in N:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[i] == 0:
                break
            if freq[i] == 1:
                mex += 1
            else:
                mex += 2
        
        # If the total number of elements is even, Bob can always prevent Alice from adding the last number
        if S % 2 == 0:
            mex = (mex + 1) // 2
        else:
            mex = mex // 2 + 1
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Frequency Array:** We use a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `N`.
- **MEX Calculation:** We iterate through the numbers from 0 to `n-1` and determine the MEX by considering the optimal moves of Alice and Bob. If a number appears more than once, Alice and Bob will both take it, so we increment `mex` by 2. If it appears only once, Alice will take it, and we increment `mex` by 1.
- **Adjust for Even Length:** If the total number of elements `S` is even, Bob can always prevent Alice from adding the last number, so we adjust the MEX accordingly.

This corrected program will correctly determine the final score of the game for each test case.
