### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `s` and prints this difference as the output. However, this approach does not align with the problem's requirement to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a`.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty:**
   - The program calculates `P - M`, where `P` is the count of `+` and `M` is the count of `-`. This is not the penalty as defined in the problem. The penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays multiplied by their lengths.

2. **Lack of Optimal Splitting Logic:**
   - The program does not implement any logic to split the array `a` into subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` to minimize the total penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-`.

3. **Test Case Failures:**
   - The provided test cases clearly demonstrate that the program's output is incorrect:
     - For `"+-+-+-"`, the expected output is `0`, but the program outputs `2`.
     - For `"--+++++++-"`, the expected output is `4`, but the program outputs `6`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to implement a logic that optimally splits the array `a` to minimize the total penalty. One effective approach is to split the array at every point where the sum of the subarray becomes zero, as this will ensure that the penalty for that subarray is zero. If no such point exists, we need to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
