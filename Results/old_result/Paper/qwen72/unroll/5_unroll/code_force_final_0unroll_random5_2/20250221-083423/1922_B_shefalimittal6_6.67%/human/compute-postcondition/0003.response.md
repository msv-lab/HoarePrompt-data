The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each inner list in `cases` contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the output for each test case in `cases`. The specific output for each test case is not provided, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the contents of the inner lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains `n` integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to the output for a test case in `cases`.**
