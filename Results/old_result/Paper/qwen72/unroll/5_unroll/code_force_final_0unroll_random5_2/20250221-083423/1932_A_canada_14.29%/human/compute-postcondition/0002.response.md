The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `path`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and `path` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either '.', '@', or '*', and the first character is '.'. The function returns a value based on the processing of these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `path`. It returns a value based on the processing of these parameters, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, and `path` is a string of `n` characters starting with '.' and containing only '.', '@', or '*'.**
