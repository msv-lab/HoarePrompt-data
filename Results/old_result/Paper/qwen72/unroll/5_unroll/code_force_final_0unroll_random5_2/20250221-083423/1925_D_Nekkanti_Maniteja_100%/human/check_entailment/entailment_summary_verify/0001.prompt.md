You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the number of children (`n`), the number of pairs of friends (`m`), and the number of excursions (`k`). It then prints the result of this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` retain their values, and the variable `a` holds the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus used for the final answer.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs randomly and equiprobably.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `f` for all pairs of friends and stores this sum in `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum:**
   - The program iterates over each excursion and calculates the expected increase in the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected increase for each excursion is given by the sum of the initial friendship values `a` and the sum of the friendship values of the pairs chosen in previous excursions.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is used to calculate the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions. This is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the cumulative effect of the friendship values increasing over multiple excursions.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the final result is within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly initializes the variables and reads the input.
- The calculation of the modular inverse `c` is correct.
- The summation of initial friendship values `a` is correct.
- However, the way the expected sum is calculated in the loop is incorrect. The term `c * i * c * m` does not correctly represent the expected increase in friendship values over multiple excursions. The correct approach should involve a more accurate calculation of the expected value, considering the cumulative effect of the friendship values.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be calculated using the linearity of expectation.
- For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values `a` plus the expected increase due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions.
- The expected increase due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions can be calculated as the sum of the friendship values of all pairs chosen in previous excursions, divided by the total number of possible pairs.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        
        expected_sum = 0
        for i in range(k):
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + a) % M
            a = (a + c * m * i) % M
        
        print(expected_sum)

```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of the expected sum.
- The corrected program accurately calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions.

Correctness: **False**
