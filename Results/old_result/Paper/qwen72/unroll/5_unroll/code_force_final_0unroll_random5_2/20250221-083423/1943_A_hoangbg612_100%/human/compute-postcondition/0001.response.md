The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used in the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

State: **`T` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable**
