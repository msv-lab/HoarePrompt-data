The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it reads the grid and checks specific conditions on the first and last rows and columns. If the first row or last row contains only one unique character and they are not the same, or if the first column or last column contains only one unique character and they are not the same, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
