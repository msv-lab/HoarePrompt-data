Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of an array `S` and the array `N` itself, sorts the array, and processes it to determine a value `cur`. The value of `cur` is then printed for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly. The variables `S`, `N`, and `M` are reset for each test case, and the final state of `cur` depends on the input for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function completes and no further state is retained. **
