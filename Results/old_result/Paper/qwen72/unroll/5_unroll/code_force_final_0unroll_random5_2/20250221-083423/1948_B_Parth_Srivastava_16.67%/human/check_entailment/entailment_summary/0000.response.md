Reasoning:  
The program's logic for determining if an array can be sorted by splitting elements greater than 10 into their digits and checking if the resulting array is sorted is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks if the final array `c` is sorted after processing the input array `a` once, which is insufficient. The operation can be applied multiple times, and the program should consider all possible transformations to determine if the array can be sorted.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where an element greater than 10 is at the end of the array, and it does not correctly manage the insertion of digits in the array. The logic for splitting and inserting digits is also overly complex and could be simplified.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation until no more elements can be split.
2. Ensure that the digits are inserted in the correct order and that the array is checked for sorted order after each operation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
