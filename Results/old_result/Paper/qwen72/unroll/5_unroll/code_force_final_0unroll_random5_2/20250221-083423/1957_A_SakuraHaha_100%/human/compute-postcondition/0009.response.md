To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ans` is the sum of the integer division of each value in `cnt` by 3.
   - `cnt`, `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `cnt` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is calculated by taking each element in `cnt`, performing integer division by 3, and summing the results.

3. **Calculation of `ans`**:
   - For each element `x` in `cnt`, the integer division `x // 3` is performed.
   - The results of these divisions are summed to get `ans`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of each element in `cnt` by 3.

Since the exact values of `cnt` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the given information, we can describe the value of `ans` precisely.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the integer division of each value in cnt by 3)**
