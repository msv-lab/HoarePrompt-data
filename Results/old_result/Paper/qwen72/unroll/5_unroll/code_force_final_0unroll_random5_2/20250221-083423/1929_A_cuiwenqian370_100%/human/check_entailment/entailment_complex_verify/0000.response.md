Reasoning:

The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it calculates the beauty using the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, rather than the sum of the differences without the absolute value. However, this assessment is based on a misunderstanding of the problem description.

The problem description states that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). This implies that the differences can be negative, and the sum of these differences is what should be maximized. However, the key to maximizing the beauty is to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. Sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements is actually a valid approach to maximize the beauty, because:

1. **Sorting in Ascending Order**: When the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are always non-negative. This ensures that the sum of these differences is maximized, as the largest elements are always subtracted from the smallest elements in a sequential manner.

2. **Absolute Differences**: The use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` in `func_1` is not incorrect in this context. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, `array[i]` is always greater than or equal to `array[i - 1]`, making `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` equivalent to `array[i] - array[i - 1]`.

3. **Counterexample Analysis**: The original assessment provides a counterexample with the input `3\n3\n3 2 1`. However, for this input, sorting the array in ascending order results in `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is calculated as \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\), which is the correct and maximum beauty for this array.

4. **General Case**: For any array, sorting in ascending order and then summing the differences between consecutive elements will always yield the maximum possible beauty, as it ensures that the largest positive differences are included in the sum.

Given this reasoning, the program as written is correct and follows the problem description. The original assessment is inaccurate because it misinterprets the problem requirements and the behavior of the program.

Final: **True**
