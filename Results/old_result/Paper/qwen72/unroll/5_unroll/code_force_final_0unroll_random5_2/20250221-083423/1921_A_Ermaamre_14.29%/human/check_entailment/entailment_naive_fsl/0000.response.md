Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the given problem. Specifically, the program assumes a fixed order of the coordinates being input, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The problem states that the coordinates of the corners are given in random order, but the program only checks a few specific permutations of these coordinates. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
The program will not correctly compute the area because it does not account for the possibility that the coordinates might not match the specific conditions it checks (i.e., `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`, `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`, or `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`). A correct solution would need to identify the side length of the square regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
