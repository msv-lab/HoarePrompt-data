Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an array `c` of length `n` and processes `q` queries. Each query consists of two indices `l_i` and `r_i` that define a subarray of `c`. The function calculates and prints 'YES' if the subarray is "good" based on the condition that the sum of the subarray elements in `c` is not less than the sum of a transformed subarray where each element is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element in `c` is greater than 1, 2 otherwise). If the condition is not met or if `l_i` equals `r_i`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. **
