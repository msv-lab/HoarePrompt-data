Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array `a` is 2, and when it is not 2. However, the problem requires a more general solution that can handle any array of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 18`) and maximize the sum of the elements by performing the specified operations.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input and converts the string of space-separated numbers into a list of integers. However, it does not handle the input in a way that is useful for the problem's requirements.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a`, but the function itself does not use the array `a` at all. Instead, it uses the variable `c`, which is the length of the array.
   - The function only checks if the length of the array is 2. If it is, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which is correct for the specific example where the array is `[0, 1]`. However, this does not generalize to other arrays of length 2, nor does it handle arrays of other lengths.
   - If the length of the array is not 2, it prints `13 0`, which is only correct for the specific example where the array is `[1, 3, 9]`. This does not generalize to other arrays of length 3 or any other length.

3. **Output**:
   - The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.
   - The program does not return any value, which is not a requirement but is a sign that the function is incomplete.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the general problem statement. It only works for two specific examples and fails to handle other cases.

Correctness: **False**
