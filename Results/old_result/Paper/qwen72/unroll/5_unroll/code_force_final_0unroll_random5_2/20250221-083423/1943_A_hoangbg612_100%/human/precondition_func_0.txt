The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, and `a` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4), `n` is the size of the array `a` for each test case (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) for each test case. Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.
