To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `iterable` and `loop`. The loop will execute if `loop` is greater than 0. The variable `iterable` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each of the n lines contains two integers a and x, where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, representing the type of constraint and the value x, respectively.
- It is guaranteed that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the exact same.
- `loop` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute:
- `loop` must be greater than 0.
- `iterable` will start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, each test case contains constraints with types a in {1, 2, 3} and values x such that 1 <= x <= 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
