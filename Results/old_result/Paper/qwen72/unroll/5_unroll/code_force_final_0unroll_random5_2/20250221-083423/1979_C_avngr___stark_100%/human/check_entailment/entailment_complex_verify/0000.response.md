Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem description to see if the program meets the requirements.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: Multiple test cases, each with a list of multipliers `k_i` for the outcomes.
2. **Output**: For each test case, output a list of bets `x_i` such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. If no such distribution exists, output `-1`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM is calculated as `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`, which is correct for positive integers.

2. **Function `func_2(numbers)`**:
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of positive integers `numbers`.
   - It initializes `result` with the first element of the list and then iteratively applies `func_1` to `result` and each subsequent element of the list.
   - The final `result` is the LCM of all elements in the list.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
   - It computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2(k)`.
   - It then computes the bets `c` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - It checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- **LCM Calculation**:
  - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a common multiple of the multipliers.
  - This is a valid approach because the LCM ensures that the bets are scaled appropriately to meet the problem's requirements.

- **Bet Calculation**:
  - The bets `c[i]` are calculated as `m // k[i]`, which means each bet is a fraction of the LCM.
  - This ensures that the return for each winning outcome is `k_i * c[i] = k_i * (m // k_i) = m`, which is the LCM.

- **Sum Check**:
  - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`.
  - If `sum(c) < m`, then the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirements.
  - If `sum(c) >= m`, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution exists.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `3 3 2 7`
  - LCM of `3, 2, 7` is `42`.
  - Bets: `c = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`.
  - Sum of bets: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`.
  - Since `41 < 42`, the program outputs `14 21 6`, which is a valid solution.

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `2 3 3`
  - LCM of `3, 3` is `3`.
  - Bets: `c = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`.
  - Sum of bets: `1 + 1 = 2`.
  - Since `2 < 3`, the program outputs `1 1`, which is a valid solution.

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `5 5 5 5 5 5`
  - LCM of `5, 5, 5, 5, 5` is `5`.
  - Bets: `c = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
  - Sum of bets: `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
  - Since `5 >= 5`, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct because no valid distribution exists.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description by ensuring that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The use of the LCM and the sum check are appropriate and meet the requirements of the problem.

Final: **True**
