Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The program attempts to perform a binary search, but it does not handle the permutation correctly. The binary search is designed for sorted arrays, and the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted. The program does not sort the permutation or perform the necessary swaps to ensure the permutation is in a state where binary search can be applied correctly.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not implement the logic to perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation before running the binary search. The swaps are crucial to ensure that the binary search can find the correct element.

3. **Input and Output Handling**: The program uses functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to read input, but these functions are not integrated correctly into the main logic of the program. The input is read, but the necessary operations to solve the problem are not performed.

4. **Correctness of Binary Search**: The binary search logic itself is flawed. The `seen` array is used to track which elements have been visited, but it is not necessary for the binary search algorithm. The program should focus on finding the correct position for `x` in the permutation, which requires sorting or appropriate swaps.

5. **Output Format**: The program does not follow the specified output format. It should output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to swap, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
