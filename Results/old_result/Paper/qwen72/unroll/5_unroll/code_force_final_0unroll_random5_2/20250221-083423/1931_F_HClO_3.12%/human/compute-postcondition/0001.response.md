The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the range is determined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable**
