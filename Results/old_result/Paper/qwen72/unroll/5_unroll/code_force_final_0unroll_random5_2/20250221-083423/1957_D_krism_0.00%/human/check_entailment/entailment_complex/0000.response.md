### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Call:**
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop that iterates `T` times, where `T` is the number of test cases. However, the function `func_1` is not defined with parameters to handle the test cases. This is a critical issue because the function needs to process each test case independently.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `prefix` is correctly calculated. The array `prefix` contains the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr`, starting with 0. This is necessary for efficiently computing the XOR of subarrays.

3. **Bit Count Arrays:**
   - The arrays `pre` and `suf` are intended to keep track of the counts of elements in `prefix` that have each bit (from 0 to 31) set to 0 or 1. However, the initialization of `pre` and `suf` is incorrect. `pre` is initialized with `pre[i][0] += 1` for all `i` from 0 to 31, which is not necessary and does not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The bitwise operations used to update `pre` and `suf` are correct. The function correctly updates the counts of elements with each bit set to 0 or 1 as it iterates through the `prefix` array.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `ans` is incorrect. The formula `ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` does not correctly compute the number of valid tuples \((x, y, z)\) that satisfy the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\). The correct approach should involve checking the condition for each valid tuple \((x, y, z)\) and counting the number of such tuples.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `ans` for each test case, but the calculation of `ans` is flawed, as explained above.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has several issues:
- The function `func_1` should be defined with parameters to handle each test case.
- The initialization of `pre` is incorrect and unnecessary.
- The calculation of `ans` does not correctly implement the required condition for the tuples \((x, y, z)\).

To fix these issues, the function should be redefined to handle each test case properly, and the logic for counting valid tuples should be revised to correctly implement the condition \(f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)\).
