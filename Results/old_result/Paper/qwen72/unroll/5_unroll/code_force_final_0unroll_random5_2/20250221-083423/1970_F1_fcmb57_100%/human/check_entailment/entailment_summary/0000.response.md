Reasoning:  
The provided program has a critical flaw in the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to handle the movement of players on the grid, but it incorrectly assumes that `b` (which represents the movement direction) can be unpacked into two integers (`dx` and `dy`). However, `mouvements` is a dictionary where the values are tuples, and `b` is a tuple, not an integer. The function should correctly unpack `b` as a tuple to apply the movement correctly.

Additionally, the program does not handle the movement of the Quaffle when a player throws it. The Quaffle should move to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, but this is not implemented in the given code.

The program also does not check if a player is carrying the Quaffle before attempting to throw it, which could lead to incorrect behavior.

Finally, the program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal, which should award a point to the opposing team.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
