The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variables `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
