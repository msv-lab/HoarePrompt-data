### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` as an empty list.
   - It iterates over each item in the `array`, adding the length of the string representation of the item to `total_digits`.
   - It also calls `func_1` on each item to count the trailing zeros and appends the result to the `zeros` list if the count is greater than 0.

3. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the values at even indices to `subtract_zero`.
   - This step is intended to account for the fact that Sasha can concatenate two numbers, and the trailing zeros of one number might be removed when concatenated with another number.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets the answer to "Sashah" (which should be "Sasha").
   - If the condition is false, it sets the answer to "Anna".

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints each answer in the `answers` list.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error**: The program sets the answer to "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a typo and should be corrected.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program contains a typographical error that affects the output. The correct answer should be "Sasha" instead of "Sashah".

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'  # Corrected from 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: False** (due to the typographical error in the output).
