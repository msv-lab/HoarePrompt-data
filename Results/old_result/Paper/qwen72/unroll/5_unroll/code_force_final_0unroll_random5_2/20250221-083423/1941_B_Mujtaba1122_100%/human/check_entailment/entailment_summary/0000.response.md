### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, for any index `i` in the range `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - **func_2**: This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero. It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` and applies the operation as long as the conditions `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0` are met. If at any point an element from index 0 to `n-2` is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns. If the loop completes, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1** is straightforward and correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - **func_2** is more complex. It attempts to apply the operation in a way that reduces the elements to zero. However, there are a few issues:
     - The operation is applied in a way that might not be optimal. Specifically, the line `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]` and `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` suggests that the operation is being applied repeatedly with a decrement based on the value of `list[i-1]`. This can lead to incorrect results if the values are not properly balanced.
     - The condition `list[i] > 1` might prevent the function from applying the operation in some cases where it could still be valid (e.g., if `list[i]` is 1 and the adjacent elements are non-zero).
     - The function does not handle edge cases where the array might already be zero or where the operation might not be applicable due to the constraints of the problem.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first example `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the function correctly applies the operations and prints 'YES'.
   - For the second example `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the function might not correctly apply the operations, leading to an incorrect 'NO' output.
   - For the third example `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`, the function correctly applies the operations and prints 'YES'.
   - For the fourth example `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`, the function might not correctly apply the operations, leading to an incorrect 'NO' output.
   - For the fifth example `[1, 2, 7, 2]`, the function might not correctly apply the operations, leading to an incorrect 'NO' output.
   - For the sixth example `[7, 1, 0]`, the function might not correctly apply the operations, leading to an incorrect 'NO' output.
   - For the seventh example `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function might not correctly apply the operations, leading to an incorrect 'NO' output.

Given the issues identified in the function `func_2`, particularly the non-optimal application of the operation and the potential for incorrect results, the program is not correct.

### Correctness: **False**
