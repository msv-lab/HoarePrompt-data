You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))

    #State: `ones` is a list where `ones[i]` represents the count of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to index `i-1`. `sum` is a list where `sum[i]` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from index 0 to index `i-1` and 1.

        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')

        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]

        else:

    #State: The values of `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `q` times, processing input pairs `(l, r)` and printing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop body.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `testCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program initializes two lists `ones` and `sum` of length `n + 1` to store prefix sums.
   - `ones[i]` stores the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of the values `nums[j] - 1` for `j` in the range `0:i`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, it updates `ones[i]` to be the count of 1s up to index `i-1` in `nums`.
   - It updates `sum[i]` to be the sum of `nums[j] - 1` up to index `i-1` in `nums`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no other element to satisfy the condition `a_i \neq b_i` for every index `i`.
   - It calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l:r]` using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the values `c[j] - 1` for `j` in the range `l` to `r` using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

5. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}
     \]
   - Simplifying the condition:
     \[
     2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} = \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1)
     \]
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` is at least the number of elements in the subarray plus the number of 1s in the subarray. This is necessary because for each 1 in the subarray, we need to find a corresponding positive integer in `b` that is not 1, and for each other element, we need to find a positive integer that is different but still positive.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints `YES` if the subarray is good, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It efficiently uses prefix sums to handle the queries in constant time after preprocessing the array in linear time.

Correctness: **True**
