### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - This part of the program is correct and handles the initial conditions as described in the problem statement.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes two boolean variables `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has found the maximum value in `a`.
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns:
     - If both players have found the maximum value, it appends the remaining turns' scores as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both lists and breaks out of the loop.
     - If only Bodya has found the maximum value, it appends `maxa` to `b` for the remaining turns.
     - If only Sasha has found the maximum value, it appends `maxa` to `s` for the remaining turns.
     - If neither has found the maximum value, it appends the current position's value in `a` to the respective list and updates the position based on the permutation `p`.
   - The assumption that a player will always stay at the position with the maximum value in `a` once they reach it is incorrect. The problem statement clearly states that the player can choose to stay or move to `p_x` on each turn. Therefore, the program's logic for handling the maximum value is flawed.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the potential final scores for each player by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value in `a`.
   - This part of the program is also incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the game as described. It should consider the player's choice to stay or move at each turn.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential final scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, and "Draw" if they are equal.
   - The comparison logic is correct, but the scores themselves are incorrect due to the flawed simulation.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `maxa`:**
  - The program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in `a`, they will always stay at that position and collect `maxa` for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true because the player can choose to stay or move to `p_x`.
  - The program should simulate the game more accurately by considering the player's choice to stay or move at each turn.

- **Inefficient Simulation:**
  - The program simulates the game for `k` turns, which can be inefficient for large `k` (up to \(10^9\)).
  - A more efficient approach would be to detect cycles in the permutation and use the cycle length to determine the scores for the remaining turns.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It makes incorrect assumptions about the players' movements and does not handle large values of `k` efficiently.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
