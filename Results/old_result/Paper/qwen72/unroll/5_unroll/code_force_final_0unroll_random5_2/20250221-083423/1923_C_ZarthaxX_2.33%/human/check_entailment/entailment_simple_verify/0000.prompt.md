You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q tuples, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in the condition used to determine if a subarray is good. Specifically, the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is incorrect. This condition is supposed to check if the subarray can be transformed into a good array by changing each element to a different positive integer. However, the logic used in the condition does not correctly handle all cases.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
1 2 1 2 1
1 5
1 3
3 5
```

For the subarray `c[1:5]` (1 2 1 2 1):
- `onesInRange` = 3 (there are three 1s in the subarray)
- `sumInRange` = (1-1) + (2-1) + (1-1) + (2-1) + (1-1) = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2

The program's condition evaluates to:
- `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
- `2 * 3 + (5 - 1 + 1) - 3 <= 2`
- `6 + 5 - 3 <= 2`
- `8 <= 2` (which is false)

However, this subarray is actually good. We can transform it into a good array by changing each element to a different positive integer, for example:
- `b = [2, 1, 2, 1, 2]` (where `sum(b) = 8` and `sum(c[1:5]) = 7`)

The correct condition should be:
- `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange > sumInRange`

This ensures that the sum of the transformed array `b` can be equal to the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` while satisfying all the conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
