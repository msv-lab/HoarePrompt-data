### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Check:**
   - The program correctly parses the input and checks if `k` is greater than `n`. If `k > n`, it prints `n` because no operations can be performed, and this is correct.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the frequency of each number in the list `arr` and cap it at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is a logical step to ensure that the frequency of any number does not exceed `k`, which is the maximum number of cards that can be exchanged in one operation.
   - However, the capping at `k` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if a number appears 4 times and `k` is 3, the function will cap the frequency at 3, which is incorrect because you can perform one exchange operation and reduce the count to 1.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic in the loop checks if any frequency in the `freq` dictionary is exactly `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1`, which is incorrect. The correct approach should be to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible operations.
   - The program fails to account for the possibility of performing multiple operations on the same number. For example, if a number appears 6 times and `k` is 3, you can perform two operations to reduce the count to 0, which is not considered in the current logic.

4. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     5 3
     4 1 1 4 4
     ```
     - The expected output is `2`.
     - The actual output of the program is `5` because it does not correctly handle the frequency of the number 4, which appears 3 times. The program should recognize that you can perform one operation to reduce the count of 4s to 0 and be left with 2 cards (both 1s).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve:
     - Counting the frequency of each number in the list.
     - For each frequency, determine how many operations can be performed to reduce the count.
     - Calculate the remaining cards after all operations.
     - The minimum number of cards left can be determined by summing the remaining cards for all numbers.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the frequency of numbers and the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after operations is flawed. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
