Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the two installations launch fireworks at the same time. According to the problem description, if both installations launch fireworks at the same time, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously should be counted as one more than the sum of the individual counts. However, the program simply adds the individual counts and an additional 2, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The expected output is 4, because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes (from x to x + 1). Therefore, at any given minute, there are 2 fireworks from the first installation and 2 fireworks from the second installation visible, totaling 4 fireworks.

However, the program outputs:
```
5
```
This is incorrect because it adds an extra 2 without considering the overlap correctly. The correct logic should account for the overlap and not just add a fixed number.
