Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key points are:

1. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is necessary because if `n` is less than `m`, it's impossible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Even Difference Check**: The program then checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of `n` moves must be an even number of additions or removals to end up with exactly `m` cubes. If the difference is odd, it's impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if both conditions are met, and "NO" otherwise.

The logic and the implementation are correct based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
