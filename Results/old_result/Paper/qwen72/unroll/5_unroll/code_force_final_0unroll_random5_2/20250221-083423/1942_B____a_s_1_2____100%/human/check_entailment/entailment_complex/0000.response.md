Reasoning:

The program aims to construct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the given relationship \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\). The algorithm works by iterating from the end of the array `a` to the beginning and calculating each element of `p` using the relationship \(p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i\).

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the largest possible value for the MEX of the permutation `p` before any elements are added.
   - `p` is initialized to a list of `-1` values, indicating that no elements have been determined yet.

2. **Backward Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), which means it processes the elements of `a` in reverse order.
   - For each index `i`, the value of `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]`. This is derived from the given relationship \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\), rearranged to \(p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i\).
   - `mex` is then updated to the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` is always the smallest value that has not yet been used in the permutation `p`.

3. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `p`, the function prints the elements of `p` for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of the MEX calculation**:
  - The MEX of a prefix of `p` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in that prefix.
  - By starting with `mex = n` and updating it to the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`, the algorithm ensures that `mex` is always the correct MEX for the current prefix of `p`.

- **Handling of the relationship**:
  - The relationship \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\) is correctly inverted to \(p_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - a_i\).
  - The backward iteration ensures that the MEX calculation is consistent with the elements already determined in `p`.

- **Example Verification**:
  - For the input `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
    - `mex = 5`
    - `p[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = min(5, 3) = 3`
    - `p[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = min(3, 2) = 2`
    - `p[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = min(2, 4) = 2`
    - `p[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = min(2, 1) = 1`
    - `p[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = min(1, 0) = 0`
  - The resulting `p` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the example provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given relationship for the array `a`. The backward iteration and MEX calculation are consistent with the problem constraints and the provided examples.
