Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters ('.', '@', '*') representing the path. The first cell of each path is guaranteed to be empty ('.').**
