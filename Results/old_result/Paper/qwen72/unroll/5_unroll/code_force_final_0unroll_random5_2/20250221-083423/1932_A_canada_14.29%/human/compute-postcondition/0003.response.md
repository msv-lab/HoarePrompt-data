Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of inputs where each input consists of an integer `len` and a string `s` of length `len`. The function counts the number of '@' characters in `s` until it encounters two consecutive '*' characters, at which point it stops counting. The function then prints the count of '@' characters for each input. The function does not return any value and does not modify the global state or the input parameters `t`, `n`, and `path` (if they exist outside the function). **
