Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of finding an array \( a \) of length \( n \) such that exactly \( k \) of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program reads multiple test cases from the input, processes each test case, and prints the result.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input using `for s in [*open(0)][1:]`, which reads all lines from the standard input, excluding the first line (which contains the number of test cases). This is a correct way to read the input.

2. **Parsing Input**: For each test case, the program splits the line into two integers \( n \) and \( k \) using `n, k = map(int, s.split())`. This is also correct.

3. **Condition Handling**:
   - **If \( k \geq 2 \)**:
     - **If \( n == k \)**: The program prints a list of \( n \) integers, all equal to \( k \). This is correct because if \( n = k \), the array \( [k, k, \ldots, k] \) (with \( n \) elements) will have exactly \( n \) sorted cyclic shifts, which is \( k \).
     - **If \( n \neq k \)**: The program prints `-1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases where \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \). For example, if \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be \( [1, 2, 3, 1] \), which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: \( [1, 2, 3, 1] \) and \( [1, 1, 2, 3] \).

   - **If \( k < 2 \)**:
     - The program prints a list of integers from 1 to \( n \). This is correct because if \( k = 1 \), the array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) will have exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift (itself). If \( k = 0 \), the array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) will have no sorted cyclic shifts, which is consistent with the problem statement.

However, the program fails to handle the case where \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \). For such cases, a valid array can be constructed by ensuring that the array has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. One way to achieve this is to create an array where the first \( k \) elements are in increasing order, and the remaining elements are in a way that ensures the array has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

Given this, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible valid cases for \( k \geq 2 \) and \( n \neq k \).

Correctness: **False**
