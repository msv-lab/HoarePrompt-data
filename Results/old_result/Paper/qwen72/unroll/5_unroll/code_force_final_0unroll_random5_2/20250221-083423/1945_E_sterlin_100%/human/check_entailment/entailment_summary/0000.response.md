### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p` for each test case.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program aims to find the index of `x` in the permutation `p` using a modified binary search.
   - Before performing the binary search, the program can perform up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search will correctly find `x`.

3. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with initial values `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `right - left = 1`.
   - In each iteration, the middle index `mid` is calculated, and the element at `p[mid]` is compared with `x` to adjust `left` or `right`.

4. **Post-Search Conditions:**
   - If `p[left] == x`, the program prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` array, the program prints `1` and the swap indices to move `x` to the correct position.
   - If `x` is seen but not at the correct position, the program prints `2` and the necessary swap indices to rearrange the permutation.

5. **Swap Logic:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - The `seen` array keeps track of which elements have been considered during the binary search.
   - If `x` is not in the correct position, the program finds the indices of the elements that need to be swapped to place `x` correctly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position but can be moved with a single swap.
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed 2 swaps, which is always sufficient according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of `x` in the permutation `p` using a modified binary search and up to 2 swaps. The input handling, binary search, and swap logic are all consistent with the problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
