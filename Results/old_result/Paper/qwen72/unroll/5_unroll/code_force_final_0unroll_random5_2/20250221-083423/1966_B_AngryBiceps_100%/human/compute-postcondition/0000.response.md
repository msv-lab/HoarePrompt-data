The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` itself does not need to be adjusted, as it is just a counter that will be incremented with each iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
