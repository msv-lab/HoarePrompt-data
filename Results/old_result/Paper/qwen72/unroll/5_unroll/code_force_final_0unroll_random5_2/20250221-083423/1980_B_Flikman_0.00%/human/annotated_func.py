#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. Each tuple represents a test case where `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a_i <= 100`.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on the input. The variables `favorite_value`, `same_value_count`, and `greater_count` are calculated for each test case and used to determine the output ('YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'). After all iterations, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `f`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of integers. It determines if there are at least `k` elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `f-1` (the favorite value). If there are, it prints 'YES'. If there are fewer than `k` elements greater than the favorite value and the sum of these elements and those equal to the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t` and `test_cases` (if they exist) are not modified.
