The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 20, `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
