Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where the array can be sorted by performing the operation multiple times, but the program only performs the operation once and checks if the array is sorted. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
Yes
No
Yes
```

For the first test case, the array can be transformed to a sorted array by performing the operation multiple times:
1. [12, 3, 45, 67] -> [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]
2. [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]

However, the program only performs the operation once and does not check if further operations can lead to a sorted array. Therefore, it incorrectly prints "Yes" for the first test case, even though it should print "YES" to indicate that the array can be sorted with multiple operations.
