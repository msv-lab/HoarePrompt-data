### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It then reads the edges and their weights using `func_3()` and stores them in a list `edges` and a graph `graph`.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex points to its neighbors.
   - The edges are stored in a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` where `w` is the weight and `u` and `v` are the vertices.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - The DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing.
   - The `parent` array is initialized to point to itself, and the `size` array is initialized to 1 for each vertex.
   - The `min_edge` array is initialized to infinity for each vertex.

4. **Edge Sorting and Union-Find:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights.
   - The program then iterates through the sorted edges, performing union operations on the vertices connected by each edge.
   - If the vertices are already in the same set, it updates the minimum edge weight for that set and keeps track of the vertices involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight.

5. **Cycle Detection using DFS:**
   - The program uses a DFS (Depth-First Search) to find a cycle starting from the vertex `node_u` that was involved in the union operation with the minimum edge weight.
   - The `colors` array is used to keep track of the state of each vertex during the DFS:
     - `0` means the vertex has not been visited.
     - `1` means the vertex is currently being visited.
     - `2` means the vertex has been fully visited.
   - The DFS function returns the path if it detects a cycle that includes `node_v`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the cycle `len(res)`.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in the order they were visited.

### Issues and Concerns:
- **Edge Sorting and Union-Find Logic:**
  - The edges are sorted in descending order, which is correct for finding the minimum edge weight in a cycle.
  - However, the union operation is performed even if the vertices are already in the same set, which is unnecessary and could lead to incorrect updates of the `min_edge` array.

- **Cycle Detection:**
  - The DFS function is designed to detect cycles, but it only returns the path if it finds a cycle that includes `node_v`.
  - The condition `if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:` is correct for avoiding revisiting fully visited nodes and the parent node.
  - The `set_res` and `node_v in set_res` check is redundant and can be simplified.

- **DFS State Management:**
  - The `colors` array is not reset between different test cases, which could lead to incorrect cycle detection in subsequent test cases.

### Conclusion:
The program has some logical issues and potential bugs, particularly in the union-find logic and the state management of the DFS. The union operation should only be performed if the vertices are not already in the same set, and the `colors` array should be reset for each test case.
