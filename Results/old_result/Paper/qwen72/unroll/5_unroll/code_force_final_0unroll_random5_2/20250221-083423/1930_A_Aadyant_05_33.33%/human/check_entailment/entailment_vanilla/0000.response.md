### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `num`, from the input.
   - It initializes an empty list `out` to store the results of each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` which represents the number of pairs (i.e., `n`).
   - It then reads a line of input containing `2n` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is crucial because the optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pair the smallest available numbers.
   - It initializes an empty list `list2` to store the minimum values of each pair.

3. **Pairing and Summing:**
   - The program iterates `a` times (i.e., `n` times) and for each iteration, it appends the `2i`-th element of the sorted list `list1` to `list2`. This is because the `2i`-th element (0-based index) will always be the smaller of the two elements in the pair after sorting.
   - After collecting all the minimum values, it calculates the sum of `list2` and appends this sum to the `out` list.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the `out` list.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The strategy of sorting the list and then taking the smaller element of each pair is indeed optimal. This ensures that the smallest numbers are used in the score calculation, which maximizes the score.
- **Input and Output:**
  - The program correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement.
  - It correctly outputs the results for each test case.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 (i.e., only one pair of numbers).
  - It also handles the case where all numbers are the same, as seen in the third test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
