The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) of length `n`. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3).

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It processes up to `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input `n` and `a`.**
