The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return any value; instead, it raises a `TypeError` because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99, inclusive. It raises a `TypeError` because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`, and no value is returned.**
