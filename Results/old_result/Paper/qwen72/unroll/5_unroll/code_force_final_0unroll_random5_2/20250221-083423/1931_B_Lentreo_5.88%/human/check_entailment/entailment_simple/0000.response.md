Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from any container to any container with a higher index. The key insight here is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, and if the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the same amount of water, then the operation described in the problem can achieve this.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. The program initializes `last` with the last element of the `nums` list and then iterates through the list, subtracting `last` from each element and adding the result to `curr`. If `curr` is zero after the loop, the program prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

This approach is flawed because:
1. The variable `last` is set to the last element of the `nums` list, which is not necessarily the target amount of water each container should have after redistribution.
2. The program does not correctly check if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the same amount of water. Instead, it calculates a sum of differences that does not provide the necessary information to determine the possibility of equal distribution.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the target amount of water each container should have, which is the sum of all water divided by the number of containers.
2. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container ends up with the target amount. This can be done by ensuring that the total amount of water that needs to be added to containers to reach the target is equal to the total amount of water that needs to be removed from containers to reach the target.

Given the flawed logic in the provided program, it does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
