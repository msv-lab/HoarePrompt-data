The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and a list of city positions `a`, then calculates two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` that store the cumulative minimum distances for each index in `a` when traversing from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. It then reads the number of queries `m` and a list of queries, each specifying two cities. For each query, it computes and prints the minimum distance between the two specified cities using the precomputed distances in `d1` and `d2`. The function does not return any values but prints the results of the queries. The input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged after the function execution.
