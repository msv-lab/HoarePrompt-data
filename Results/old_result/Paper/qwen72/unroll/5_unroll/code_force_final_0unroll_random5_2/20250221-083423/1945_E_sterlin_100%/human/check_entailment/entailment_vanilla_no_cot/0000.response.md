Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem as described. It only contains functions to read input in various forms, but it does not contain any logic to perform the required operations to rearrange the permutation or to execute the binary search algorithm. The problem requires a solution that can determine the correct swaps (if any) to ensure that the binary search will find the element `x` at position `l` after the algorithm is executed. The given program does not address this requirement.
