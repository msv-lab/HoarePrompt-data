### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The function uses \(10^9 + 7\) as the modulo value, which is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \). This is done using the `pow` function with the third argument as the modulo value, which is a correct way to compute the modular inverse.

4. **Initial Friendship Value Sum**: The variable `a` is used to store the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends. This is correctly computed by iterating over the `m` pairs and adding their friendship values.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The function then iterates over the `k` excursions and calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values plus the number of excursions times the probability of choosing a friend pair. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies `c` by `i` and `m` in a way that does not reflect the correct expected value.

6. **Correct Expected Value Calculation**: The correct expected value for each excursion should be:
   \[
   \text{expected\_value} = \frac{a + i \cdot m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
   \]
   where `a` is the sum of initial friendship values, `i` is the current excursion number, and `m` is the number of friend pairs. The sum of these expected values over all `k` excursions should be:
   \[
   \text{total\_expected\_value} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{a + i \cdot m}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \right)
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   \text{total\_expected\_value} = k \cdot \frac{a}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} + \frac{m \cdot (k-1) \cdot k}{2 \cdot \frac{n(n-1)}{2}}
   \]
   which further simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{total\_expected\_value} = k \cdot \frac{a}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} + \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{n(n-1)}
   \]

7. **Modular Arithmetic**: The function should use modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the expected value calculation, the program is **incorrect**.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        
        # Calculate the total expected value
        expected_value_sum = (k * a * c + m * k * (k - 1) * c // 2) % M
        
        print(expected_value_sum)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Pairs**: `total_pairs` is calculated as \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
- **Modular Inverse**: `c` is the modular inverse of `total_pairs` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: `a` is the sum of all initial friendship values, taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Expected Value Calculation**: The total expected value is calculated using the simplified formula and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
