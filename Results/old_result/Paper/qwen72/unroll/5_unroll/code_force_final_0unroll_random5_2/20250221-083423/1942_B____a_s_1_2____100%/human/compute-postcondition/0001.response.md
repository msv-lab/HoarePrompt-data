The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, and for it to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
