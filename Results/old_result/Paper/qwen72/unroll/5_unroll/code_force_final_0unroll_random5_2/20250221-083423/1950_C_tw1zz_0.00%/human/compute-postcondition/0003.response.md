Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The function converts each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the converted time. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all `t` test cases, the function terminates. **
