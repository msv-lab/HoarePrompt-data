You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers such that 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all i.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: beauty is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which is the value of the variable 'beauty'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and returns the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The input list `array` is modified to be sorted in ascending order, and the returned value is the 'beauty' of the array, which is the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last integer value read from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `array` is the last list of integers created from `data` during the last iteration of the loop, `data` remains the same list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is the position in `data` after all the elements have been processed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(array)` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to handle multiple test cases, and prints the results of applying `func_1` to each test case. Specifically, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the calculation of the maximum beauty of the array. According to the problem description, the beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). However, in the `func_1` function, the beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach is incorrect because the problem does not specify the use of absolute differences. Instead, the correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which would maximize the positive differences.

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `3\n3\n1 2 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

However, for a different input:
- Input: `3\n3\n3 2 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

The program gives the correct output for these specific inputs, but it does not follow the problem description for the general case. The correct approach should be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
