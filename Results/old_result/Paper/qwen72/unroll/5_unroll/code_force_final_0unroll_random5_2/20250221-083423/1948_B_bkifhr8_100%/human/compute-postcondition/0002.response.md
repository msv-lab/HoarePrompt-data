Output State: **The function processes all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether the array `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged, and the internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each test case.**
