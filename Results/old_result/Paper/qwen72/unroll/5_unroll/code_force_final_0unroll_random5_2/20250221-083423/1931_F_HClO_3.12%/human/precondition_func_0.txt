t is a positive integer such that 1 \le t \le 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers where 1 \le k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 and n \cdot k \le 2 \cdot 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 \le a_{ij} \le n) representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, and all a_{ij} are distinct for each line. The sum of n \cdot k across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.
