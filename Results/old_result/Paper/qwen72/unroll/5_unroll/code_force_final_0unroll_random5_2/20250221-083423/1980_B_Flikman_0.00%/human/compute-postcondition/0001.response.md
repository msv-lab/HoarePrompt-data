The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t` is crucial because it determines the number of iterations.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `func` is defined as `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `f`, `k`, and a list `a` of integers. Each tuple represents a test case where `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= f, k <= n <= 100`, and `1 <= a_i <= 100`.**
