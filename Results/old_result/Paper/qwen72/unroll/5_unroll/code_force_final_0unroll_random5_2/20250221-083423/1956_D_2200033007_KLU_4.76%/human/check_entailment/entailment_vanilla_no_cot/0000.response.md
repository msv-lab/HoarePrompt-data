Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The program only handles two specific cases: when the length of the array `a` is 2, and when it is not 2. For the case where the length is 2, it prints a fixed output of `4 1` and `1 2`, which is only correct for the specific input `[0, 1]`. For all other cases, it prints a fixed output of `13 0`, which is only correct for the specific input `[1, 3, 9]`.

The program does not actually compute the MEX of any subarray, nor does it perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. It also does not handle the general case for any input array of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Compute the MEX of the entire array or subarrays.
2. Apply the operation to set the subarray elements to the MEX value.
3. Repeat the operation until no more beneficial operations can be made.
4. Output the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

The provided program fails to meet these requirements and is therefore incorrect.
