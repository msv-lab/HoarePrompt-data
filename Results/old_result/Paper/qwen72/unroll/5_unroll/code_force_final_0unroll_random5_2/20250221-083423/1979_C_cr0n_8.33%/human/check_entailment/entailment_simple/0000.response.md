### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases` and iterates over each test case using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers in `vals` and stores it in `prod`.
   - It then calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
   - The denominator `den` is calculated as `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the function prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins is possible.
   - If `den` is greater than 0, the function prints the list `vprod` as the distribution of coins.

4. **Mathematical Validity:**
   - The key idea is to ensure that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program uses the product of all multipliers `prod` and divides it by each multiplier to get the bets. This ensures that the total sum of bets is less than `prod` (since `prod` is the product of all multipliers, and each bet is a fraction of `prod`).
   - The condition `den > 0` ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than `prod`, which is necessary for the game to be profitable in any outcome.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by checking if `den` is less than or equal to 0.
   - The constraints are respected, and the program ensures that the bets are integers within the valid range.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and handles all the given constraints and edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
