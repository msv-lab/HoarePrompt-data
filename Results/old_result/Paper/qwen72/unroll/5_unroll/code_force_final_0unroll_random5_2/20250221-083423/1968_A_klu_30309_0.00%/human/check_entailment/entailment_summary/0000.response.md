Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The function `func_1` attempts to find the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \) and greater than 1. If such a divisor exists, it is returned. If no such divisor exists, 1 is returned.

Let's analyze the logic:

1. **Finding the Largest Divisor**:
   - The function iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 to find the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
   - The function checks if \( 2 * y \ge x \). If this condition is true, it returns \( y \) immediately. This condition ensures that \( y \) is at least half of \( x \), which is a reasonable heuristic for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

2. **If No Divisor is Found**:
   - If no divisor is found that satisfies \( x \% y == 0 \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns 1. This is because 1 is always a divisor of any integer \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is a valid (though not necessarily optimal) result.

3. **Optimality**:
   - The function's approach of returning the largest divisor \( y \) that is at least half of \( x \) is a good heuristic because it ensures that \( y \) is as large as possible, and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), which maximizes the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If \( x \) is a prime number, the only divisors are 1 and \( x \). In this case, the function will return 1, which is correct because \( \gcd(x, 1) + 1 = 2 \) is the maximum possible value for \( y \) in this scenario.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For \( x = 6 \), the function should return 3, and \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6 \), which is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` appears to correctly solve the problem for the given constraints and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
