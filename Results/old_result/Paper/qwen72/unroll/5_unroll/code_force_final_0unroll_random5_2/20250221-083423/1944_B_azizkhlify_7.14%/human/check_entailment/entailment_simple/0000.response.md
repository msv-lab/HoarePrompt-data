### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is not named appropriately for the problem. A more suitable name would be `find_subarrays`.
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case in a loop, which is correct.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to `[0] * n`, which is incorrect. These arrays should be used to count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the input array `a`, respectively. However, the correct approach would be to use two lists to store the selected elements for `l` and `r`.

3. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program attempts to count the occurrences of each number in the first and second halves of the array `a` using the `l` and `r` arrays. However, the indices used in the loops are incorrect. The correct approach would be to use a dictionary or a list to keep track of the counts.

4. **Selecting Elements for `l`**:
   - The program correctly identifies elements that appear twice in the first half of the array and prints them. However, it does not handle the case where the number of elements needed to reach `2k` is not met by elements appearing twice.

5. **Selecting Elements for `r`**:
   - The program attempts to select elements for `r` but does not handle the case where the number of elements needed to reach `2k` is not met by elements appearing twice in the second half of the array.
   - The program also does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements for `l` and `r` but does not ensure that the conditions of the problem are met. Specifically, it does not guarantee that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`. Additionally, the way it handles the selection of elements and the counting of occurrences is flawed. A correct implementation would need to ensure that the selected elements meet the problem's requirements.
