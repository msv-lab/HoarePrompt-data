You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. It then prints 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. After processing all test cases, the values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read during the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After making the choice, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., whose wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially about the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both players play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both players play optimally.

3. **Explanation of the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b` from the input.
   - It then checks the parity of the sum `(a + b)`.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Verification of the Logic**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of `(a + b)` is correct because:
     - If `(a + b)` is even, the game will end with both wallets being empty on Bob's turn, making Bob the winner.
     - If `(a + b)` is odd, the game will end with both wallets being empty on Alice's turn, making Alice the winner.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly splits the input string to extract `a` and `b`.
   - It converts the extracted strings to integers, which is necessary for the arithmetic operations.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are both 1 (as shown in the first test case).
   - It also handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and follows the optimal strategy for determining the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

Correctness: **True**
