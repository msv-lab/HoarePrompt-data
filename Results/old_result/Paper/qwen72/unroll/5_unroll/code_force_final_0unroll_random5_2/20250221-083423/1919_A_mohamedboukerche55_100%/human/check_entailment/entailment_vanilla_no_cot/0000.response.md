Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program to determine the winner is based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets being even or odd. However, this is not a correct approach to determine the winner of the game described.

The correct approach should consider the following:

1. **Initial Condition**: If either Alice or Bob starts with 1 coin, the player with more than 1 coin can always force a win by swapping and then reducing the coin count.
2. **Optimal Play**: If both players have more than 1 coin, the game can be analyzed by considering the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of coins each player has. The player who starts with an odd number of coins can always force the other player to end up with 1 coin first, and thus win the game.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a, b = map(int, s.split())
        if a == 1 and b > 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1 and a > 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program checks the initial conditions and the parity of the coin counts to determine the winner correctly.
