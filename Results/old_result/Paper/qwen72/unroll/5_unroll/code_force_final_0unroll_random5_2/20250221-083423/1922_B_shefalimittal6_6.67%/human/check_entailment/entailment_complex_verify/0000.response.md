### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a fundamental flaw in the provided program. The program indeed does not correctly handle the formation of non-degenerate triangles. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues and the reasoning:

1. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**:
   - A non-degenerate triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem.
   - The program only counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length or 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length, without checking if these combinations satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     3 2 1 3
     ```
     - The program will output `2` because it counts the combinations (3, 3, 2) and (3, 3, 1).
     - However, the lengths of the sticks are \(2^3 = 8\), \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^1 = 2\), and \(2^3 = 8\). The only possible combinations are (8, 8, 4) and (8, 8, 2), but neither of these combinations satisfies the triangle inequality theorem:
       - \(8 + 8 \leq 4\) is false.
       - \(8 + 8 \leq 2\) is false.
       - \(8 + 4 \leq 8\) is true, but \(8 + 2 \leq 8\) is true, and \(4 + 2 \leq 8\) is true.
     - Therefore, the correct output should be `0`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
     - Count the occurrences of each stick length.
     - For each unique length, check if there are enough sticks to form a triangle.
     - For each combination of three different lengths, check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle the formation of non-degenerate triangles as it fails to account for the triangle inequality theorem.

Final: **False**
