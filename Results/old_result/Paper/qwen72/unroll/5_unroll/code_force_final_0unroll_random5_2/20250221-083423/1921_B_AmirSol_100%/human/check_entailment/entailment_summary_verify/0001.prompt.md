You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    print(func_1(n, s1, s2))

def func_1(n: int, s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    cats_to_add = sum((1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '0' and s2[i] == '1'))
    cats_to_remove = sum((1 for i in range(n) if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0'))
    return max(cats_to_add, cats_to_remove)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: a positive integer `n` and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1' characters. It returns the maximum number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, either with `s1[i]` being '0' and `s2[i]` being '1', or with `s1[i]` being '1' and `s2[i]` being '0'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an initial state `s1` and a desired state `s2` of `n` boxes, where each box can either contain a cat ('1') or not ('0').
   - The goal is to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2` using the minimum number of operations. The operations allowed are:
     - Adding a cat to an empty box.
     - Removing a cat from a box.
     - Moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Analyzing the Operations:**
   - Adding a cat to an empty box (from '0' to '1') is necessary when `s1[i] == '0'` and `s2[i] == '1'`.
   - Removing a cat from a box (from '1' to '0') is necessary when `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'`.
   - Moving a cat from one box to another (from '1' in one box to '0' in another box) can be done in one operation, but it does not change the overall count of cats that need to be added or removed.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Days:**
   - The key insight is that the number of days required is determined by the maximum of the number of cats that need to be added and the number of cats that need to be removed.
   - This is because you can add and remove cats independently, and the limiting factor is the larger of the two counts. For example, if you need to add 3 cats and remove 2 cats, you can do this in 3 days by adding one cat per day and removing one cat per day for the first 2 days, and adding the last cat on the third day.

4. **Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats to add and the number of cats to remove.
   - It then returns the maximum of these two values, which is the minimum number of days required to achieve the desired state.

5. **Input and Output:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `s1`, and `s2`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to compute the result for each test case and prints it.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the initial and desired states are the same (e.g., `s1 = "1"` and `s2 = "1"`), which requires 0 days.
   - It also handles cases where the number of cats to add and remove are different, correctly returning the maximum of the two.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of days required to transform the initial state to the desired state. It accounts for all the necessary operations and edge cases.
