t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, each containing three elements: (n, k, a, x) where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
