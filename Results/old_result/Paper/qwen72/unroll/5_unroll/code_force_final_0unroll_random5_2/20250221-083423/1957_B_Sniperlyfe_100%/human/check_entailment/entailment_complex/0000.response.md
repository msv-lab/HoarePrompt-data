Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the output for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It subtracts this value from `k` to account for the sum used by the first element.
   - It then iterates through the remaining elements of `nums` and assigns each element the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` (which is the next largest number with one more bit set to 1) and the remaining value of `k`.
   - If `k` is still greater than 0 after the loop, it adds the remaining `k` to the first element `nums[0]`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the results, each on a new line.

4. **Analysis of the Function:**
   - The function ensures that the sum of the elements in `nums` equals `k` by adjusting the first element if necessary.
   - The choice of `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` for the first element maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The subsequent elements are assigned the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` to ensure that the sum constraint is met and the number of 1s is maximized.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly returns the single integer `k`.
   - For `n > 1`, the function distributes the sum `k` among the elements while ensuring the bitwise OR has the maximum number of 1s.

6. **Final State:**
   - The final state of `nums` is a list of length `n` where the sum of the elements equals `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
