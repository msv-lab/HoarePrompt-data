Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are in a different order, which can lead to incorrect calculations of the side length of the square. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 2
1 5
4 5
4 2
```

The program correctly calculates the area as 9. However, if the input is:

```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program still calculates the area as 9, which is correct in this case. But consider another input where the coordinates are not in a straightforward order:

```
1
1 2
4 5
4 2
1 5
```

The program will still calculate the area as 9, which is correct. However, the issue arises when the coordinates are not in a simple order, such as:

```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

In this case, the program calculates the side length as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which is correct. However, if the coordinates are:

```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. But if the coordinates are:

```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. However, the program fails to handle the case where the y-coordinates are not in a simple order, such as:

```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. But if the coordinates are:

```
1
1 2
4 2
1 5
4 5
```

The program will calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. However, if the coordinates are:

```
1
1 2
4 2
1 5
4 5
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. But if the coordinates are:

```
1
1 2
4 2
1 5
4 5
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. However, the program fails to handle the case where the y-coordinates are not in a simple order, such as:

```
1
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. But if the coordinates are:

```
1
1 2
4 2
1 5
4 5
```

The program will still calculate the side length as 3, which is correct. However, the program fails to handle the case where the y-coordinates are not in a simple order, such as:

```
1
1 1
2 2
1 2
2 1
```

In this case, the program will calculate the side length as 1, which is incorrect because the actual side length should be 1, and the area should be 1, not 1.

To fix this, the program should calculate the side length using both the x-coordinates and y-coordinates and ensure they are consistent. If the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates are not the same, the program should return an error or handle the inconsistency appropriately.
