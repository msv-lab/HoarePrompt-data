The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers, and `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`. The list `a` contains integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n`, and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list `a`.

The function returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice.**
