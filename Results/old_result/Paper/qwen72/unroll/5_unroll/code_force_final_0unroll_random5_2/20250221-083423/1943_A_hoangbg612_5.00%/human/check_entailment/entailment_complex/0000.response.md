Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.
   - The array `N` is then sorted to facilitate the MEX calculation.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `M` to keep track of the counts of elements in `N`.
   - The function iterates through the sorted list `N`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop, indicating that the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is a step to ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated.
   - The function then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of each integer `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If this condition is met, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks the loop.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `cur` for each test case, which should be the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed the limit.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the array `N` is empty or contains only one element.

6. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The function's logic aligns with the optimal strategy for both players. Alice will try to maximize the MEX by choosing the smallest available integer, and Bob will try to minimize it by choosing the smallest available integer that is not chosen by Alice.

However, there is a potential issue in the logic:
- The line `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:` is incorrect. The sum of the counts in `M` should not be compared to `S` (the size of the array). Instead, it should be checked if all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array `N` with the correct counts.

To fix this, the logic should be:
- After the loop, check if all integers from 0 to `cur` are present in the array `N` with the correct counts. If so, increment `cur` by 1.

Given the current logic, the function might not always produce the correct MEX for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        N.sort()
        
        cur = 0
        
        while cur < len(N) and N[cur] == cur:
            cur += 1
        
        print(cur)
```

This corrected version directly finds the MEX by iterating through the sorted list and checking if the current index matches the value at that index. If it does, it increments `cur` until it finds the first mismatch, which is the MEX. This approach is more straightforward and aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
