The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of monsters and the number of bullets you can fire per second, respectively. Additionally, each test case includes two lists of integers: `a` of length n, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster, and `x` of length n, where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
