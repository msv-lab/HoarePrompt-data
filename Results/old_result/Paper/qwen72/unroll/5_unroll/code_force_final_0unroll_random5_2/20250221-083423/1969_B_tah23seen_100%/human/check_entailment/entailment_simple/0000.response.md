Reasoning:  
The program aims to calculate the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that the cost to sort the string can be minimized by focusing on the transitions from '1' to '0'. Each time a '0' follows a '1', a cyclic shift is needed to move the '0' to the left of the '1' to sort the string. The cost of such a shift is the length of the substring that includes the '1' and the '0' that follows it.

However, the current implementation in `func_1` has a flaw. It calculates the cost as `one + 1` every time it encounters a '0' after a '1', where `one` is the count of '1's seen so far. This approach does not correctly account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string. Specifically, it overestimates the cost because it does not consider the possibility of performing a single cyclic shift on a larger substring that contains multiple '1's and '0's.

To correctly calculate the minimum total cost, the program should:
1. Identify the longest contiguous segment of '1's.
2. Calculate the cost based on the number of '0's that need to be moved past this segment to sort the string.

The current implementation does not correctly handle this, and it will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the string `101011`:
- The current implementation will calculate the cost as follows:
  - First '0' after '1': cost += 2 (1 + 1)
  - Second '0' after '1': cost += 3 (2 + 1)
  - Total cost: 5

However, the optimal way to sort this string is:
- Perform a cyclic shift on the entire string: `101011` → `111010` → `111100`
- The total cost for this optimal solution is 6, not 5.

Therefore, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
