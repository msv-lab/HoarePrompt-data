Output State: **obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and d is a string representing the direction ('R'). The coordinates in obj are now (obj[0], obj[1] + 1), and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. The direction d is not 'U', the direction d is not 'D', the direction d is not 'L', and the current value of d is 'R'.**
