You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices, and you can choose no more than \( y \) additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, \( y = 0 \), meaning you cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, the first line contains \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - The second line contains the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to count the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive vertices.
   - Additionally, it checks the gap between the last and the first vertex, considering the polygon's cyclic nature.
   - Finally, it adds \( x - 2 \) to the count of gaps of size 1 to get the total number of triangles.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Gaps of Size 1:**
     - If there is a gap of size 1 between two consecutive vertices, it means there is an edge between them, and this edge can be part of a triangle.
     - The program correctly counts these gaps.
   - **Cyclic Gap:**
     - The program also correctly checks the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list.
   - **Total Triangles:**
     - The formula \( x - 2 \) is used to account for the fact that \( x \) vertices can form \( x - 2 \) triangles if they are all connected in a non-intersecting manner.
     - This is a known result in combinatorial geometry for a convex polygon with \( x \) vertices.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where \( y = 0 \) correctly, as it does not attempt to choose any additional vertices.
   - The program also handles the case where \( x = 2 \) correctly, as it will output 0 (since 2 vertices cannot form any triangles).

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \), and vertices \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \):
     - Sorted vertices: \( 1, 2, 5, 6 \)
     - Gaps of size 1: \( 1 \) (between 1 and 2), \( 1 \) (between 5 and 6)
     - Cyclic gap: \( 1 \) (between 6 and 1)
     - Total triangles: \( 2 + 4 - 2 = 4 \) (but the correct answer is 2, so the cyclic gap check should not add an extra triangle)
   - For the input \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), \( y = 0 \), and vertices \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \):
     - Sorted vertices: \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \)
     - Gaps of size 1: \( 7 \) (since all vertices are consecutive)
     - Cyclic gap: \( 0 \) (since the last and first vertices are consecutive)
     - Total triangles: \( 7 + 8 - 2 = 13 \) (but the correct answer is 6, so the cyclic gap check should not add an extra triangle)
   - For the input \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), \( y = 0 \), and vertices \( 1, 3 \):
     - Sorted vertices: \( 1, 3 \)
     - Gaps of size 1: \( 0 \) (since the gap between 1 and 3 is 2)
     - Cyclic gap: \( 0 \) (since the gap between 3 and 1 is 2)
     - Total triangles: \( 0 + 2 - 2 = 0 \) (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly counts the gaps of size 1 and adds \( x - 2 \) to get the total number of triangles. However, the cyclic gap check should not add an extra triangle if the gap is already considered in the linear gaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect in handling the cyclic gap check.

### Correctness:
**False**
