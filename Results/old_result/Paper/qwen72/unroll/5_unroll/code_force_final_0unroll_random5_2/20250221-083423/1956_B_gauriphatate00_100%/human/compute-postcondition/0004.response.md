The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `num` will start at 1 and increment by 1 up to `n`. The state of `count_a`, `a`, and `max_score` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`num` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged, `max_score` is 0.**
