Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program's logic in the `func_1` function is indeed flawed. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the number of cubes, but it does not consider the parity (evenness or oddness) of the difference between `n` and `m`. This is crucial because Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time, and the only way to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves is if the difference `n - m` is even. This is because each move can either increase or decrease the height of the tower by 1, and to reach a specific height `m` from 0, the total number of moves (additions and removals) must balance out in such a way that the difference between the total moves and the final height is even.

For example:
- In the test case `2 1`, the program will output "No" because `n` (2) is not greater than or equal to `m` (1). However, the correct output should be "Yes" because Nikita can achieve a tower with 1 cube after 2 moves by adding a cube, removing it, and then adding it again.
- In the test case `3 2`, the program will output "Yes" because `n` (3) is greater than or equal to `m` (2). However, the correct output should be "No" because it is impossible to end up with exactly 2 cubes after 3 moves, as the difference `n - m` (3 - 2 = 1) is odd.

Thus, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Final: **False**
