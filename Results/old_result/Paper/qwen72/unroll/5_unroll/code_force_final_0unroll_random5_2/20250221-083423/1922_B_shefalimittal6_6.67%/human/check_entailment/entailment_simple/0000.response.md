Reasoning:  

The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks from a given set of sticks such that a non-degenerate triangle can be formed. A non-degenerate triangle is one where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks (as powers of 2) in the list `nums`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length (i.e., each value in `nums`).

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It iterates over the counts of each stick length in `num_of_lens`.
     - If a stick length appears at least 3 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of that length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)` and adds this to `res`.
     - If a stick length appears at least 2 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of that length and one stick of any other length. This is done by summing the counts of all other stick lengths (`total_sum`) and then multiplying by the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the current length (`math.comb(cnt, 2)`).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result `res` for each test case.

### Correctness Check:

- **Case 1: All sticks have the same length.**
  - If all sticks have the same length, any three sticks can form a triangle. The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `n` sticks using `math.comb(n, 3)`.
  - Example: For `n = 7` and all `a_i = 1`, the program outputs `35`, which is correct.

- **Case 2: Sticks have different lengths.**
  - The program correctly handles the case where sticks have different lengths and calculates the number of valid triangles.
  - Example: For `n = 4` and `a_i = [3, 2, 1, 3]`, the program outputs `2`, which is correct. The valid combinations are (1, 2, 3) and (1, 3, 3).

- **Case 3: No valid triangles can be formed.**
  - If no valid triangles can be formed, the program correctly outputs `0`.
  - Example: For `n = 3` and `a_i = [1, 2, 3]`, the program outputs `0`, which is correct. The lengths 2, 4, and 8 cannot form a triangle.

- **Case 4: Single stick.**
  - If there is only one stick, no triangle can be formed, and the program correctly outputs `0`.
  - Example: For `n = 1` and `a_i = [1]`, the program outputs `0`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately. It correctly counts the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
