You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

                total_sum = sum((i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt))
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) for a test case, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has printed the value of `res` for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, `cnt`, `total_sum`, and `x` are reset for each iteration of the loop, and their final values after the loop completes are undefined (as they are local to each iteration).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the number of valid triplets of indices (i, j, k) such that the elements at these indices are the same or two of them are the same and the third is different. The function prints the result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has printed the value of `res` for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `num_of_lens`, `nums`, `res`, `cnt`, `total_sum`, and `x` are reset for each iteration of the loop, and their final values after the loop completes are undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the formation of non-degenerate triangles. The program counts the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length. However, it does not check if the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle, which requires the sum of the lengths of any two sides to be greater than the length of the third side.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
3 2 1 3
```
The program will output `2`, but this is incorrect. The only valid triangles that can be formed are with sticks of lengths \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\) (i.e., 2, 4, 8), which cannot form a non-degenerate triangle because \(2 + 4 \leq 8\). Therefore, the correct output should be `0`.

The program fails to account for the triangle inequality theorem, which is essential for determining if a set of sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
