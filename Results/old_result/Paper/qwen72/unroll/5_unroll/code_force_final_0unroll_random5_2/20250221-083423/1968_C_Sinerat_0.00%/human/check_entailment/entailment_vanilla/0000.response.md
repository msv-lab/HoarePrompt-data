Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because `1 <= a[0] <= 10^9` and the problem does not specify any particular value for `a[0]`.

2. **Construction of `a[i]`**:
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]` for all `1 <= i < n`.
   - This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = x[i-1]` because `a[i]` is exactly `a[i-1]` plus `x[i-1]`, which means the remainder when `a[i]` is divided by `a[i-1]` is `x[i-1]`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The problem states that `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`.
   - Since `a[0]` is 500, and each subsequent `a[i]` is constructed by adding a value between 1 and 500 to the previous `a[i-1]`, the values of `a[i]` will always be within the range `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` for each test case, which satisfies the conditions given in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 2` correctly. For example, if `x = [500]`, the program will output `500 1000`, which satisfies `a[2] % a[1] = 1000 % 500 = 500`.

6. **Multiple Solutions**:
   - The problem allows for multiple valid solutions, and the program provides one valid solution by always starting with `a[0] = 500` and constructing subsequent values as `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
