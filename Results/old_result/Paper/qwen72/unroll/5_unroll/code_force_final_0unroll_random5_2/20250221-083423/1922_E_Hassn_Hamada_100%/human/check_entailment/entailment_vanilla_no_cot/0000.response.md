Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1` Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `n - 1` as the argument, but the problem description does not specify that the number of increasing subsequences should be `n - 1`. The function should be called with `n` directly.

2. **Incorrect Sequence Generation Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` is not correctly generating the sequence that would have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The bitwise operations and the way the sequence is being built are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Output for Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `X` is 2, the program should output a sequence that has exactly 2 increasing subsequences, but the current logic does not guarantee this.

4. **Sequence Length Constraint**: The program does not ensure that the length of the generated sequence is at most 200. The problem description specifies that the length of the array should be at most 200, and the current logic does not enforce this constraint.

5. **Sequence Element Range**: The program does not ensure that the elements of the sequence are within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`. While the current logic might not produce elements outside this range, it is not explicitly checked.

To correct the program, you would need to implement a more robust algorithm that ensures the sequence meets the problem's requirements, including the correct number of increasing subsequences, the length constraint, and the element range constraint.
