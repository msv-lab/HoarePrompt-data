The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>'. The function evaluates each test case to determine if it is possible to reach the second row from the first row by following the arrows, and returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating the result for each test case. The final state of the program includes the original `t` and `test_cases` unchanged, and a new list `results` containing the evaluation results.
