You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    #State: `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, `max_val` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, or 1 if no such divisor exists.
    return max_val
    #The program returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1, or 1 if no such divisor exists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (where 2 <= x <= 1000) and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than `x` and greater than 1. If no such divisor exists, it returns 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number correctly. For a prime number `x`, the only `y` that satisfies `1 <= y < x` and maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` is `y = 1`, because the only divisor of a prime number `x` (other than `x` itself) is `1`. However, the function `func_1` skips `y = 1` in the loop (`range(x - 1, 1, -1)`), and thus it will not return `1` for prime numbers. For example, for `x = 7`, the correct output should be `1`, but the program will return `6`, which is incorrect.
