Reasoning:  
The program provided appears to follow the decoding algorithm correctly as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the steps and their correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - **Character Mapping**: It constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted list. For example, if the unique characters are `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - **Decoding**: It decodes the string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the decoded strings for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly maps each character to its symmetric character and constructs the decoded string as expected. The examples provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
