#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether it is possible to reach the second row from the first row for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>'. The function evaluates each test case to determine if it is possible to reach the second row from the first row by following the arrows, and returns a list of strings where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating the result for each test case. The final state of the program includes the original `t` and `test_cases` unchanged, and a new list `results` containing the evaluation results.
