Output State: **`curr` is 0, `nums` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `total` remains unchanged, `mean` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in `nums`, adjusting `curr` by adding the difference between the current element and the `mean`. Since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, and `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, the total sum of the differences between each element and the `mean` over the entire list is zero. This means that after all iterations, `curr` will return to its initial value of 0. The other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
