Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from the standard input, where each pair satisfies `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. For each pair, it modifies a list `nums` by adding and removing specific elements based on the value of `k`. It then prints the length of the modified `nums` list followed by the elements of the list. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of `n` and `k` remains unchanged for each iteration, and the `nums` list is reset for the next iteration. **
