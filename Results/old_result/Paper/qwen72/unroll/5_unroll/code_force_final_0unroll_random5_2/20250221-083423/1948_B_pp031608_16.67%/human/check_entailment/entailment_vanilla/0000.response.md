Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case. For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Initial Check**: The program uses a function `func_1` to check if the array is already sorted. This function compares the original list with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are the same, indicating the array is sorted.

3. **Transformation Logic**: The program iterates through the array and checks if the current element is greater than the next element and if the current element is greater than 10. If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the current element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.

4. **Re-evaluation**: After performing the transformation, the program re-evaluates the array using `func_1` to check if it is now sorted.

5. **Output**: Based on the result of `func_1`, the program prints 'Yes' if the array is sorted, and 'No' otherwise.

However, there are a few issues with the transformation logic:

- **Single Pass Transformation**: The program only performs the transformation once per element. This means that if the transformation of one element creates a new unsorted condition, it will not be corrected in the same pass. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will correctly transform it to `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]` in the first pass, but if the array is `[12, 3, 28, 5]`, it will transform it to `[1, 2, 3, 28, 5]` and then stop, even though further transformations are needed to sort the array.

- **Incorrect Transformation Order**: The program splits the element and inserts the digits in the same position, but it does not handle the case where the split might create a new unsorted condition. For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 28, 5]`, and the program splits `12` into `[1, 2]`, it will insert `1` and `2` at the same position, which might not be the correct order to ensure the array remains sorted.

- **Infinite Loop Potential**: If the transformation is not done correctly, the program might enter an infinite loop where it keeps trying to sort the array without success.

To fix these issues, the transformation logic should be more robust, potentially using a loop to repeatedly apply the transformation until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if arr == sorted(arr):
            return True
        
        # Flag to check if any transformation was made
        transformed = False
        
        # Iterate through the array
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                # Split the element into digits
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                # Remove the original element
                arr.pop(i)
                # Insert the digits in the same position
                for j in range(len(digits)):
                    arr.insert(i + j, digits[j])
                transformed = True
                break
        
        # If no transformation was made, the array cannot be sorted
        if not transformed:
            return False

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version of the program will repeatedly apply the transformation until the array is sorted or it is determined that no further transformations can be made, ensuring that the array is correctly evaluated.
