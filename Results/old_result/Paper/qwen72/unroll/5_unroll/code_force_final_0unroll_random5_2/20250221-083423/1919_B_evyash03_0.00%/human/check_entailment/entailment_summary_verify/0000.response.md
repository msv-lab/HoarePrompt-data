**Reasoning:**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and validate the original assessment:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the `expression` and maintains a `balance` variable that is incremented for each `+` and decremented for each `-`.
   - It counts the number of times the `balance` goes below 0 and resets the `balance` to 0 each time this happens.
   - Finally, it adds 1 to the count if the `balance` is greater than 0 at the end of the iteration.

2. **Problem with the Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.
   - The function only counts the number of times the balance goes below 0 and adds 1 if the final balance is positive. This does not align with the problem's requirement to split the array into subarrays and calculate the penalty based on the sum of the subarrays.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `s = "+-+-+-"`, the function `func_1` will:
     - Start with `balance = 0`.
     - Iterate through the string:
       - `+`: `balance = 1`
       - `-`: `balance = 0`
       - `+`: `balance = 1`
       - `-`: `balance = 0`
       - `+`: `balance = 1`
       - `-`: `balance = 0`
     - Since the `balance` never goes below 0, `count` remains 0.
     - At the end, `balance` is 0, so the function returns `0 + (0 > 0) = 0`.
   - However, the function `func_1` is called with `result_length` which is the sum of the lengths of parts split by `-`. This is not necessary for the problem and introduces an unnecessary parameter.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach to minimize the penalty is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of 0 if possible. This can be achieved by grouping consecutive `+` and `-` characters in pairs.
   - If the total sum of the array is 0, the minimum penalty is 0.
   - If the total sum is not 0, the minimum penalty is the absolute value of the total sum.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided program does not correctly handle the splitting and penalty calculation as required by the problem.
   - The function `func_1` does not follow the correct logic to minimize the penalty.

**Final: False**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as specified.
