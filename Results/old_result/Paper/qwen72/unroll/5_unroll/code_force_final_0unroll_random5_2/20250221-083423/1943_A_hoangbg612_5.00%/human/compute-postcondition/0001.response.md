The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the input integer `T`. For the loop to execute, `T` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
