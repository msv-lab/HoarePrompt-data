Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in the program only considers the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, but it does not account for the correct arrangement that maximizes the beauty of the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be 4, which can be achieved by arranging the array as [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2]. The beauty is calculated as:
- (4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2
- (1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2
- (4 - 1) + (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1
- (1 - 4) + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = -3 + 1 + 1 = -1

However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, but this does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To correctly maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One way to achieve this is to alternate between the largest and smallest elements, which would give the correct output for the given example.
