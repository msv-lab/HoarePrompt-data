The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an array `c` of length `n`, where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` that represent the indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The input constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (number of test cases), 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5 (length of the array and number of queries), 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9 (elements of the array), and 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n (query indices). The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an array `c` of positive integers and a list of queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the indices of a subarray. The function returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether the corresponding subarray is "good" based on the given conditions.**
