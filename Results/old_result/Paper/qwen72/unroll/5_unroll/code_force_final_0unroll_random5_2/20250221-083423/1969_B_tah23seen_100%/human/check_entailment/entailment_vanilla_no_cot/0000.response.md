Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal way to sort the binary string with the minimum cost. The solution only increments the cost when it encounters a '0' after a '1', but it does not consider the cyclic nature of the shifts or the possibility of performing shifts on substrings that could lead to a more efficient sorting.

A correct approach would involve calculating the minimum number of operations required to move all '1's to the right of all '0's, considering the possibility of cyclic shifts. The optimal strategy is to find the longest contiguous segment of '1's and '0's and then calculate the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's that need to be moved.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    # Count the number of '1's in the string
    ones = s.count('1')
    # If the string is already sorted, return 0
    if ones == 0 or ones == n:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the minimum cost to the length of the string
    min_cost = n
    
    # Calculate the cost for each possible cyclic shift
    for i in range(n):
        # Count the number of '0's in the first part of the string
        zeros = s[:i].count('0')
        # Count the number of '1's in the second part of the string
        ones_in_second_part = s[i:].count('1')
        # The cost is the sum of the lengths of the substrings to be shifted
        cost = zeros + ones_in_second_part
        # Update the minimum cost
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
```

This function correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering all possible cyclic shifts and choosing the one with the lowest cost.
