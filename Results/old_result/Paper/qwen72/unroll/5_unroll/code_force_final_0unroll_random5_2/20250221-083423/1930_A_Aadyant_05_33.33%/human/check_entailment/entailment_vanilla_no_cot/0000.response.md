Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect due to the following issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input in a way that is not consistent with the problem description. Specifically, it reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers. However, it does not handle the input correctly, especially when reading the list of integers.

2. **Sorting and Indexing**: The program sorts the list of integers and then selects every second element starting from the first. This approach is incorrect because it does not always ensure that the minimum values are chosen optimally. The correct approach should be to sort the list and then take the first `n` elements, as these will be the smallest `n` elements, which will maximize the sum of the minimum values.

3. **List Deletion**: The program uses `del list1[:]` and `del list2[:]` to clear the lists, which is unnecessary and can be simplified by reinitializing the lists.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    out = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        score = sum(a[:n])
        out.append(score)
    for score in out:
        print(score)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading and Sorting Integers**: For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a`.
3. **Calculating the Score**: The program calculates the score by summing the first `n` elements of the sorted list `a`, which are the smallest `n` elements.
4. **Storing and Printing the Results**: The score for each test case is stored in the `out` list and printed at the end.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.
