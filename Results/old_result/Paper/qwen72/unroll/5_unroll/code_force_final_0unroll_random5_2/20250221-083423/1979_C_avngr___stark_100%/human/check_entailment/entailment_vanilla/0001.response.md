### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th outcome is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - For the condition `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` to hold for all `i`, we need to find a set of `x_i` values such that:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
     \]
   - This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \sum_{j \neq i} x_j < (k_i - 1) \cdot x_i
     \]
   - This means that the sum of the bets on all other outcomes must be less than the bet on the i-th outcome multiplied by `(k_i - 1)`.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set `x_i` such that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.
   - A simple approach is to set `x_i` proportional to the product of all `k_j` values except `k_i`. This ensures that the sum of the other bets is small enough compared to `x_i`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The LCM is used to find a common multiple of all `k_i` values.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the LCM of all `k_i` values.
   - Set `x_i` to be the LCM divided by `k_i`.
   - This ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i` because `x_i` is proportional to the product of all other `k_j` values.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all `k_i` values are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the sum of all bets will be equal to the total amount received back, which does not satisfy the condition. Hence, the output should be `-1` in such cases.

### Correctness:
- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the LCM of the given `k_i` values.
- The approach of setting `x_i` to the LCM divided by `k_i` ensures that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`, satisfying the problem's condition.
- The edge case where all `k_i` values are the same is correctly handled by returning `-1`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
