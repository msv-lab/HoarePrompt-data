### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements).
   - This is a good approach because it allows for efficient frequency counting and comparison.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The initial number of matches is calculated by summing the minimum frequency of each element present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
   - This ensures that the program correctly counts how many elements in the initial window of `a` can be matched with elements in `b`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` one element at a time.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - It checks if the number of matches in the current window is at least `k`.
     - It updates the frequency of the element that is being removed from the window and the element that is being added to the window.
     - It correctly adjusts the `matches` count based on the changes in the window.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program performs a final check to see if the last window (from `a[n-m]` to `a[n-1]`) is a good subarray.
   - This ensures that the last possible subarray is also considered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of good subarrays for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the sliding window approach and the frequency counting logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
