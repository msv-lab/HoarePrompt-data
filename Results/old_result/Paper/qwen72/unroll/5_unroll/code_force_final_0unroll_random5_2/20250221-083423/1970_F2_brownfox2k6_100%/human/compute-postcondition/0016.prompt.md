You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and d is a string representing the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') in which the entity will move. The coordinates in obj must be within the bounds of the field defined by N and M, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside these bounds.
def func_1(obj, d):
    if (d == 'U') :
        obj[0] -= 1
    else :
        if (d == 'D') :
            obj[0] += 1
        else :
            if (d == 'L') :
                obj[1] -= 1
            else :
                if (d == 'R') :
                    obj[1] += 1
                #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('R'). If `d` is 'R', the coordinates in `obj` are now (obj[0], obj[1] + 1), and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. The direction `d` is not 'U', the direction `d` is not 'D', and the direction `d` is not 'L'. If `d` is not 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
            #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('L', 'R'). If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) in `obj` is decreased by 1, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) in `obj` is increased by 1, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged. The direction `d` is not 'U', and the direction `d` is not 'D'.
        #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('L', 'R', 'D'). If `d` is 'D', the first coordinate of `obj` is increased by 1, and the move does not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is 'L', the second integer (y-coordinate) in `obj` is decreased by 1, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is 'R', the second integer (y-coordinate) in `obj` is increased by 1, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged. The direction `d` is not 'U'.
    #State: *`obj` is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, and `d` is a string representing the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). If `d` is 'U', the first integer in `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'D', the first integer in `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second integer in `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second integer in `obj` is increased by 1. In all cases, the move does not result in the entity moving outside the bounds defined by N and M. If `d` is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', the coordinates in `obj` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing coordinates and a string `d` representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It returns the new coordinates of the entity after moving in the specified direction, ensuring the entity stays within the field boundaries defined by N and M.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
