Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the product of all elements in `vals` and stores it in `prod`.

3. **vprod Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. This is intended to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for each outcome.

4. **Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This value is used to check if the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

5. **Output**:
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, the program prints `-1` and returns, indicating that no valid distribution of coins exists.
   - Otherwise, the program prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces, which are the bets for each outcome.

6. **Logical Check**:
   - The key condition to check is whether the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the return for each possible winning outcome.
   - The program ensures this by calculating `vprod` such that the sum of `vprod` is less than `prod`, and then checking if `den` (which is `prod - sum(vprod)`) is greater than 0.
   - If `den` is greater than 0, it means the total bet is less than the return for each outcome, which satisfies the problem's requirement.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.
   - The constraints ensure that the values are within the valid range, and the program's logic should work for these constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
