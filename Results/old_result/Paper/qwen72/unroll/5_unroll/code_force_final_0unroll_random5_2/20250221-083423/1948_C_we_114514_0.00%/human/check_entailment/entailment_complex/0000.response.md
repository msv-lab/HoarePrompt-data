Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the grid dimensions `n` and the arrow configurations for the two rows. Each test case is stored as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in the list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with `t` and `test_cases` as arguments. The function processes each test case to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`. This means the robot starts in the first row and is not yet in the second row.
   - **Loop through Columns**: The function iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it can move to the second row, so `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
       - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
         - The robot can no longer stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
         - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), the robot can move to the second row, so `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
     - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it can stay in the second row, so `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.

4. **Output**: After processing all columns for a test case, the function checks if `reachable_second_row` is `True`. If it is, the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`, and the function appends 'YES' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Final Output**: The main program prints each result in the `results` list, which correctly corresponds to the output format specified in the problem description.

However, there is a logical issue in the function `func_1`:
- The condition `if j == n - 1:` inside the loop is incorrect. The robot should be able to move to the second row from the first row at any column, not just the last column. The correct condition should be to check if the robot can move to the second row and then continue moving right until the end.

Let's correct the logic:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '<':
                    reachable_second_row = False
                elif j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    return results
```

With this corrected logic, the function should correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

Correctness: **False**

The original program has a logical error in the way it handles the robot's movement to the second row and the subsequent movement to the end of the second row. The corrected version should be used to ensure the program works as intended.
