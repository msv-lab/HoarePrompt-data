Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the multipliers are all the same and equal to 2. In such a case, the sum of the bets divided by the multipliers will always be equal to the product of the multipliers, making the denominator zero and leading to incorrect output. For example, if the input is:

```
1
3
2 2 2
```

The program will calculate the product as 8, and the bets as [4, 4, 4]. The sum of the bets is 12, and the denominator becomes 8 - 12 = -4, which is less than or equal to 0. The program will then print -1, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists (e.g., [1, 1, 1]).
