The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string of length `length`, where `length` is an integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000, and `expression` consists only of the characters "+" and "-". The function returns the number of times the balance goes below 0 during the iteration of the loop, plus 1 if the final balance is greater than 0. Otherwise, it returns just the number of times the balance went below 0.
