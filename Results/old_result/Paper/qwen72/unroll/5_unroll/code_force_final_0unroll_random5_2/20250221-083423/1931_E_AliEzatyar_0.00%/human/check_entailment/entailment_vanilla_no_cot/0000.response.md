Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Function Name in Output**:
   - The line `answers[test] = 'Sashah'` contains a typo. It should be `answers[test] = 'Sasha'`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs. However, this does not correctly simulate the game's rules.
   - The game involves reversing digits and concatenating numbers, which can significantly change the values and the number of digits. The program does not account for the optimal play strategy of both players.

3. **Missing Optimal Play Strategy**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal moves for both players. For example, Anna can reverse digits to minimize the number of digits, and Sasha can concatenate numbers to maximize the number of digits.
   - The program should simulate the game or use a more sophisticated approach to determine the winner based on the optimal play.

4. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros, but the program incorrectly uses this information to determine the winner. The number of trailing zeros does not directly impact the game's outcome in the way the program suggests.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

- **Anna's Turn**: Anna can reverse any number, and the number of digits in the list remains the same.
- **Sasha's Turn**: Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, and the number of digits in the list decreases by one.
- **Winning Condition**: Sasha wins if the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

A correct approach would involve:

1. **Counting Digits**: Calculate the total number of digits in the list.
2. **Optimal Play**: Determine if Sasha can always win by ensuring that the final number has at least \(10^m\) digits. This can be done by checking if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\) after an even number of moves (since Anna goes first and the number of moves is always even when Sasha makes the last move).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = sum(len(item) for item in array)
    
    if total_digits >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This program correctly calculates the total number of digits and determines the winner based on whether the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\).
