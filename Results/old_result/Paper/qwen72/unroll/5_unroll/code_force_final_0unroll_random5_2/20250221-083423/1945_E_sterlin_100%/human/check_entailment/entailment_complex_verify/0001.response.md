### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incomplete and does not solve the problem as specified. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input in various formats. However, they are not integrated into the main logic of the program. The program reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case but does not use these inputs to solve the problem.

2. **Missing Logic**:
   - **Finding the Position of \( x \)**: The program does not find the position of the target element \( x \) in the permutation.
   - **Determining the Positions to Swap**: The program does not determine the positions to swap to make the permutation suitable for binary search.
   - **Performing the Binary Search**: The program does not perform the binary search algorithm.
   - **Ensuring Correctness**: The program does not ensure that after the binary search, \( p_l \) is equal to \( x \).

3. **Output**: The program does not produce any output that indicates the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The output is a crucial part of the problem, and the program fails to generate it.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. It only reads input and does not perform the necessary operations to rearrange the permutation, perform binary search, or produce the required output.
