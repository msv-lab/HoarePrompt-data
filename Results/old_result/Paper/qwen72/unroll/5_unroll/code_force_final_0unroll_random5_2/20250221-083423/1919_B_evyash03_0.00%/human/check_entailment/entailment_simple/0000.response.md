### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - The string `s` represents an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - The goal is to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.
   - It then splits the string `expression` by the character `-` and calculates the sum of the lengths of the resulting parts.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the `expression` and the `result_length`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments the `balance` by 1.
   - If the character is `-`, it decrements the `balance` by 1.
   - If the `balance` goes below 0, it increments the `count` by 1 and resets the `balance` to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`, which means it adds 1 to the count if the final balance is greater than 0.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of times the balance goes below 0, which corresponds to the number of subarrays needed to reset the balance to 0.
   - If the final balance is greater than 0, it means there is an additional subarray that needs to be counted.
   - However, the program does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The penalty is calculated based on the sum of the subarrays and their lengths, not just the number of times the balance goes below 0.

5. **Optimal Solution**:
   - To minimize the penalty, the optimal strategy is to split the array such that each subarray has a sum of 0 or as close to 0 as possible.
   - The given program does not implement this strategy. Instead, it only counts the number of times the balance goes below 0 and adds 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - This approach does not always yield the minimum possible penalty.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `+`
  - The array is `[1]`.
  - The optimal split is `[1]`, and the penalty is `1 * 1 = 1`.
  - The program returns `1`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `-----`
  - The array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`.
  - The optimal split is `[-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1]`, and the penalty is `1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 + 1 * 1 = 5`.
  - The program returns `5`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 3**: `+-+-+-`
  - The array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`.
  - The optimal split is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, and the penalty is `0 * 6 = 0`.
  - The program returns `0`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4**: `--+++++++`
  - The array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`.
  - The optimal split is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, and the penalty is `4 * 10 = 40`.
  - The program returns `4`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be `40`.

- **Test Case 5**: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
  - The array is `[1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1]`.
  - The optimal split is more complex, but the program does not correctly handle this case.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always return the correct minimum penalty for all test cases. It fails to consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
