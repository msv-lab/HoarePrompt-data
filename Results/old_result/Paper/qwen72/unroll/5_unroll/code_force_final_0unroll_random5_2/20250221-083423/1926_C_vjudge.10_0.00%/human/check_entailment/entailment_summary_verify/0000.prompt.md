You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and returns the sum of its digits. After the function concludes, the program has computed the sum of the individual digits of the integer `n` and returned this sum as an integer.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line of input contains an integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of test cases. Each of the following \( t \) lines contains a single integer \( n \) (1 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 2 · 10^5). The program, however, reads a single integer \( N \) and then iterates \( N \) times, which is incorrect. 

Additionally, the program does not reset the `soma` variable for each test case, which means the sum from previous test cases will accumulate, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n in test_cases:
        soma = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            soma += sum(int(d) for d in str(i))
        results.append(soma)
    return results

# Example usage
t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = sum_of_digit_sums(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This version correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently, ensuring that the sum is reset for each new test case.
