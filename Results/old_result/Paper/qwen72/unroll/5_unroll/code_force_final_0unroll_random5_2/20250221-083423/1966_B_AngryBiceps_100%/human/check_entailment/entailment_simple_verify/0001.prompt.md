You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the dimensions and the grid, and checks the conditions for the first and last rows and columns. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop prints 'NO' if the conditions are not met, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times m \) grid of white ('W') and black ('B') squares.
   - We can perform operations where we select two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of these operations.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the first row and the last row of the grid are already the same color, or if the first column and the last column of the grid are already the same color, then it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - If the first row and the last row are different colors, or if the first column and the last column are different colors, then it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color using the given operations.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and constructs a list of strings `a` representing the grid.
   - It also constructs two strings: `first_row` (the first character of each row) and `last_row` (the last character of each row).
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If the first row and the last row are the same color but different from each other.
     - If the first column and the last column are the same color but different from each other.
   - If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The conditions checked by the program are sufficient to determine if it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - If the first row and the last row are the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because the subrectangle operations cannot change the color of the entire grid to a single color if the first and last rows are different.
   - Similarly, if the first column and the last column are the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color for the same reason.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where \( n \) or \( m \) is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the grid is already the same color correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
