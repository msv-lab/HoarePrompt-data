The function `find_subarrays` accepts three parameters: `a`, `n`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length `2n` containing each integer from 1 to `n` exactly twice. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function returns a list of subarrays from `a` where each subarray has a length of `2k` and contains each integer from 1 to `k` exactly twice.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers of length `2n`, an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50,000), and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). It returns a list of subarrays from `a` where each subarray has a length of `2k` and contains each integer from 1 to `k` exactly twice.**
