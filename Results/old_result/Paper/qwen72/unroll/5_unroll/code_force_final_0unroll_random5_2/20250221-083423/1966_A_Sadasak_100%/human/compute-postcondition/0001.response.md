The only objects in the loop head are the list `arr` and the variable `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state of `num` will be the first element of `arr` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i.
- `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100.
- `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `num` should be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 100 and 1 <= arr[i] <= 100 for all i, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 100, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `arr`**
