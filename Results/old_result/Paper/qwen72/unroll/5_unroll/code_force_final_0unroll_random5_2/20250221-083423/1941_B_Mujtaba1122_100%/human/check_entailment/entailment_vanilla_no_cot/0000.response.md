Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect due to several issues:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - In `func_2`, the operation is applied incorrectly. The program attempts to decrement `list[i + 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i - 1]` by multiples of `list[i - 1]`, which is not the correct way to apply the operation. The operation should decrement `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - The `while` loop in `func_2` can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the conditions are not met correctly. For example, if `list[i]` is odd and `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are not sufficient to make `list[i]` zero, the loop will continue indefinitely.

3. **Incorrect Final Check**:
   - The final check in `func_2` using `func_1` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made zero. The function should check if all elements are zero after applying the operations, but the way the operations are applied in `func_2` is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the array can be made zero by applying the given operation. The key observation is that the sum of the elements in the array must be divisible by 4 for it to be possible to make all elements zero. Additionally, the elements must be non-negative and the operation should be applied in a way that maintains non-negativity.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(n, arr):
    # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
    if sum(arr) % 4 != 0:
        return "NO"
    
    # Check if the array can be made zero
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] > 1 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    
    # Final check if all elements are zero
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != 0:
            return "NO"
    return "YES"

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(can_make_zero(n, arr))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sum Check**:
   - The function `can_make_zero` first checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it returns "NO" immediately because it is impossible to make all elements zero.

2. **Operation Application**:
   - The function then iterates through the array and applies the operation as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the operation is applied only when the conditions are met, and it decrements the elements correctly.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After applying the operations, the function checks if all elements are zero. If any element is non-zero, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operations.
