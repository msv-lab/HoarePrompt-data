You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends for each friend.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case. For each test case, it checks if there is a pair of indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The variables `i` and `j` are reset to `0` at the beginning of each test case. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 after each test case, and the loop continues until `t` reaches 0. The list `l` and the integer `n` are updated for each test case based on the input. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user for a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `l`. It then checks if there is a pair of consecutive indices `i` and `i+1` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and stops checking further for that test case. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the corresponding results have been printed. The input variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used in the function as provided, and the function does not modify any external state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The best friend of the i-th friend is given by \( p_i \), and \( p_i \neq i \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends \( n \) and the list \( l \) of best friends.
   - It initializes two variables: \( i \) (to iterate through the list) and \( j \) (to check if a specific condition is met).
   - It then enters a while loop to iterate through the list \( l \) and checks if \( l[i] == i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] == i + 1 \).
   - If this condition is met, it prints 2 and sets \( j \) to 1, breaking out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without meeting the condition, it prints 3.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The condition \( l[i] == i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] == i + 1 \) checks if the i-th friend's best friend is the (i+2)-th friend and the (i+1)-th friend's best friend is the i-th friend. This is a specific case where two friends are each other's best friends.
   - If this condition is met, the program correctly prints 2 because sending invitations to these two friends will ensure both come to the party.
   - However, the program does not handle other cases where the minimum number of invitations might be different. For example, if the friends form a cycle of length 3 or more, the program will always print 3, which might not be the correct answer.

4. **Identifying the Flaw:**
   - The program only checks for a specific pattern (two friends being each other's best friends) and prints 2 if found.
   - It does not consider other possible scenarios, such as cycles of length 3 or more, where the minimum number of invitations might be less than 3.
   - Therefore, the program is not general enough to handle all valid inputs as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only checks for a specific pattern and does not handle other valid scenarios where the minimum number of invitations might be different.
