To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `tests`. The loop will execute if `tests` is greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `tests` is an input integer, and the function takes no parameters but is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The loop will execute if `tests` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`i` is 0, `tests` must be greater than 0**
