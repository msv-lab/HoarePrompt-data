Reasoning:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `N` but does not handle each test case separately. Instead, it accumulates the sum of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it at the end. This is incorrect because the problem requires the sum for each test case to be printed individually.

2. **Range Issue**: The inner loop iterates from `0` to `n-1` instead of `1` to `n`. This means the program is missing the digit sum of `n` itself. For example, if `n = 12`, the loop will only consider the numbers `0` to `11`, missing the digit sum of `12`.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The program should reset the sum for each test case, but it does not. This means the sum from previous test cases will be added to the sum of the current test case, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is correctly defined to return the sum of the digits of a number, but it is called with `i` instead of `i + 1` to match the range from `1` to `n`.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Read the number of test cases `t` and handle each test case separately.
- Reset the sum for each test case.
- Iterate from `1` to `n` inclusive.
- Print the sum for each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    soma = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
