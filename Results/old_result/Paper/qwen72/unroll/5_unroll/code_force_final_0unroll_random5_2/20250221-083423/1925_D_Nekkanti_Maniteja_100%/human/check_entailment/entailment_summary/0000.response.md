Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Modulo Calculation**: The function uses \(10^9 + 7\) as the modulo value, which is required by the problem.

3. **Probability Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs uniformly at random, and the probability of choosing any specific pair is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\).

4. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**: The variable `a` correctly accumulates the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion. However, there is a logical error in the loop where the expected value is calculated. The formula used in the loop is:
   \[
   s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
   \]
   This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
   \[
   s = s + c \cdot (a + i \cdot m)
   \]
   Here, `a` is the sum of the initial friendship values, and `i * m` is the additional friendship value accumulated by the end of the i-th excursion. The term `c * (a + i * m)` correctly represents the expected value of the friendship value for the i-th excursion.

6. **Final Output**: The function prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

Given the logical error in the expected value calculation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
