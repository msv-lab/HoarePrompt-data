Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variable `tests` remains unchanged as it was the input integer. The variables `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain the values of the last test case processed. The variable `no` will be `False` if any of the test cases resulted in a 'YES' print statement, otherwise it will be `True`. The variable `counter` will be equal to the length of the last processed string `c`.**
