### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

2. **Password Analysis:**
   - The program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes immediately after a letter in the password.

3. **Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
     - This is implicitly handled by the input constraints and the fact that the program only processes characters that are either digits or letters.
   - **Condition 2:** There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
     - The program checks this by iterating through the password and ensuring that if a character is a letter, the next character is not a digit.
   - **Condition 3:** All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.
     - The program checks this by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
   - **Condition 4:** All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.
     - The program checks this by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

4. **Output:**
   - If any of the conditions fail, the program returns "NO".
   - If all conditions are satisfied, the program returns "YES".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to verify the strength of the password based on the given conditions. It handles all the required checks and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
