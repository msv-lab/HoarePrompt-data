Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the program only attempts to split the element `arr[i - 1]` when it finds that `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`. However, it does not consider the possibility of splitting `arr[i]` or any other elements that might be necessary to achieve a sorted array. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 0
```

The program will fail on the second test case:
```
3
12 28 5
```

The correct output should be `NO` because no matter how you split the elements, you cannot make the array sorted. However, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because it only checks the split of `arr[i - 1]` and does not consider the split of `arr[i]` or any other elements that might be necessary to achieve a sorted array.
