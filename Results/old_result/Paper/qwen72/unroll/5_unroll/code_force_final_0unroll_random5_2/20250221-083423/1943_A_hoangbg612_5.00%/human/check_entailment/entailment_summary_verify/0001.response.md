### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good approach because it helps in efficiently finding the MEX by ensuring that we can check the smallest missing integer in a sequential manner.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX:**
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1. This variable will be used to track the current MEX value as the game progresses.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Iterating Through the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - For each number `num` in the array:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is exactly `cur + 1`. If it is, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it means there is a gap in the sequence, and the MEX is `cur + 1`. The program then breaks out of the loop.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If it does, it means all numbers from 0 to `cur` are present, and the MEX is `cur + 1`.
   - The program then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of any number `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If it finds such a number, it updates `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `cur`, which is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The program's logic is based on the idea that Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will always try to pick the smallest number that can extend the sequence, and Bob will try to pick the smallest number that can break the sequence.
  - However, the program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. Instead, it only checks the sorted array and updates the MEX based on the counts of numbers, which does not account for the strategic choices of the players.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the array is empty or contains only one element.
  - It also correctly handles cases where the array contains repeated elements.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The subsequent iteration through the sorted array and dictionary operations are linear, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\).

### Correctness:

- **Flaw in Logic:**
  - The program does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob. It simply checks the sorted array and updates the MEX based on the counts of numbers, which does not reflect the optimal play strategy of the players.
  - For example, in the test case `N = [0, 0, 1, 1]`, the program will output 2, but the optimal play would result in a different MEX. Alice and Bob would play as follows:
    - Alice picks 0, `N = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
    - Bob picks 0, `N = [1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
    - Alice picks 1, `N = [1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
    - Bob picks 1, `N = []`, `c = [0, 1]`.
    - The MEX of `c` is 2, but the program does not correctly simulate this sequence of moves.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. The logic for determining the MEX is flawed and does not account for the strategic choices of Alice and Bob.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
