The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is a non-negative integer representing the current time step in the game. It also accepts two dictionaries, `player` and `blud`, where the keys are strings representing player identifiers (e.g., 'R0', 'B1') and the values are lists of integers representing the current positions of the players and the Bludgers on the field. The positions are valid and within the bounds of the field.

The function returns the following based on the input parameters:
- Case_1: If `t` is 0, the function returns a message indicating the start of the game.
- Case_2: If `t` is greater than 0, the function returns the current positions of the players and Bludgers.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `t` and two dictionaries `player` and `blud`. If `t` is 0, it returns a message indicating the start of the game. If `t` is greater than 0, it returns the current positions of the players and Bludgers.**
