Initial State:
- The `sequence` will have the values `overlap, overlap + 1, overlap + 2, ..., size - 1` appended to it.
- The values of `size`, `overlap`, and `size_overlap` will remain unchanged.
- The value of `number` will also remain unchanged.

Code Snippet:
```
func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet calls the function `func_1` with two arguments:
1. The first argument is `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.
2. The second argument is `sequence`.

The values of `size`, `overlap`, and `number` are used in the calculation of the first argument, but they remain unchanged. The `sequence` is passed as the second argument, and it also remains unchanged.

Output State: **The `sequence` will have the values `overlap, overlap + 1, overlap + 2, ..., size - 1` appended to it. The values of `size`, `overlap`, and `size_overlap` will remain unchanged. The value of `number` will also remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`.**
