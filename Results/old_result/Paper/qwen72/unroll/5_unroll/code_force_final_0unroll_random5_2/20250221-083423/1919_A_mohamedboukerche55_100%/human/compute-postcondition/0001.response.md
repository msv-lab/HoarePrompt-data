The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `a` and `b` does not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
