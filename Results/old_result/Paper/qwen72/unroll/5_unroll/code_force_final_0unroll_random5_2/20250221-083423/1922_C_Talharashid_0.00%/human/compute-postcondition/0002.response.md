Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the list `a` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the cumulative minimum distances for each index in the list `a` when traversing from the start to the end and from the end to the start, respectively. For each query, the minimum distance between the two specified cities is printed.**
