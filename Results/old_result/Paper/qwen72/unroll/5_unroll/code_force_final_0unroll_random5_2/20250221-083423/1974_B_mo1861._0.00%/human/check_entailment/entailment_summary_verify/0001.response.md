### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The string `s` is encoded by constructing a new string `r` that consists of all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", then 'a' is replaced by 'c', 'b' is replaced by 'b', and 'c' is replaced by 'a'.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode the string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We first need to construct the string `r` from the distinct characters in `b` in alphabetical order.
   - Then, we create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `num_chars` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1(b)`:**
   - The function constructs a set of distinct characters from `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It then constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

5. **Error in the Program:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program uses `len(b)` instead of `len(r)` when creating the symmetric mapping.
   - This is indeed a mistake because the symmetric replacement should be based on the length of `r`, not `b`.

6. **Corrected Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should be from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", the mapping should be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'o'
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'

7. **Corrected Program:**
   - The corrected program should use `len(r)` instead of `len(b)` when creating the symmetric mapping.
   - The correct implementation of `func_1` should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(b):
         """
         Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

         Args:
             b (str): The encoded string.

         Returns:
             str: The decoded string s.
         """
         r = sorted(set(b))
         char_map = {r[i]: r[len(r) - i - 1] for i in range(len(r))}
         s = ''.join(char_map[c] for c in b)
         return s
     ```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it uses the length of the encoded string `b` to create the symmetric mapping, which is not the correct approach. The symmetric mapping should be based on the length of the distinct characters in `b` (i.e., the length of `r`).

Final: **False**
