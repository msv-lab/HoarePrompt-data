Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the minimum number of days (operations) needed to transform the initial state of the boxes `s1` into the desired state `s2`. The operations allowed are:
1. Adding a cat to a box that currently has no cat.
2. Removing a cat from a box that currently has a cat.
3. Moving a cat from one box to another.

The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`). The minimum number of operations required is the maximum of these two values because:
- If more cats need to be added than removed, the number of days is determined by the number of cats to add.
- If more cats need to be removed than added, the number of days is determined by the number of cats to remove.
- If the number of cats to add and remove is the same, the number of days is equal to this number.

This approach is correct because:
- Each cat that needs to be added must be placed in a box, and each cat that needs to be removed must be taken out of a box.
- Moving a cat from one box to another does not change the total number of cats, so it does not affect the count of `cats_to_add` or `cats_to_remove`.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the required number of operations for each test case, and the main loop correctly processes multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
