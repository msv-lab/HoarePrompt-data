The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop's execution depends on the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state of the function `func` and its parameters `t`, `n`, and `x` are not directly part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted here. However, the input should be consistent with the function's requirements.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
