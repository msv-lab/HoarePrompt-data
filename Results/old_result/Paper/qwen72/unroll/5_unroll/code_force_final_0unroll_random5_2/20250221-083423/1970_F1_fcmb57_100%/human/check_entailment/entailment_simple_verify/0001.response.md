### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field (`n` and `m`).
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players and a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It correctly parses the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.

2. **Movement Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of moves (`moves`) and then processes each move.
   - For each move, it checks if the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) or a throw (`T`).

3. **Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle the movement of players. It takes the current position and a direction, and returns the new position.
   - The movement is correctly calculated by adding the direction vector to the current position.
   - However, the annotated code mentions a potential issue with the function `func_1` where it states that `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. This is incorrect because `b` is actually a tuple representing the direction vector, as defined in the `mouvements` dictionary. Therefore, the function `func_1` is correctly implemented and will not raise a `TypeError`.

4. **Scoring Logic:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the program checks if the player is at a goal position.
   - If the player is at a goal of the opposite team, the correct team scores a point and the event is printed.
   - If the player is at a goal of their own team, the opposite team scores a point and the event is printed.
   - The program correctly handles the scoring logic and prints the appropriate events.

5. **Quaffle Position:**
   - The program does not explicitly track the position of the Quaffle. Instead, it assumes that the Quaffle is always carried by a player or at a goal. This is a valid assumption given the problem constraints.
   - The program does not reset the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. However, since the problem guarantees that the Quaffle is always at a valid position and the next action will be valid, this is not an issue.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format for the events and the final score is correct and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input, process the moves, and output the events and final score as required by the problem statement. The annotated code's concern about the `func_1` function raising a `TypeError` is unfounded, as the function is correctly implemented and will not cause any issues. Given the constraints and the guarantees provided, the program is correct.
