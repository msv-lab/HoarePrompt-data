#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer, and `q` queries, each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` that represent the indices of a subarray of `c`. The function should determine if each subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The input constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is the cumulative sum of `1` if `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise, starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of the original `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is the cumulative sum of `1` if the original `a[i] > 1` and `2` otherwise, starting from `b[0] = 0`. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an array `c` of length `n` and processes `q` queries. Each query consists of two indices `l_i` and `r_i` that define a subarray of `c`. The function calculates and prints 'YES' if the subarray is "good" based on the condition that the sum of the subarray elements in `c` is not less than the sum of a transformed subarray where each element is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element in `c` is greater than 1, 2 otherwise). If the condition is not met or if `l_i` equals `r_i`, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.
