You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It then reads the input for each test case and processes it.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array:**
   - The function iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If not, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element:
     - It splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If so, it appends `y` and `x` to `c` in that order.
     - If not, it appends the original element `a[i]` to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if it is equal to the transformed list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

5. **Output:**
   - The program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Transformation Logic:**
  - The transformation logic is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the splitting of elements greater than 10 and their insertion into the array.
  - Specifically, the conditions for splitting and appending digits are not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted. For example, if the array is `[12, 28, 5]`, the program will not correctly determine that it cannot be sorted.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the array might already be sorted or where multiple elements need to be split and inserted in a specific order to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the given operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
