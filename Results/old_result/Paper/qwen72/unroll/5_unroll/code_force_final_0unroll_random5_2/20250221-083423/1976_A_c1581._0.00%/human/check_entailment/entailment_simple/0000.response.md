Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the password and the password itself. This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format.

2. **Character Classification**: Inside `func_1`, the program separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` for digits and `letters` for lowercase Latin letters. This ensures that we can check the sorting conditions for each type of character separately.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program uses a variable `last_digit_index` to track the last index where a digit was found. If a letter is found after a digit, the program immediately returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

4. **Sorting Checks**: The program checks if the `digits` list and the `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, the program returns 'NO'. This ensures that the password meets the sorting conditions for both digits and letters.

5. **Final Return**: If all conditions are met, the program returns 'YES'.

The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description:
- It ensures that the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- It ensures that no digit comes after a letter.
- It ensures that all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It ensures that all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the problem constraints and the provided test cases, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
