The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr` of length `m`. It prints 'YES' if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element, and 'NO' otherwise. The number of test cases `t` is not explicitly managed within the function, and the function does not return any value. The internal state of the function (variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans`) is reset for each iteration of the outer loop, which runs `n` times. The variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.
