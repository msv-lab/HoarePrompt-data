### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), the return is \(k_i \times x_i\), where \(x_i\) is the bet on outcome \(i\).
   - The total bet is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\).
   - The condition to satisfy is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
     - It is correctly implemented using the formula \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers.
     - It iterates through the list and applies `func_1` to each pair of numbers, updating the result accordingly.
     - The final result is the LCM of all numbers in the list.

   - **Main Logic**:
     - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
     - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(n\) and the multipliers \(k\).
     - It computes the LCM of the multipliers \(k\) and stores it in `m`.
     - It then computes the bets \(x_i\) as \(m // k_i\) for each outcome \(i\).
     - It checks if the sum of the bets \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\) is less than \(m\). If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

3. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - **Correctness of LCM Calculation**:
     - The LCM calculation is correct and ensures that the bets \(x_i\) are integers.
     - The LCM of the multipliers \(k\) is used to ensure that the bets are consistent with the multipliers.

   - **Checking the Condition**:
     - The program checks if \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m\).
     - If this condition is satisfied, the program prints the bets.
     - If not, it prints \(-1\).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Example 1**:
     - Input: 
       ```
       1
       3
       3 2 7
       ```
     - The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42.
     - The bets are \(42 // 3 = 14\), \(42 // 2 = 21\), and \(42 // 7 = 6\).
     - The total bet is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is less than 42.
     - The returns are \(3 \times 14 = 42\), \(2 \times 21 = 42\), and \(7 \times 6 = 42\), all of which are equal to 42.
     - Since the total bet is less than the return for each outcome, the program should print the bets, but it prints \(-1\) because the sum of bets is not strictly less than the LCM.

   - **Example 2**:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       2
       3 3
       ```
     - The LCM of 3 and 3 is 3.
     - The bets are \(3 // 3 = 1\) and \(3 // 3 = 1\).
     - The total bet is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than 3.
     - The returns are \(3 \times 1 = 3\) and \(3 \times 1 = 3\), both of which are equal to 3.
     - The program should print the bets, but it prints \(-1\) because the sum of bets is not strictly less than the LCM.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for computing the LCM and the bets is correct.
   - However, the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < m\) is too strict. It should be \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \times x_i\) for all \(i\).
   - The program fails to produce the correct output for some valid inputs because it uses the LCM as the threshold for the total bet, which is not always the correct approach.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it uses the LCM as a threshold for the total bet, which is not always the correct approach to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The condition should be checked for each individual outcome, not the LCM of all multipliers.
