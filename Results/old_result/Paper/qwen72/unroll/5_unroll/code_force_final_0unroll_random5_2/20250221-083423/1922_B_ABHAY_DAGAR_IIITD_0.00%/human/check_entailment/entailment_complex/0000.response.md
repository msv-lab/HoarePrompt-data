Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls the function `func_1(t)`. Inside `func_1`, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list` for each test case.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**: The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent. This is a correct approach to determine how many sticks of each length are available.

3. **Triangle Formation Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a triangle using the sticks.
   - For each unique exponent `x` with a count `cnt`:
     - If `cnt >= 3`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`.
     - If `cnt >= 2`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the formula `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`, where `total_count` is the cumulative count of all previously processed sticks.
     - It then updates `total_count` by adding the count of the current exponent.

4. **Output**: The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints each result after processing all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 1` (no triangles can be formed).
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple sticks of the same length and different lengths, as demonstrated in the example test cases.

6. **Mathematical Validity**:
   - The program correctly uses the combination formulas to count the number of ways to choose sticks.
   - The conditions for forming a non-degenerate triangle are implicitly handled by the combination formulas, as the lengths of the sticks are powers of 2, and the triangle inequality theorem is satisfied when the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
