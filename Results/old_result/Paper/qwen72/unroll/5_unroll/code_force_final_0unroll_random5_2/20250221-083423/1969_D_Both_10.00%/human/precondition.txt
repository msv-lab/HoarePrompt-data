The function `inp` is not defined with any parameters, and it is expected to handle input reading and processing for multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and k, followed by two lists of integers a and b, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
