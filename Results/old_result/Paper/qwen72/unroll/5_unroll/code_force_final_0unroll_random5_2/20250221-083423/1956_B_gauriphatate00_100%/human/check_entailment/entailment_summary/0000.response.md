Reasoning:

The problem involves a card game where you and Nene take turns to place cards on the table, and you want to maximize your score while Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key to solving this problem is to understand that Nene will always play optimally, which means she will try to score points whenever possible and prevent you from scoring points if she can.

The function `func_1` in the provided program calculates the maximum number of points you can get by counting how many unique integers in your hand appear exactly twice. This is because if you have a card with an integer that appears exactly twice in your hand, you can score a point by playing the second card of that integer after Nene has already played the first one (assuming Nene has the first one, which is a reasonable assumption since she plays optimally).

However, the function does not consider the following:
1. **Nene's Optimal Play**: The function assumes that you will score a point for every integer that appears twice in your hand, but it does not account for Nene's optimal play. Nene will always play a card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours. If she has a card that you also have, she will play it first to prevent you from scoring.
2. **Turn Order and Strategy**: The function does not consider the turn order or the strategy of playing cards. It simply counts the number of integers that appear twice in your hand, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum score you can achieve given Nene's optimal play.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Count the number of unique integers in your hand.
- Determine how many of these integers Nene also has.
- Calculate the maximum score you can achieve by considering Nene's optimal play.

Given the current implementation, the function `func_1` is not considering Nene's optimal play and the turn order, which are crucial for the correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
