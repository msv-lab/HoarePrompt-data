Output State: **The loop does not directly modify the variables `curr`, `parent`, or `path`. However, it may return a path if a condition is met. If the loop completes all iterations without returning, the state remains: `curr` is a vertex in the graph, `parent` is the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal (or None if `curr` is the root), `path` is a list of vertices representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, and the color of `curr` is 1.**
