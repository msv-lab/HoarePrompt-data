Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `k` is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of integers read from the input, `prod` is 1.**

The variable `prod` is initialized to 1, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `N`, and `vals` remain unchanged.
