Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. results is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test_case in test_cases:
    n, (row1, row2) = test_case
    reachable_first_row = True
    reachable_second_row = False
    for j in range(n):
        if reachable_first_row:
            if row1[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
            else:
                reachable_first_row = False
                if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            if row2[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
