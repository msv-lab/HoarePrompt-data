Output State: **number is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, sequence is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], and size_overlap is (0, 0).** 

The initial state of `number` and `sequence` remains unchanged. The variable `size_overlap` is now a tuple with both elements set to 0.
