### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input (stdin).
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line.
   - Each line is split into two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `k >= 2`.
   - If `k >= 2`, it further checks if `n == k`.
     - If `n == k`, it prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`.
     - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`.
   - If `k < 2` (i.e., `k == 1`), it prints an array of `n` elements, where each element is `j + 1` for `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `k == 1`, the program prints the array `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.
     - This array is sorted, and its only sorted cyclic shift is itself.
     - Therefore, this case is correct.

   - **Case 2: `k >= 2` and `n == k`**
     - If `n == k`, the program prints an array of `n` elements, all equal to `k`.
     - This array is sorted, and all its cyclic shifts are also sorted because all elements are the same.
     - Therefore, this case is correct.

   - **Case 3: `k >= 2` and `n != k`**
     - If `n != k`, the program prints `-1`.
     - This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for `k >= 2` and `n != k`. For example, for `n = 4` and `k = 2`, the array `[1, 1, 2, 2]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 1, 1]`.
     - The program fails to generate such valid arrays and instead prints `-1`, which is not the correct behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` correctly. It incorrectly prints `-1` for such cases, even though valid arrays can exist.

### Final:
**False**
