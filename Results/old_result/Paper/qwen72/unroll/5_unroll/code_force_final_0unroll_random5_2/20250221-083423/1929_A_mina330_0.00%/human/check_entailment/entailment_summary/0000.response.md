### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of an array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element to the last. To maximize this beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

Given the array `a`:
- Sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the differences between the largest and smallest elements for each pair from the start and end of the list, moving towards the center, is a valid approach to maximize the beauty.
- This is because the largest elements will be paired with the smallest elements, thus maximizing the differences.

Let's break down the logic in the provided program:
1. **Reading Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases `ntest` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Input for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
4. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements for each pair from the start and end of the sorted list, moving towards the center.
5. **Output**: The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the largest and smallest elements are paired, which maximizes the differences.
- The loop `for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1)` correctly pairs elements from the start and end of the sorted list.
- The sum of these differences is the maximum possible beauty for the array.

### Correctness:
**True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.
