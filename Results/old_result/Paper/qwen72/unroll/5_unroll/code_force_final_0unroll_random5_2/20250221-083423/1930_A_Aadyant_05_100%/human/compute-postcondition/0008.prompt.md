You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        
        list2 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        list1 = []
        
        b = input()
        
        list1 = b.split()
        
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        
        list2.sort()
        
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        
        final.append(s)
        
    #State: The `final` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the sum of the sorted even-indexed integers from the corresponding input list. The variable `num` will be equal to `int(n) - 1`. The variables `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be reset to their final values from the last iteration of the loop.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: Output State: The `final` list will contain `t` elements, where each element is the sum of the sorted even-indexed integers from the corresponding input list. The variable `num` will be equal to `int(n) - 1`. The variables `s`, `list2`, `a`, `b`, and `list1` will be reset to their final values from the last iteration of the loop. The loop will have printed each element of the `final` list, one per line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `cases`, where each inner list contains 2n integers. It returns a list of strings, where each string is "Yes" if the pairs of integers in the corresponding test case can be rearranged to be equal, or "No" otherwise.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
