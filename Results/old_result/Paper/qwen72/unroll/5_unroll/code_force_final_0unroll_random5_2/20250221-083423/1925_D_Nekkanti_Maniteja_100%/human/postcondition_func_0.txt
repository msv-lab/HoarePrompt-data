The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it calculates a specific sum based on the number of children (`n`), the number of pairs of friends (`m`), and the number of excursions (`k`). It then prints the result of this sum modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, and `c` retain their values, and the variable `a` holds the sum of all initial friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.
