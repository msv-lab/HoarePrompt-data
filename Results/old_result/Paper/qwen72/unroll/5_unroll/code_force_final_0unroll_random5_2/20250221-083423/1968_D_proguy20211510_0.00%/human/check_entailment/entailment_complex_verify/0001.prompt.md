You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop processes each test case, updating the starting positions `pb` and `ps` as well as the arrays `b` and `s` for each iteration. After all iterations, the loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the maximum scores calculated for Bodya and Sasha. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a game between Bodya and Sasha. It takes inputs for the number of test cases, the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, the permutation, and an array of values. For each test case, it determines the winner of the game based on the maximum values in the array and the movement of Bodya and Sasha according to the permutation. The function prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case, indicating the winner or if the game ends in a draw. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes two boolean variables `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has found the maximum value in `a`.
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns:
     - If both players have found the maximum value, it appends the remaining turns' scores as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` to both lists and breaks out of the loop.
     - If only Bodya has found the maximum value, it appends `maxa` to `b` for the remaining turns.
     - If only Sasha has found the maximum value, it appends `maxa` to `s` for the remaining turns.
     - If neither has found the maximum value, it appends the current position's value in `a` to the respective list and updates the position based on the permutation `p`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the potential final scores for each player by considering the remaining turns and the maximum value in `a`.

5. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum potential final scores for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, and "Draw" if they are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `maxa`:**
  - The program incorrectly assumes that once a player reaches the maximum value in `a`, they will always stay at that position and collect `maxa` for the remaining turns. This is not necessarily true because the player can choose to stay or move to `p_x`.
  - The program should simulate the game more accurately by considering the player's choice to stay or move at each turn.

- **Inefficient Simulation:**
  - The program simulates the game for `k` turns, which can be inefficient for large `k` (up to \(10^9\)).
  - A more efficient approach would be to detect cycles in the permutation and use the cycle length to determine the scores for the remaining turns.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the game as described in the problem statement. It makes incorrect assumptions about the players' movements and does not handle large values of `k` efficiently.

### Correctness:
**False**
