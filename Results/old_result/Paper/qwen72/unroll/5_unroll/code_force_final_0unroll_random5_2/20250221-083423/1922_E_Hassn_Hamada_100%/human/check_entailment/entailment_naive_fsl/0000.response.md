Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `X` is a power of 2. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers that can form exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the logic used to determine the sequence length and elements is flawed when `X` is a power of 2.

For example, consider the input `X = 4` (which is \(2^2\)). The program should generate an array that has exactly 4 increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation will not correctly handle this case because the loop and the conditions inside `func_1` do not account for the specific properties of powers of 2.

To illustrate, let's walk through the logic for `X = 4`:
1. `n = 4 - 1 = 3`
2. The loop in `func_1` will start with `i = 0` and try to find a `size` such that \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) \leq 3\).
3. For `i = 0`, \((1 << 1) - (1 << 0) = 1\), which is less than 3.
4. For `i = 0`, \((1 << 2) - (1 << 0) = 3\), which is equal to 3.
5. The function will append `0` and `1` to the sequence.
6. The recursive call `func_1(3 - 3, sequence)` will be made, which is `func_1(0, sequence)`.
7. The base case `number == 0` will be reached, and the function will return.

The resulting sequence will be `[0, 1]`, which has 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. However, the problem requires exactly 4 increasing subsequences, which the program fails to generate.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the case where `X` is a power of 2.
