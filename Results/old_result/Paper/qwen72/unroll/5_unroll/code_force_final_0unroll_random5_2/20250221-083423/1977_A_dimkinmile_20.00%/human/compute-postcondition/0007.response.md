Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. It then compares these integers and prints 'Yes' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and prints 'No' if `n` is less than `m`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed result ('Yes' or 'No') based on the comparison of `n` and `m`. **
