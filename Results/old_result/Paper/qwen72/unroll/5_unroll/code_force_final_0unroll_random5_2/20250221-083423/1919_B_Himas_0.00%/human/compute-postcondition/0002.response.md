The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The list `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and the string `s` is composed of characters from the set {'+', '-'} and has a length equal to `n`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `test_cases`. The result for each test case is determined based on the string `s` and the integer `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` composed of '+' and '-' characters. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the contents of the string `s` and the integer `n`.**
