Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18.

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = int(m / a) + 1
    B = int(m / b) + 1
    print(A + B)
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an integer input and `int` converts it to an integer.
2. A loop runs `t` times.
3. Inside the loop, `a`, `b`, and `m` are assigned the values of `int(input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts a line of input and splits it into three integers.
4. `A` is calculated as `int(m / a) + 1`.
5. `B` is calculated as `int(m / b) + 1`.
6. The sum of `A` and `B` is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The value of `A` is `int(m / a) + 1` and the value of `B` is `int(m / b) + 1`. The sum of `A` and `B` is printed for each test case.**
