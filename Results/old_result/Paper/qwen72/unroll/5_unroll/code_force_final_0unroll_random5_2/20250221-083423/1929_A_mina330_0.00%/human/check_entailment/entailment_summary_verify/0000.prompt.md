You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a` and calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted list `a`, for each pair of elements from the start and end of the list, moving towards the center. This sum is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in the program only considers the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, but it does not account for the correct arrangement that maximizes the beauty of the array.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be 4, which can be achieved by arranging the array as [1, 4, 2, 3] or [4, 1, 3, 2]. The beauty is calculated as:
- (4 - 1) + (2 - 4) + (3 - 2) = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2
- (1 - 4) + (3 - 1) + (2 - 3) = -3 + 2 - 1 = -2
- (4 - 1) + (3 - 4) + (2 - 3) = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1
- (1 - 4) + (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = -3 + 1 + 1 = -1

However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, but this does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To correctly maximize the beauty, the array should be rearranged such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. One way to achieve this is to alternate between the largest and smallest elements, which would give the correct output for the given example.
