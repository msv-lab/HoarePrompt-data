Output State: **obj is a list of two integers representing the coordinates of an entity on the field, where the second integer (y-coordinate) is decreased by 1, and d is a string representing the direction 'L'. The coordinates in obj must be within the bounds of the field defined by N and M, and the move should not result in the entity moving outside these bounds. The direction d is not 'U', and the direction d is not 'D'.**
