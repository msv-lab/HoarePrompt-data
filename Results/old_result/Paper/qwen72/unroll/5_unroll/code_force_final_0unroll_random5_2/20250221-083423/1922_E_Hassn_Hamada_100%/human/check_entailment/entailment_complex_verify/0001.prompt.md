You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It appends a series of integers to `sequence` and then recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0). The final state of the program is that `sequence` will have additional integers appended to it, and `number` will be reduced by a specific value based on the largest power of 2 that fits within the original `number`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should be such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence that will have exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It starts by checking if `number` is 0, in which case it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `i` from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the size and value of a potential subsequence.
   - It checks if the value of the subsequence is less than or equal to `number` and if so, it updates `size_overlap`.
   - It then appends the calculated sequence of numbers to `sequence`.
   - Finally, it recursively calls `func_1` with the remaining number of increasing subsequences to be generated.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary representation approach to generate the sequence.
   - The expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by appending a sequence of length `size - i` starting from `i`.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the required `number`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The program ensures that the sequence is built correctly and does not exceed the length of 200.
   - The program uses bitwise operations to efficiently calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated, the program should print `-1`, but it does not explicitly handle this case. However, the function `func_1` is designed to always find a valid sequence for the given range of \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct in its approach to generating the required sequence. It uses a binary representation and bitwise operations to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input \( X \). The function `func_1` is designed to handle the generation of the sequence efficiently and within the constraints.
