The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. This means `t` is already in a valid range, but we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

State: **The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**
