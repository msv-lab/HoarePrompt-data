It seems there is a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description suggests a function that takes two arrays and the number of problems as input, while the function definition only includes one array. Let's correct the function definition to match the problem description:

```python
def min_new_problems(a, b):
```

Precondition: **a and b are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and both a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order. Each element in a and b satisfies 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.**
