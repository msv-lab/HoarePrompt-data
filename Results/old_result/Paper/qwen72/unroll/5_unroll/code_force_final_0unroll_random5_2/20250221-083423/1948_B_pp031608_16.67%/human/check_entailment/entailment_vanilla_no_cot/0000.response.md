Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem for several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Transformation Logic**: The program attempts to transform the array by checking if the previous element is greater than the current element and if the previous element is greater than 10. It then splits the previous element into its digits and inserts them. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks and modifies the previous element, which may not be the optimal way to achieve a sorted array. The correct approach should consider all elements that are greater than or equal to 10 and split them until the array is sorted or it is determined that it cannot be sorted.

2. **Single Pass Transformation**: The program only makes a single pass through the array and attempts to split elements. This is insufficient because multiple passes might be necessary to fully transform the array into a sorted state. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The first pass might split `12` into `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but it would not split `45` or `67` in the same pass.

3. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is sorted. However, it is called before and after the transformation logic, which is not necessary. The function should be called only once after all possible transformations are made to determine if the array is sorted.

4. **Inefficient and Incomplete Transformation**: The program does not handle cases where multiple elements need to be split in different positions. For example, in the array `[12, 28, 5]`, the program might not correctly split `28` and `12` to achieve a sorted array.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Split all elements that are greater than or equal to 10 until no more elements can be split.
- Check if the array is sorted after all possible transformations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    while True:
        changed = False
        new_a = []
        for x in a:
            if x >= 10:
                new_a.extend([int(d) for d in str(x)])
                changed = True
            else:
                new_a.append(x)
        a = new_a
        if not changed:
            break
    return a == sorted(a)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`can_be_sorted` Function**: This function repeatedly splits any element that is greater than or equal to 10 until no more elements can be split. It then checks if the resulting array is sorted.
- **Main Loop**: For each test case, the program reads the input, calls the `can_be_sorted` function, and prints the result.

This approach ensures that all possible transformations are made and the array is checked for sorting after all transformations.
