You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `f`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of integers. It determines if there are at least `k` elements in `a` that are greater than the element at index `f-1` (the favorite value). If there are, it prints 'YES'. If there are fewer than `k` elements greater than the favorite value and the sum of these elements and those equal to the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t` and `test_cases` (if they exist) are not modified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes, and the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value is less than `k`, but the total number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is greater than or equal to `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 3
4 3 3 3 3
```
- Here, `n = 5`, `f = 2`, and `k = 3`.
- The values of the cubes are `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The favorite cube's value is `3`.

The program will output:
```
MAYBE
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
YES
```
This is because after sorting the cubes in non-increasing order, the array will be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The first three cubes (which are the cubes with values `4` and `3`) will be removed, and the favorite cube (which is one of the cubes with value `3`) will definitely be among the first three cubes removed. Therefore, the favorite cube will always be removed, and the output should be "YES".

The program incorrectly concludes "MAYBE" because it does not account for the fact that if the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube's value is less than `k`, and the total number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is greater than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will always be removed.
