### Reasoning:

The provided program is a set of functions that handle input in different ways, but it does not actually implement the solution to the problem described. The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that a binary search can find the target element \( x \). The program does not contain any logic for performing the swaps or the binary search. Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem as specified.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read input in various formats. However, they do not provide any context or usage within the problem-solving logic.
2. **Missing Logic**: The program lacks the necessary logic to:
   - Find the position of \( x \) in the permutation.
   - Determine the positions to swap to make the permutation suitable for binary search.
   - Perform the binary search.
3. **Output**: The program does not produce any output, which is required to indicate the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped.

To be correct, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the permutation and the target \( x \).
- Determine and perform the necessary swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search.
- Perform the binary search and ensure that \( p_l \) is equal to \( x \).
- Output the number of swaps and the indices of the elements swapped.

Since the provided program does not include any of these steps, it is incorrect.
