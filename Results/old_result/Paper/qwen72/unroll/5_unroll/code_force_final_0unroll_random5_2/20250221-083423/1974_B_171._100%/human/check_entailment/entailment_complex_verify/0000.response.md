### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases.
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length `n` and the encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
     - The program constructs a list `unique_chars` of unique characters from the encoded string `b` and sorts them in alphabetical order. This correctly forms the auxiliary string `r` as described in the problem.
   - **Character Mapping:**
     - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in the sorted list. This is done by iterating over the list and mapping `unique_chars[i]` to `unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]`.
   - **Decoding:**
     - The program then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding value in `char_map`. This is achieved using a generator expression inside `''.join()`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program collects the results of decoding for each test case and prints them one by one. This matches the required output format.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Character Strings:**
     - If the encoded string `b` consists of a single character, the program will correctly map it to itself because the `unique_chars` list will have only one character, and `char_map` will map that character to itself.
   - **Strings with All Unique Characters:**
     - If the encoded string `b` has all unique characters, the program will correctly map each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.
   - **Strings with Repeated Characters:**
     - If the encoded string `b` has repeated characters, the program will correctly map each occurrence of a character to its symmetric character in the sorted list.

5. **Complexity:**
   - The program efficiently handles the input constraints. The time complexity for sorting the unique characters is \(O(k \log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique characters in the string. The decoding process is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. Given the constraints, this is efficient enough.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases as expected. It processes multiple test cases and outputs the correct decoded strings.

Final: **True**
