You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k` from the input. If `k` is 1, it will print `n` repetitions of the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. If `k` is greater than 1, it will print `2 - (n == 1)` repetitions of the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet. The values of `n` and `k` will be updated with each iteration, and the variable `s` will be reset to an empty string at the beginning of each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The goal is to find the shortest possible string `s` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The program constructs a string `s` by iterating over the ASCII values from 97 to `k + 97` and converting them to characters. This results in a string containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets in order.
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `n * s`, which is the string `s` repeated `n` times. This is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using one character is `s` repeated `n` times.
   - If `k > 1`, the program prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This means:
     - If `n == 1`, it prints `s` once.
     - If `n > 1`, it prints `s` twice.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - The program prints `s` repeated `n` times, which is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using one character is `s` repeated `n` times.
   - **Case 2: `k > 1`**
     - The program prints `s` twice if `n > 1`. This is not correct because it does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of `s`.
     - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the possible strings are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The string `s = "ab"` repeated twice is `"abab"`, which does not contain `aa` or `bb` as subsequences.
     - The correct approach would be to generate a string that includes all possible combinations of the first `k` characters in a way that ensures all subsequences of length `n` are present.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `k > 1` and `n > 1`. It fails to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters are subsequences of the generated string `s`.
