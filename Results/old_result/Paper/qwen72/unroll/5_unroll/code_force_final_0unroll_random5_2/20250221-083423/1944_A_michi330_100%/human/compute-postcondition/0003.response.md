The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `k` is an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return values are not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints, we can infer that the function likely returns a result that is dependent on the values of `n` and `k` within the specified ranges.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and n * (n - 1) / 2. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return values are not detailed.**
