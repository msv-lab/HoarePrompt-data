Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of integers, a list `b` of integers, and three integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer present in both the subarray and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` or `b`. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the only output is the integer `good_subarrays` representing the number of such subarrays. **
