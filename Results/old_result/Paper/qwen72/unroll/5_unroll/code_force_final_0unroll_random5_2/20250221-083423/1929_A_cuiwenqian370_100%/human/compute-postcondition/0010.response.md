The function `func_2` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `array`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `array` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 500), `n` (an integer between 2 and 100), and `array` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not specified.**
