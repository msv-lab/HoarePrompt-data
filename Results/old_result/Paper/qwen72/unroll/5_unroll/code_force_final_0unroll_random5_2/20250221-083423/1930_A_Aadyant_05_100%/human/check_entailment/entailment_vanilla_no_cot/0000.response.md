Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect due to a few issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `n` and then proceeds to read the integer `n` for each test case. However, it reads the integer `n` as a string and then converts it to an integer, which is unnecessary. It should directly read the integer `n`.

2. **List Initialization**: The program initializes `list1` and `list2` inside the loop, which is correct. However, it could be more efficient to use a single list for the integers.

3. **Sorting and Summing**: The program sorts the list of integers and then sums every second element starting from the first. This approach is incorrect because it does not always yield the maximum score. The correct approach is to sort the list and then sum the first `n` elements (since the first `n` elements will be the smallest in each pair).

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the final scores for each test case, but the logic for calculating the score is flawed.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    final = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())  # Number of pairs
        list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read and convert the integers
        list1.sort()  # Sort the list
        s = sum(list1[:n])  # Sum the first n elements
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of pairs `n` correctly.
- **List Initialization and Conversion**: The integers are read and converted to a list of integers in one step using `map`.
- **Sorting and Summing**: The list is sorted, and the sum of the first `n` elements is calculated, which ensures the maximum score.
- **Output**: The program correctly prints the final scores for each test case.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
