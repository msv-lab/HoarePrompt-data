Correctness: **False**

**Reasons:**

1. **Movement Function**: The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of players, but the movement directions are incorrectly mapped. The movements should be:
   - 'L': (-1, 0) (move left, decrease x)
   - 'R': (1, 0) (move right, increase x)
   - 'U': (0, -1) (move up, decrease y)
   - 'D': (0, 1) (move down, increase y)

2. **Handling the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the Quaffle correctly. When a player catches the Quaffle, the program should update the state to reflect that the player is now carrying the Quaffle. Similarly, when a player throws the Quaffle, the program should place the Quaffle back in the middle of the field and update the state accordingly.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is incomplete. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring and should correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.

4. **Quaffle Position**: The program does not keep track of the Quaffle's position. This is crucial for determining when a player can catch the Quaffle and for placing it back in the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Initial Quaffle Position**: The initial position of the Quaffle is not stored in the `players` dictionary, which means the program cannot determine who is carrying the Quaffle or where it should be placed after a goal.

6. **Final Score Output**: The final score output is correct, but the program should also handle the case where the Quaffle is in the middle of the field after a goal.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
quaffle_position = None
middle_position = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)

for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quaffle_position = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)

moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    entity = mo[0]
    action = mo[1]
    
    if action in 'ULDR':
        (x, y) = players[entity]
        (dx, dy) = mouvements[action]
        players[entity] = (x + dx, y + dy)
        if entity == quaffle_position:
            quaffle_position = (x + dx, y + dy)
    elif action == 'C':
        ball = mo[2]
        if ball == '.Q' and players[entity] == quaffle_position:
            quaffle_position = entity
    elif action == 'T':
        if quaffle_position == entity:
            (x, y) = players[entity]
            if (x, y) in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
            elif (x, y) in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
            quaffle_position = middle_position

print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned and should correctly simulate the game according to the problem description.
