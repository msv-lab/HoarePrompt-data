### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the exchange number `k`.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, the program correctly prints `n` because no operations can be performed. This is a valid edge case and is handled correctly.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to create a frequency table of the card numbers, capping the frequency at `k`. This is a good approach to avoid unnecessary counting beyond `k`.

4. **Output Logic:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` in the `frequency_table`.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1`. This is based on the idea that if you have exactly `k` cards of the same number, you can exchange them for `k - 1` cards, and the minimum number of cards left would be `k - 1`.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, it prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards further.

### Issues:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where multiple exchanges can be performed to reduce the number of cards. For example, in the fourth test case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the program should be able to perform multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards to 3, but it will print 10 because it does not check for this possibility.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach would be to calculate the minimum number of cards left after performing all possible exchanges. This can be done by:
  - Counting the frequency of each card number.
  - For each card number with a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, calculate the number of cards left after performing the maximum number of exchanges.
  - The minimum number of cards left is the sum of the remaining cards after all possible exchanges.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of performing multiple exchanges to reduce the number of cards further. It only checks for the presence of a single card number with a frequency exactly equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` in that case, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.
