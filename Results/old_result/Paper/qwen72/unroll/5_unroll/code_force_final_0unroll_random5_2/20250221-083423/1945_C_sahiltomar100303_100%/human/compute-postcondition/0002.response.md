Output State: **The loop will have processed all test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed a single integer indicating the optimal position of the dividing line between the left and right sides of the street to satisfy the residents' preferences as much as possible. The variables `tleftZero`, `tleftOne`, `trightZero`, and `trightOne` will have been updated to reflect the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the street for the last test case processed. The variables `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` will have been reset for each test case, and their final values will be the result of the last test case's computations.**
