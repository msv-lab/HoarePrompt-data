The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on some predefined or externally provided data that includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data.

Functionality: **The function operates on predefined data including an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a result based on these inputs, ensuring the constraints are met.**
