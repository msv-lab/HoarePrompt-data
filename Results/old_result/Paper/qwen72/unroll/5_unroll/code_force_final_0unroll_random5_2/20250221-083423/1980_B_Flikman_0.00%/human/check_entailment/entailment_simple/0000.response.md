### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input, and then reads the list `a` of cube values.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube by accessing `a[f - 1]`. This is because the index `f` is 1-based, while Python lists are 0-based.

3. **Counting Same and Greater Values:**
   - The program counts the number of cubes that have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).
   - It also counts the number of cubes that have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).

4. **Determining the Output:**
   - The program then uses these counts to determine the output:
     - If the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`) is greater than or equal to `k`, it prints 'YES'. This is because the favorite cube will always be among the first `k` cubes to be removed.
     - If the sum of the number of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value (`greater_count + same_value_count`) is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. This is because the favorite cube will never be among the first `k` cubes to be removed.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. This is because the favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes to be removed or not, depending on the order of cubes with the same value.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.
- The logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or may be removed is correct based on the problem description.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
