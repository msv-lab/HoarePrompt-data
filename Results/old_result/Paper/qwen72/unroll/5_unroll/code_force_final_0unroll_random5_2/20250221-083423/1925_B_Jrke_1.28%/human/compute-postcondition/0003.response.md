Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input. The function then calculates the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // n`. If `x // n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the maximum divisor found. The function does not return any values, but it prints the result for each test case. The values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are not modified by the function. **
