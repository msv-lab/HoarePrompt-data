### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - The array should be such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence that will have exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It starts by checking if `number` is 0, in which case it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - It then iterates over possible values of `i` from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
   - For each `i`, it calculates the size and value of a potential subsequence.
   - It checks if the value of the subsequence is less than or equal to `number` and if so, it updates `size_overlap`.
   - It then appends the calculated sequence of numbers to `sequence`.
   - Finally, it recursively calls `func_1` with the remaining number of increasing subsequences to be generated.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a binary representation approach to generate the sequence.
   - The expression `(1 << size) - (1 << i)` is used to calculate the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated by appending a sequence of length `size - i` starting from `i`.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is built in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches the required `number`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `number` is 0 by returning immediately.
   - The program ensures that the sequence is built correctly and does not exceed the length of 200.
   - The program uses bitwise operations to efficiently calculate the number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence cannot be generated, the program should print `-1`, but it does not explicitly handle this case. However, the function `func_1` is designed to always find a valid sequence for the given range of \( X \).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct in its approach to generating the required sequence. It uses a binary representation and bitwise operations to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input \( X \). The function `func_1` is designed to handle the generation of the sequence efficiently and within the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
