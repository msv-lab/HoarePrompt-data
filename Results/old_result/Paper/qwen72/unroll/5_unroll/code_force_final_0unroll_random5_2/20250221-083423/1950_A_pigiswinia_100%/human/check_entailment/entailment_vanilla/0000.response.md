Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is also correct.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which is correct as the problem specifies that each test case contains three digits.
4. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct based on the problem description.
   - It checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct based on the problem description.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE", which is the correct behavior as per the problem description.
5. **Output**: The program prints "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles the input and output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
