Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the grid for each test case. It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in a list `a`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks for specific edge cases where it is impossible to make all squares the same color:
   - If the first row and the last row are both entirely one color but different from each other, it prints "NO".
   - If the first column and the last column are both entirely one color but different from each other, it prints "NO".

3. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This is because if there are no such edge cases, it is always possible to make all squares the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles and performing the operations.

The logic is sound and covers all the necessary conditions to determine if the grid can be made uniform in color. Therefore, the program is correct.
