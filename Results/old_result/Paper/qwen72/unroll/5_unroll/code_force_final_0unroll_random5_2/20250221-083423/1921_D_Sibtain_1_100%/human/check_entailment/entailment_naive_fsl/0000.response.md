Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array `c` has duplicate values correctly. Specifically, the logic for selecting the maximum difference for each element in `a` is flawed. The program assumes that the largest and smallest elements in `c` will always provide the maximum difference, but this is not necessarily true when `c` contains duplicate values.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
3 3
1 2 3
3 3 3
```
The expected output is `6` because the maximum difference can be achieved by creating the array `c = [3, 3, 3]` and calculating the difference as:
```
D = |1-3| + |2-3| + |3-3| = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3
```
However, the program will output `9` because it incorrectly pairs the elements in `a` with the largest and smallest elements in `c` without considering the duplicates.

To fix this, the program should correctly handle the selection of elements from `c` to maximize the difference, especially when `c` contains duplicates.
