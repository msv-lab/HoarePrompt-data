You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` with a length not exceeding 500,000. It returns a new string `ans` that contains the same characters as `s`, but rearranged such that the characters are ordered based on the cumulative difference between the number of "(" and ")" characters up to each index in `s`. The characters are first sorted by the increasing difference, and for characters with the same difference, they are sorted by their index in descending order. The length of `ans` is the same as the length of `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result and a dictionary `d` to keep track of the prefix balances.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The balance is stored at the key `i + 1` in the dictionary `d`, where `i` is the current index in the string.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the string (which is `n` in length) is not needed for the shuffle operation.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values (`x[1]`), and in case of ties, by the position in decreasing order (`-x[0]`).

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted items of the dictionary `d` and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary.
   - Finally, the result string `ans` is returned.

### Analysis:

- **Balance Calculation**:
  - The balance calculation is correct. It correctly computes the balance of each prefix of the string.
  - The balance is stored at `i + 1` to align with the position in the string, which is a valid approach.

- **Dictionary Manipulation**:
  - The removal of the last entry from the dictionary is necessary because the balance at the end of the string is always 0 (since the string is balanced), and it is not needed for the shuffle operation.
  - The sorting of the dictionary items is correct. It sorts by balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order for ties, which matches the problem description.

- **Result Construction**:
  - The construction of the result string `ans` is correct. It appends characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions, which ensures that the characters are placed in the correct order for the balanced shuffle.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It handles the input, calculates the balances, sorts the positions, and constructs the result string accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
