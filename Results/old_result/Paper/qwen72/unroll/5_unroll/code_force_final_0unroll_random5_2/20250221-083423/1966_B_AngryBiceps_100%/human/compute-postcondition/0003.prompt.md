You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the dimensions and the grid, and checks the conditions for the first and last rows and columns. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop prints 'NO' if the conditions are not met, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `m` representing the dimensions of a grid, followed by `n` lines of `m` characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The function processes these test cases and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
