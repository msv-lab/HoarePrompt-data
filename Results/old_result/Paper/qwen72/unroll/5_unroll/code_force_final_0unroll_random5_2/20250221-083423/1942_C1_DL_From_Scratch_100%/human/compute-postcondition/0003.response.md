The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, where:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- `y` is an integer and y = 0.
- The function also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters and the list of vertices. However, the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and the list of vertices and return a value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, `y` is an integer and is always 0, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a value based on these inputs.**
