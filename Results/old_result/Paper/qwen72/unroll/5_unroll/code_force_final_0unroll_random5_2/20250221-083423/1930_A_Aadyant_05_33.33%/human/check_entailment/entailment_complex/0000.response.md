### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`num`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs (`a`), and the list of integers (`b`).

2. **Sorting and Selection:**
   - The function sorts the list of integers (`list1`).
   - It then selects the first `n` elements from the sorted list and appends them to `list2`. This is done by iterating over the first `n` elements of the sorted list, which are the smallest `n` elements.

3. **Summing and Storing Results:**
   - The function sums the elements in `list2` and appends the result to the `out` list.
   - This sum represents the maximum score that can be achieved by always choosing the smallest available number in each move, which is the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function prints the results stored in `out`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly. For example, if all numbers are the same, it will still correctly sum the first `n` elements.
   - The function also handles the case where `n` is 1, as shown in the first test case.

6. **Variable Management:**
   - The function correctly clears the lists `list1` and `list2` after each test case to ensure that the next test case starts with fresh lists.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score by always choosing the smallest available number in each move. The sorting and selection process ensures that the minimum values are chosen optimally. The input and output handling are also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
