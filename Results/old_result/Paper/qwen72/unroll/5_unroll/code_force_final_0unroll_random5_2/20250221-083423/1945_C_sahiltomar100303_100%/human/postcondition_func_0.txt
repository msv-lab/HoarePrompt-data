The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` containing only '0's and '1's. The function calculates and prints the optimal position of a dividing line between the left and right sides of the street to maximize the number of residents whose preferences are satisfied. The preferences are indicated by '0' for the left side and '1' for the right side. After processing all test cases, the function will have printed an integer for each test case, representing the optimal position of the dividing line. The internal variables used for calculations will be reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables will reflect the computations of the last test case processed.
