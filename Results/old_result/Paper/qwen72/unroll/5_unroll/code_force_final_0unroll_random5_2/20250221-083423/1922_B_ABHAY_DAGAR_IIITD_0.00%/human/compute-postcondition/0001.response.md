The loop head contains the variable `_` and the object `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be an iterable, and in this case, it should be a list. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the length of `test_cases`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing two elements: the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks.
- The length of the list `test_cases` is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must have at least one test case. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `test_cases` has at least one element.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
