Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `a` and a list `b` of `a` integers. For each test case, the function modifies the list `b` such that each element from the first to the third last is set to 0, and the last two elements are checked. If both the last two elements are 0, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
