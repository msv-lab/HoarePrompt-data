#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[0] = 0` and `d[n] = 0` (since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, the final depth must return to 0); for each `i` in the range `1` to `n`, `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at position `i` in the string `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a string containing characters from `s` at positions specified in `d`, in the order of their corresponding depths.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which contains characters from `s` at positions specified in `d`, in the order of their corresponding depths.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty, balanced parentheses string `s` and returns a new string `ans` that contains the characters from `s` reordered based on their depth in the parentheses structure. Specifically, `ans` will contain the characters from `s` such that characters at the same depth are grouped together and appear in the order of their depths from the shallowest to the deepest. The final state of the program is that `ans` is a string representing the characters from `s` reordered by their depth.
