#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse position in the list.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse position in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in a dictionary `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `encoded` to its reverse position in the sorted list of unique characters.
