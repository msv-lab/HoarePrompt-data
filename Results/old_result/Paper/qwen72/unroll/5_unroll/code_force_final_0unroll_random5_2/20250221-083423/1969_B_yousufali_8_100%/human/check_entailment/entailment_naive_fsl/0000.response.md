Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the scenario where the string is already sorted, which should result in a cost of 0. Additionally, the logic for calculating the cost is flawed. For example, consider the input string "101011":

- The correct output should be 5, as you can perform the following operations:
  1. Choose the substring [2, 3]: "101011" → "110011" (cost = 2)
  2. Choose the substring [3, 5]: "110011" → "111001" (cost = 3)
  3. Choose the substring [4, 6]: "111001" → "111100" (cost = 3)

However, the program will output 7, which is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
