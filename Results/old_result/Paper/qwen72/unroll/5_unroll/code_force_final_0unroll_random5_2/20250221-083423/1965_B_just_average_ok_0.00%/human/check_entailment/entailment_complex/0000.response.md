### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\). This list contains 24 elements, which is within the allowed size of 25.

2. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program finds the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\). This is done by incrementing `idx` until \(2^{\text{idx}} > k\), and then decrementing `idx` by 1. This ensures that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The program then appends three elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sum of this element and \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is `k`, but since \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed, `k` cannot be formed.
     - `k + 1`: This is a value greater than `k` and can be used to form sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is another value greater than `k` and can be used to form sums greater than `k`.
   - The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from `nums` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed as a subsequence sum.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list and the elements of the list.

5. **Verification**:
   - The modified `nums` list ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed, and the added elements are chosen to avoid forming `k`.
   - The list also ensures that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed as subsequences. This is because the list initially contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\) (which is much larger than the maximum `n` of \(10^6\)). Removing one power of 2 and adding the specified elements does not affect the ability to form all other sums.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `nums` that meets the problem's requirements for each test case. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed as subsequences.

### Correctness:
**True**
