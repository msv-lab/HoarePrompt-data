You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if total % n != 0:
        return 'NO'
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. It checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean of the list, calculated as the sum of the integers divided by the length of the list, ever becomes negative. If at any point the cumulative deviation is negative, the function returns 'NO'. If the cumulative deviation never becomes negative, the function returns 'YES'. The list `nums` remains unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by the number of containers, but the amounts cannot be equalized by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that if the cumulative difference between the current amount and the mean is non-negative at any point, the water can be equalized. However, this is not always true.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4
1 2 3 6
```

The mean amount of water is `(1 + 2 + 3 + 6) // 4 = 3`. The program will calculate the cumulative difference as follows:
- For `i = 0`: `curr += 1 - 3 = -2` (returns 'NO' immediately)

However, it is possible to equalize the water in this case by performing the following operations:
- Pour 2 units from the 4th container to the 1st container: `[3, 2, 3, 4]`
- Pour 1 unit from the 4th container to the 2nd container: `[3, 3, 3, 3]`

Thus, the correct output should be 'YES', but the program outputs 'NO'. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
