#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with a specific input format, but the function definition provided does not include parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the integer `X` for each test case, where `1 <= t <= 1000` and `2 <= X <= 10^18`. The function should handle these inputs to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly X increasing subsequences, or return -1 if no such array exists.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = []
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        ans.reverse()
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the value of `X` for each case, and generates an array `ans` that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or returns -1 if no such array exists. After processing all test cases, the loop finishes, and the final state of the variables `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `t` will be as follows: `i` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1, `x` will be 1 (since the loop ensures `x` is reduced to 1), `max` will be the initial value minus the number of even operations performed, `min` will be the initial value plus the number of odd operations performed, `ans` will contain the generated array for the last test case, and `t` will be the number of operations performed to generate the array for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads an integer `X`. It then generates an array of integers `ans` of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. If such an array can be generated, it prints the length of the array `t` and the array itself. If no such array can be generated, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the final state of the program includes the processed test cases and the generated arrays or `-1` for each test case.
