### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
   - We can perform at most 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
   - We need to ensure that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`.

2. **Binary Search in a Permutation:**
   - Binary search works efficiently on sorted arrays. However, in this problem, we are dealing with a permutation, which is not necessarily sorted.
   - The goal is to rearrange the permutation such that the binary search algorithm can find `x` correctly.

3. **Binary Search Algorithm:**
   - The provided binary search algorithm initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1`.
   - It then repeatedly calculates the midpoint `m` and updates `l` or `r` based on the comparison of `p_m` with `x`.
   - The loop terminates when `r - l = 1`.

4. **Swapping Elements:**
   - We need to determine if we can perform at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
   - The key is to ensure that the element `x` is placed in a position where the binary search algorithm will find it.

5. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program defines several functions to read input, but it does not provide the actual logic to solve the problem.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are used to read different types of input, but the main logic for solving the problem is missing.

6. **Missing Logic:**
   - The program does not include the logic to perform the swaps.
   - It does not include the logic to run the binary search.
   - It does not include the logic to output the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incomplete and does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
