The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, both integers within the range 1 to 100, and handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100. For each test case, the function returns a specific output based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
