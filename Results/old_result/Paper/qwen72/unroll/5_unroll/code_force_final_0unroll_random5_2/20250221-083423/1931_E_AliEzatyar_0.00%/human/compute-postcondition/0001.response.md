The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `num`. The loop will execute if the range defined by `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)` contains at least one value. This range starts from `len(num) - 1` and decrements by 1 until it reaches -1 (exclusive). For the loop to execute, `len(num) - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `len(num)` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` has at least one element, and `i` should be set to `len(num) - 1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`**
