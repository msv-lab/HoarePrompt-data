Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the closest city is not unique for every city, which is a constraint mentioned in the problem description. However, the main issue is that the program's logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel between two cities is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the cost of moving from one city to another by always moving in a single direction (either forward or backward) and then comparing the costs of these two paths. This approach does not consider the optimal path, which might involve moving to the closest city multiple times and then directly to the target city.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The program will output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

The program's logic for calculating the cost is correct for the given example, but it fails to handle cases where the optimal path involves moving to the closest city multiple times and then directly to the target city. For instance, if the cities are located at [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and the query is (1, 5), the program will not correctly calculate the minimum cost.

A more robust approach would be to use dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to find the minimum cost for each query, considering all possible paths and the cost of moving to the closest city.
