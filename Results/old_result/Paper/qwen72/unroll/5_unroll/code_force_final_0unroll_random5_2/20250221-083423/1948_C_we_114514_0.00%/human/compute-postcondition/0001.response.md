To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `test_case` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute as long as `test_cases` is not empty. Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one test case for the loop to execute.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **Loop Head**:
   - The loop iterates over `test_cases` using `test_case`.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute if `test_cases` is not empty.
   - Each `test_case` in `test_cases` must be a valid tuple as described in the initial state.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Ensure `test_cases` is not empty. This can be done by ensuring `t` is at least 1, and `test_cases` contains at least one valid test case.
   - `test_case` should be the first tuple in `test_cases`.

Given these conditions, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one valid test case, `test_case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
