You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. The new string `s` is formed by mapping each unique character in `b` to a corresponding lowercase Latin letter, where the characters are sorted in ascending order and mapped to letters starting from the end of the alphabet. The original string `b` and the `char_map` dictionary used for the mapping remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process:**
   - The string `s` is encoded by first constructing a new string `r` that consists of all distinct characters of `s` in alphabetical order.
   - Each character in `s` is then replaced by its symmetric character in `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", then 'a' is replaced by 'c', 'b' is replaced by 'b', and 'c' is replaced by 'a'.

2. **Decoding Process:**
   - To decode the string `b`, we need to reverse the encoding process.
   - We first need to construct the string `r` from the distinct characters in `b` in alphabetical order.
   - Then, we create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num_test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `num_chars` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(b)` to decode the string `b`.

4. **Function `func_1(b)`:**
   - The function constructs a set of distinct characters from `b` and sorts them to form the string `r`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - It then constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

5. **Error in the Program:**
   - The program incorrectly maps each character in `r` to a character in the range from 'a' to 'z' based on the length of `b`, rather than the length of `r`.
   - This is a mistake because the symmetric replacement should be based on the length of `r`, not `b`.

6. **Corrected Mapping:**
   - The correct mapping should be from each character in `r` to its symmetric character in `r`.
   - For example, if `r` is "cdefors", the mapping should be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'o'
     - 'f' -> 'o'
     - 'o' -> 'e'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'

7. **Corrected Program:**
   - The corrected program should use `len(r)` instead of `len(b)` when creating the symmetric mapping.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it uses the length of the encoded string `b` to create the symmetric mapping, which is not the correct approach. The symmetric mapping should be based on the length of the distinct characters in `b` (i.e., the length of `r`).
