Output State: **`main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. `sub_summ` is 0.** 

The initial state specifies that `main_ar` and `sec_arr` are lists of tuples containing integers, and the code snippet initializes `sub_summ` to 0. No other variables are affected, and the values of `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged.
