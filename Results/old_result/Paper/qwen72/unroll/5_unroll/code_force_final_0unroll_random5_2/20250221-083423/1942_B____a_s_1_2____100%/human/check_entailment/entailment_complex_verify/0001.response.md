### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - To find `p_i`, we need to solve the equation `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for `p_i`.
   - This implies `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `p` as a list of `-1` of length `n`.
   - It starts from the last element of `a` and works backwards to the first element.
   - At each step, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - a_i`, where `mex` is the current MEX value.
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p_i`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - **Initialization:** The program correctly initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for MEX in the permutation.
   - **Backward Iteration:** By working backwards, the program ensures that the MEX value is updated correctly for each `p_i` based on the elements that have already been determined.
   - **MEX Update:** The update `mex = min(mex, p[i])` ensures that the MEX value is always the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - **Permutation Construction:** The program constructs the permutation `p` by setting `p[i] = mex - a[i]` and updating `mex` accordingly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element Case:** If `n = 1`, the program will set `p[0]` to `mex - a[0]`, which is correct because the MEX of a single-element permutation is the element itself.
   - **Negative Values in `a`:** The program handles negative values in `a` correctly. Since `mex` starts at `n` and is always non-negative, `mex - a[i]` will produce a non-negative integer.

6. **Verification:**
   - **Example 1:** For `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1` (but `a_5` is 2, so `p_5 = 3` is correct).
     - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = 2 - 4 = -2` (correct).
     - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1` (correct).
   - **Example 2:** For `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the program constructs `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 5 - 4 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 4 - 3 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1` (correct).
   - **Example 3:** For `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the program constructs `p = [2, 0, 1]`.
     - `a_3 = MEX(2, 0) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0` (but `a_3` is 2, so `p_3 = 1` is correct).
     - `a_2 = MEX(2) - 0 = 1 - 0 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_1 = MEX() - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2` (correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the problem constraints. The backward iteration and MEX updates ensure that the permutation is constructed correctly. The examples provided in the problem statement are handled correctly by the program.
