Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key insight here is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to equalize the water levels if and only if the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the average amount of water.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it:

1. Reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
3. Takes the last element of `nums` and calculates the sum of differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element.
4. If this sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the average amount of water that each container should have. The program only checks if the sum of differences from the last element is zero, which is not a valid criterion for determining whether the water can be equalized.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Calculate the average amount of water that each container should have.
2. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container ends up with this average amount.

Since the provided program does not follow this correct logic, it will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
