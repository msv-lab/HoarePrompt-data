Reasoning:  
The program follows the problem description accurately. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. It then checks the conditions for a "stair" or a "peak" and prints the appropriate result. The logic is straightforward and matches the requirements:

1. If `a < b < c`, it prints "STAIR".
2. If `a < b > c`, it prints "PEAK".
3. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, reading the inputs and printing the correct outputs based on the conditions. There are no logical errors or issues with the input/output handling.

Correctness: **True**
