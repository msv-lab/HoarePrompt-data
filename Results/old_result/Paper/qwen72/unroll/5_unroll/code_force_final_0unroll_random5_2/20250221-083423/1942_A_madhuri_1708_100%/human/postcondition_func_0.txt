The function reads multiple lines of input, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each line, it prints a list of `n` integers based on the following conditions: If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of `n` integers all equal to `k` if `n` equals `k`, otherwise it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all lines, the function concludes.
