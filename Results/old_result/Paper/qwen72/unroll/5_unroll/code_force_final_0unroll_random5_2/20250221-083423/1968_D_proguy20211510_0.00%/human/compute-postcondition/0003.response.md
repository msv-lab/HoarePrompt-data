The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input is a positive integer, and the loop counter `_` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
