Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the number of cubes, but it does not account for the fact that Nikita can only add or remove one cube at a time. For the program to be correct, it should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because if `n - m` is even, it means Nikita can achieve the desired number of cubes by alternating between adding and removing cubes.

For example, consider the test case `2 1`:
- According to the problem, Nikita can achieve a tower with 1 cube after 2 moves by adding a cube and then removing it, and then adding it again.
- However, the program will output "No" because `n` (2) is not greater than or equal to `m` (1), which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
