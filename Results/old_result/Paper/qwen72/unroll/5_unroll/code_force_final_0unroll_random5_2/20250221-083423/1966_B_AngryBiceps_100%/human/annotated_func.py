#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) representing the dimensions of the grid, followed by n lines each containing m characters 'W' or 'B' representing the initial colors of the grid. The total number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the dimensions and the grid, and checks the conditions for the first and last rows and columns. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop prints 'NO' if the conditions are not met, otherwise it prints 'YES'. The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of dimensions `n` by `m` with characters 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it reads the grid and checks specific conditions on the first and last rows and columns. If the first row or last row contains only one unique character and they are not the same, or if the first column or last column contains only one unique character and they are not the same, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
