The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` where `1 <= k <= n <= 10^9`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer value that represents the position of the k-th element in a specific sequence derived from `n` and `k`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the loop variables `s` and `m` are reset for each test case.
