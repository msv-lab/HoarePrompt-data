Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Specifically, the program does not sort the columns of the table in increasing order of prefix balance, breaking ties in decreasing order of position. Instead, it sorts the positions in increasing order of prefix balance, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input "(()(()))":

- The correct prefix balance table is:
  ```
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
  Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  ```

- The correct sorted table should be:
  ```
  Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
  ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
  Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
  Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  ```

- The program's output should be "(()(()))", but the current implementation will output "(()(()))" incorrectly.

To fix this, the program should sort the positions in increasing order of prefix balance, and for ties, in decreasing order of position. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        d[i] = balance
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

This corrected version will ensure that the balanced shuffle operation is performed correctly.
