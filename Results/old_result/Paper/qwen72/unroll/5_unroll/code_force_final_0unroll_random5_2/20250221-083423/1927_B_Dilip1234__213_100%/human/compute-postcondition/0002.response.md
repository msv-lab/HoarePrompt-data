The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state of `i` is not explicitly given, but it will be initialized by the loop to 0 on the first iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0**
