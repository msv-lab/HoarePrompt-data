The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the elements of the `results` list to the standard output, each on a new line, followed by an additional newline character.

- The `results` list, which contains `T` elements, is not modified by this code.
- The `index` variable remains equal to `2 + T * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the number of signs in the last test case.
- The `T` variable remains unchanged.

Output State: **The `results` list is printed to the standard output, each element on a new line, followed by an additional newline character. `results` contains `T` elements, `index` is equal to `2 + T * (n + 1)`, and `T` remains unchanged.**
