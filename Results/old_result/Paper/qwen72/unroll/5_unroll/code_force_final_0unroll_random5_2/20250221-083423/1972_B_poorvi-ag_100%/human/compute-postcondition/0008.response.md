Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then determines if the count of 'U' in the string `s` is odd, appending 'yes' to a results list if true, and 'no' if false. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the results list to the console, one by one. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
