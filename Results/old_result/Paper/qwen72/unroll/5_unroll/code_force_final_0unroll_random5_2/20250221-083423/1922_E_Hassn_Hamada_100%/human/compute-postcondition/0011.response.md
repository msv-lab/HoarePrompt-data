The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`, and always returns the tuple (0, 0).**
