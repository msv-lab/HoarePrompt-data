Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Order of Operations**: The program does not correctly handle the operation of breaking down numbers greater than 10. It only checks if the resulting array is sorted after a single pass through the array, which is not sufficient. The operation can be applied multiple times, and the program should continue breaking down elements until no further operations are possible.

2. **Insertion of Digits**: The program does not correctly insert the digits of a number greater than 10 in the same position. Instead, it appends the digits to the end of the array, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Handling of Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_1` is called twice for each test case, but it should be called once per test case. The results of each test case should be stored and printed after all test cases have been processed.

4. **Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The logic for checking if the array is sorted is flawed. It only checks if the array is sorted after a single pass, which is not enough to ensure the array can be sorted after multiple operations.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(a):
    # Function to split a number into its digits
    def split_number(num):
        return [int(digit) for digit in str(num)]
    
    # Process the array
    while True:
        new_a = []
        for num in a:
            if num >= 10:
                new_a.extend(split_number(num))
            else:
                new_a.append(num)
        if new_a == a:
            break
        a = new_a
    
    # Check if the array is sorted
    return a == sorted(a)

m = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(m):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(a):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version:
- Continuously splits numbers greater than 10 until no further splits are possible.
- Checks if the final array is sorted.
- Handles multiple test cases correctly by storing the results and printing them at the end.
