### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input, especially when the input is large and multiple test cases are involved.
   - The program initializes an index to keep track of the current position in the input list and reads the number of test cases `T` from the first element of the list.
   - The program then reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` for each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a` from the input list.
   - The program initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`, which is the year when the first sign occurs.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The program iterates through the list of periodicities starting from the second sign.
   - For each sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.
   - The program updates `last_year` to `next_year` for the next iteration.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program appends the final `last_year` to the results list.
   - Finally, the program writes the results to the standard output, each on a new line.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Initial `last_year` = 3
  - For `a[1]` = 2: Next year = (3 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4
  - For `a[2]` = 4: Next year = (4 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8
  - For `a[3]` = 5: Next year = (8 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10
  - For `a[4]` = 9: Next year = (10 + 1 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18
  - For `a[5]` = 18: Next year = (18 + 1 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36
  - Output: 36

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Initial `last_year` = 1
  - For `a[1]` = 2: Next year = (1 + 1 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 2
  - For `a[2]` = 3: Next year = (2 + 1 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3
  - For `a[3]` = 4: Next year = (3 + 1 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 4
  - For `a[4]` = 5: Next year = (4 + 1 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 5
  - Output: 5

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Initial `last_year` = 1
  - For `a[1]` = 1: Next year = (1 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 2
  - For `a[2]` = 1: Next year = (2 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 3
  - For `a[3]` = 1: Next year = (3 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 4
  - For `a[4]` = 1: Next year = (4 + 1 + 1 - 1) // 1 * 1 = 5
  - Output: 5

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Initial `last_year` = 50
  - For `a[1]` = 30: Next year = (50 + 1 + 30 - 1) // 30 * 30 = 60
  - For `a[2]` = 711: Next year = (60 + 1 + 711 - 1) // 711 * 711 = 711
  - For `a[3]` = 200: Next year = (711 + 1 + 200 - 1) // 200 * 200 = 800
  - For `a[4]` = 503: Next year = (800 + 1 + 503 - 1) // 503 * 503 = 1006
  - For `a[5]` = 1006: Next year = (1006 + 1 + 1006 - 1) // 1006 * 1006 = 2012
  - Output: 2012

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the n-th sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen. The formula used to calculate the next year is accurate and the program handles multiple test cases correctly.

Final: **True**
