The function `func_1` is described with a specific context where it should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. However, the provided function signature `def func_1():` does not include these parameters. Assuming the function is intended to be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, and considering the constraints provided, the function's intended functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function is designed to process a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the periodicities of the signs and `n` is the number of signs. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 1000. The function returns a result based on the periodicities and the number of signs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**

Note: The actual parameters and return value are not explicitly defined in the provided function signature, so the description is based on the context given in the parameter constraints and relationships.
