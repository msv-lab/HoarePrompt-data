Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The key to maximizing the beauty is to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. 

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Sorting the Array**: The function `func_1` sorts the array in ascending order.
- **Calculating Beauty**: It then calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
- **Absolute Differences**: Since the array is sorted, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are always non-negative, and the sum of these differences is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending or descending order.

However, the problem specifies that the beauty is the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value. This means that to maximize the beauty, we should aim to have the largest possible positive differences and the smallest possible negative differences. 

### Correct Approach:
- **Rearranging the Array**: To achieve the maximum beauty, the array should be rearranged in a way that maximizes the positive differences. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Reading Input**: The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
- **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself, then calls `func_1` to calculate the beauty.
- **Output**: It collects the results and prints them.

### Issue with `func_1`:
- **Absolute Differences**: The function `func_1` calculates the sum of absolute differences, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value.

### Conclusion:
- **Incorrect Calculation**: The use of `abs` in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) directly.
- **Correct Calculation**: The correct approach would be to sort the array and then calculate the sum of \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without taking the absolute value.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem's requirement.

Correctness: **False**
