### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus used for the final answer.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`. This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs randomly and equiprobably.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `f` for all pairs of friends and stores this sum in `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum:**
   - The program iterates over each excursion and calculates the expected increase in the sum of friendship values.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is used to calculate the expected increase in friendship values due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions. However, this term is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship values for each excursion should be the sum of the initial friendship values `a` plus the expected increase due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions.
   - The correct approach is to use the linearity of expectation. For each excursion, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values is the sum of the initial friendship values `a` plus the expected increase due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions. The expected increase due to the pairs chosen in previous excursions can be calculated as the sum of the friendship values of all pairs chosen in previous excursions, divided by the total number of possible pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that the final result is within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program should correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        
        expected_sum = 0
        for i in range(k):
            expected_sum = (expected_sum + a) % M
            a = (a + c * m * i) % M
        
        print(expected_sum)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed calculation of the expected sum.
- The corrected program accurately calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
