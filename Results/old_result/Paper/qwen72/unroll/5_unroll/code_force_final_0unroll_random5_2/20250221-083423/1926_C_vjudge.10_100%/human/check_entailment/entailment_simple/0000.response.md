Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) (200001), which is the upper limit for the largest number \(n\) plus one. This is appropriate because the list `values` needs to store the sum of digits up to \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input and initializes a list `values` of size `inf` with all elements set to 0. This list will be used to store the cumulative sum of the digits of numbers from 1 to \(i\).

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program then precomputes the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to 200000 and stores these sums in the `values` list.
   - For each integer \(i\) from 1 to 200000, it calculates the sum of the digits of \(i\) by converting \(i\) to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `sum_value_digits`.
   - It then updates `values[i]` to be the sum of `values[i-1]` and `sum_value_digits`. This ensures that `values[i]` contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \(i\).

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program reads each test case value \(n\) and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - This approach is efficient because it avoids recalculating the sum of digits for each test case, leveraging the precomputed values in the `values` list.

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \(n\), which is correctly stored in `values[n]`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \(O(2 \times 10^5 \times \log(2 \times 10^5))\) time, which is feasible within the given constraints.
   - Each test case is processed in \(O(1)\) time, which is well within the 0.5 seconds per test case limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
