### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating over `num_list` and updating the dictionary.

3. **Calculating the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - The key observation here is that for three sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
   - Given the lengths are \(2^{a_i}\), the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if at least two of the sticks have the same length (i.e., the same exponent).

4. **Combination Calculations:**
   - If a particular exponent appears at least 3 times, the number of ways to choose 3 sticks with that exponent is calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
   - If a particular exponent appears at least 2 times, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks with that exponent and 1 stick with a different exponent is calculated using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total\_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total\_count \), where `total_count` is the total number of sticks with different exponents seen so far.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are stored in the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `results` list.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The combination calculations for forming triangles are correct.
- The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue:
- The program does not account for the case where all three sticks have different lengths but still form a non-degenerate triangle. This is because the lengths are \(2^{a_i}\), and the sum of any two lengths will always be greater than the third if they are distinct. However, the problem statement and the provided test cases suggest that this case is not possible (as seen in the third test case where lengths 2, 4, and 8 do not form a triangle).

Given the constraints and the problem description, the program is correct for the given inputs and test cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
