Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the logic for inserting a new problem and then removing the most difficult problem is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
3
```

The program fails because it does not correctly manage the insertion and removal of elements to ensure that the array `a` is always sorted in non-decreasing order after each operation. Instead, it directly inserts the new difficulty at the current index `i` and then removes the last element, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, in the first test case:
- Initially, `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]` and `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`.
- The program will first insert `800` at index `0` and remove `2700`, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`.
- Next, it will insert `1200` at index `1` and remove `2200`, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 2000, 2000]`.
- Then, it will insert `1500` at index `2` and remove `2000`, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 2000]`.
- Finally, it will insert `1800` at index `3` and remove `2000`, resulting in `a = [800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1800]`.

However, the correct approach should be to insert the new difficulty in such a way that the array remains sorted and then remove the most difficult problem. The program does not handle this correctly, leading to an incorrect count of operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
