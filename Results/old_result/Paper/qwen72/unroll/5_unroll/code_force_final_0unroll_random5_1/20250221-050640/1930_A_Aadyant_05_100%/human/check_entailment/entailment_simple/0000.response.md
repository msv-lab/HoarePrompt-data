### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `a` (which is not used) and the list of integers `b` as a single string.
   - It then splits the string `b` into a list of strings `list1` and converts each string to an integer, storing them in `list2`.

2. **Sorting and Summing**:
   - The list `list2` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The function then iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element, which is at index 0) and adding it to the score `s`.
   - This approach is based on the fact that to maximize the score, you should always choose the smaller of the two numbers in each pair, and the smallest numbers will be at the even indices in the sorted list.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the function appends the score `s` to the `final` list.
   - Finally, it prints each score in the `final` list, one per line.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies that to maximize the score, you should always choose the smaller of the two numbers in each pair.
  - By sorting the list and summing the elements at even indices, the algorithm ensures that the smallest numbers are chosen first, which is the optimal strategy.

- **Input and Output**:
  - The function correctly handles the input format as described in the problem statement.
  - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
  - The output format is also correct, printing one score per test case.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as the smallest possible `n` (1) and the largest possible `n` (50).
  - It also handles cases where all numbers are the same or where the numbers are already in a sorted order.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and follows the problem description and constraints accurately. It will produce the correct output for the given input format and problem requirements.
