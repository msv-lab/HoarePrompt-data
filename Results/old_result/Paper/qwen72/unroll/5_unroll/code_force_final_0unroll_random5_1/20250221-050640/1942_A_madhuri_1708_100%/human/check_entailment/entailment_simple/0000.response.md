### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a way to read from standard input in Python. It processes each line starting from the second line, as the first line contains the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `k >= 2`:
     - If `n == k`, it prints a sequence of `k` integers, each equal to `k`. This is correct because if `n == k`, the array can be `[k, k, ..., k]` (n times), and all cyclic shifts of this array will be sorted.
     - If `n != k`, it prints `-1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of constructing an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k < n`.

3. **Handling `k < 2`**:
   - If `k < 2`, the program prints a sequence of integers from `1` to `n`. This is correct because:
     - If `k == 1`, the array can be `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - If `k == 0`, the array can be `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, and no cyclic shift will be sorted. However, the program does not handle `k == 0` correctly, as it prints a sequence from `1` to `n`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Handling of `k >= 2` and `n != k`**:
  - The program prints `-1` if `k >= 2` and `n != k`. This is incorrect because there are valid arrays that can have exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts even when `k < n`.

- **Missing Handling for `k == 0`**:
  - The program does not handle the case where `k == 0`. It should print `-1` in this case because no array can have zero sorted cyclic shifts.

### Correct Solution:
To correct the program, we need to handle the cases where `k >= 2` and `n != k` properly. We can construct an array that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts by placing the largest element at the end of the first `k` elements and ensuring the rest of the elements are in a non-decreasing order.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k == 0:
            print('-1')
        elif k == 1:
            print(*[(j + 1) for j in range(n)])
        elif k == n:
            print(*[1 for j in range(n)])
        else:
            # Construct an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
            a = [1] * (n - k + 1) + [2] * (k - 1)
            print(*a)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Case `k == 0`**:
  - Print `-1` because no array can have zero sorted cyclic shifts.
- **Case `k == 1`**:
  - Print a sequence from `1` to `n` because only the first cyclic shift will be sorted.
- **Case `k == n`**:
  - Print a sequence of `1` repeated `n` times because all cyclic shifts will be sorted.
- **Case `1 < k < n`**:
  - Construct an array with the first `n - k + 1` elements as `1` and the next `k - 1` elements as `2`. This ensures that exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted.

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned.
- The corrected program is correct and handles all cases as described in the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
