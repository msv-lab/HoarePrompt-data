Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in arr satisfies 1 <= a_i <= len(arr); `i` is 0; `n` is equal to the length of `arr`; `j` is equal to `n` - 1.** 

The variable `j` is assigned the value of the length of `arr` minus 1, which is `n` - 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
