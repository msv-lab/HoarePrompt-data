The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of tuples representing the pairs of friends and their initial friendship values. The parameters should satisfy: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the list of tuples should contain m elements, each with three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9.
