Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, following the sequential occurrence rule as described in the problem. The program reads the input as specified, processes each test case by calculating the next occurrence year for each sign, and outputs the results in the correct format. The logic for calculating the next year in which a sign occurs is sound and handles the edge cases, such as the first sign and the transition between signs, correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
