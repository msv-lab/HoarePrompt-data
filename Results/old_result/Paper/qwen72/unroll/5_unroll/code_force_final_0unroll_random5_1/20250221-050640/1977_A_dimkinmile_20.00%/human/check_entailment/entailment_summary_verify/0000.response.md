Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the target number of cubes, but it does not consider the parity (odd or even nature) of `n` and how it affects the possibility of achieving a tower with exactly `m` cubes.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If `n` is odd, then after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any odd number from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- If `n` is even, then after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any even number from 0 to `n` (inclusive).

The provided program does not account for these conditions. Instead, it simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient. For example:
- In the test case `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the program will output "No" because `2 < 4`, which is correct.
- However, in the test case `n = 2` and `m = 1`, the program will output "Yes" because `2 >= 1`, but the correct output should be "No" because it is impossible to end up with an odd number of cubes after an even number of moves.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` is odd, `m` can be any odd number from 1 to `n`.
- If `n` is even, `m` can be any even number from 0 to `n`.

Given this, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
