You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The function `func` will have processed all test cases and printed the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `sb`, `ss`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, and `maxb` will have been updated and used during the loop execution, but their final values will be irrelevant as they are reset for each test case. The loop will have completed all iterations, and the function will have finished executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it determines the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on the maximum value in `a` and the positions `P_B` and `P_S`. The function prints 'Bodya' if Bodya wins, 'Sasha' if Sasha wins, or 'Draw' if the game is a draw. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the results have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` as integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` as lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value in `a`, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It maintains two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also maintains two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has found the maximum value in `a`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - For each turn, the program updates the scores based on the current positions of Bodya and Sasha.
   - If a player has found the maximum value in `a`, their score is updated to the maximum value for the remaining turns.
   - If a player has not found the maximum value, their score is updated based on the current position and the next position in the permutation.

5. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the scores for Bodya and Sasha in `preb` and `pres`.

6. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha by adding the remaining turns' scores to the prefix sums.
   - It then compares the maximum final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Use of `MOD` and `alpha`:**
  - The variables `MOD` and `alpha` are defined but not used in the program. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

- **Incorrect Logic for Remaining Turns:**
  - The logic for updating the scores for the remaining turns is incorrect. The program assumes that once a player finds the maximum value in `a`, they will stay at that position for the remaining turns. However, the game rules allow a player to either stay or move to the next position in the permutation, and the optimal strategy is not necessarily to stay at the maximum value.

- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for the remaining turns by multiplying the maximum value in `a` by the remaining number of turns. This does not account for the possibility of moving to other positions in the permutation.

### Correctness:
- **False:**
  - The program does not correctly simulate the game according to the rules. It makes incorrect assumptions about the optimal strategy and the score calculation for the remaining turns.

### Correctness: **False**
