### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` for each test case.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and large inputs, as it minimizes the number of I/O operations.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`. This ensures that the characters are in alphabetical order and only unique characters are considered.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character in the list. This is done by iterating through the sorted list and mapping the character at index `i` to the character at index `len_unique - 1 - i`.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Symmetric Mapping:**
   - The symmetric mapping is correctly implemented. For example, if the unique characters in the encoded string are `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - This ensures that the decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem, where the first character is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the decoded string to a list `results` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the list `results`.
   - This approach ensures that the output is correctly formatted and all test cases are handled.

### Validation with Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
  - This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the input string `b` consists of lowercase Latin letters.

- **State inside the function `func_1`:**
  - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
  - `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse in the list.
  - For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
  - This mapping is correct and aligns with the problem's encoding algorithm.

- **State of the program after the function call:**
  - The program returns the string `decoded`, which is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`.
  - This ensures that the decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process, as required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and correctly maps the characters to their symmetric counterparts.

### Correctness:
**True**
