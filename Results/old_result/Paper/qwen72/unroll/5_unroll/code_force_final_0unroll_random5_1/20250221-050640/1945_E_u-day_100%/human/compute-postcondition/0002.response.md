Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The variable `pos` is explicitly set to -1, and the other variables (`n`, `k`, and `arr`) retain their values and properties as described in the initial state.
