To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `num` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is currently an input string, it needs to be converted to an integer and must be greater than 0. The variable `num` will start at 0, as is typical for a `range` loop.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `num` is 0, `final` is an empty list**
