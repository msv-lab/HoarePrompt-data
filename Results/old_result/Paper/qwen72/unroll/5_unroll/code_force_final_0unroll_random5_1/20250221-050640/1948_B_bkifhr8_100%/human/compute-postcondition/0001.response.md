The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is automatically managed by the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `n` is an input integer representing the length of the list `a`, and it must satisfy the condition 2 <= n <= 50. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since the condition 2 <= n <= 50 already ensures that `n` is greater than 1, no additional adjustment is needed for `n`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a placeholder variable**
