The only objects in the loop head are the variable `n` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one inner list, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `freq` is an empty dictionary and `arr` is a list of lists, but the state of `freq` is not relevant to the loop head. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one inner list, and `n` will be the first inner list in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of lists that must have at least one inner list, `n` is the first inner list in `arr`**
