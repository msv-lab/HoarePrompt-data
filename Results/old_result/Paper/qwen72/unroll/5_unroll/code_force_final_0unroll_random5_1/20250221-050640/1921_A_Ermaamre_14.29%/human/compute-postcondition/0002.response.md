Output State: **For each test case, the loop prints the square of the side length of the square formed by the given coordinates. The variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4` and `res` are updated in each iteration, but their final values after the loop depends on the last test case input. The variable `a` remains unchanged.**
