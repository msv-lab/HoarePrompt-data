Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine if the grid can be made uniform is flawed. The program checks only the first and last rows and the first and last columns, but this is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.

Here is a counterexample:
```
Input:
1
3 3
BWB
WBW
BWB

Output:
NO

Expected Output:
YES
```

In this example, the grid can be made uniform by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'B') and coloring the entire grid 'B'. However, the program incorrectly outputs 'NO' because it only checks the first and last rows and columns, which do not meet the criteria set in the program.
