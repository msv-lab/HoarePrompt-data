The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n`: an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
- `x`: an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5).
- `y`: an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, where y = 0.
- `vertices`: a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases should not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, where each result indicates the number of ways to choose `y` additional vertices such that the chosen vertices (including Bessie's) form a convex polygon.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `vertices`. It returns a list of results, each indicating the number of ways to choose `y` additional vertices to form a convex polygon with Bessie's chosen vertices, for each of the `t` test cases.**
