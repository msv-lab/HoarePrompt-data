Correctness: **False**

The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem:

1. The variables used in the program do not match the problem description. The problem states that the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, but the program uses `a`, `b`, and `c` for the input values.
2. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is incorrect. The program compares `a * b` with `a * d`, where `d` is `c / 2`. However, `c` is not the number of yogurts but the price for two yogurts, and `a` is the number of yogurts. The correct approach should involve comparing the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price with the cost of buying individual yogurts at the regular price.
3. The program does not handle the case where the number of yogurts is odd correctly. It should account for the cost of the remaining yogurt if `n` is odd.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts at the promotional price
        pairs_cost = (n // 2) * b
        # Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price
        single_cost = (n % 2) * a
        # The total minimum cost is the sum of the pairs cost and the single cost
        total_cost = pairs_cost + single_cost
        print(total_cost)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the input and calculates the minimum cost based on the given problem description.
