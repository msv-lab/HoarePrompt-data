The function definition provided does not match the problem description, as the problem involves processing an array and determining if it can be sorted through specific operations. The function should take the array and the number of elements as inputs. Here is the corrected function definition and precondition:

Function definition:
```
def can_sort_with_operations(n, a):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 99.**
