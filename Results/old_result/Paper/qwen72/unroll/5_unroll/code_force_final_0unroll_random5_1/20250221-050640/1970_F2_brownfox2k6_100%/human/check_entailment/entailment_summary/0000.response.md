Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes lists and dictionaries to store the positions of goals, the Bludger, players, and the Quaffle.
   - The field is read line by line, and the positions of goals, the Bludger, players, and the Quaffle are stored appropriately.

2. **Game Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of steps (T) and processes each step.
   - For each step, it reads the entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - If the action is 'C' (catch), it updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - If the action is 'T' (throw), it updates the `carry` variable to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If so, it updates the score and prints the appropriate goal message. The Quaffle is then reset to the middle of the field.
   - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it calls `func_1` to update their positions.
   - If the entity is a player, it calls `func_1` to update the player's position and `func_2` to check for eliminations.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction given.
   - It correctly modifies the coordinates in place based on the direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if any player is in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It collects the keys of eliminated players, sets their positions to `[-1, -1]`, and prints the elimination messages in alphabetical order.

5. **Final Score**:
   - After processing all steps, the program prints the final score.

**Potential Issues**:
- **Bludger Elimination**: The program correctly handles the elimination of players when they are in the same position as the Bludger.
- **Quaffle Catching and Throwing**: The program correctly updates the `carry` variable and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal to update the score and print the goal message.
- **Quaffle Reset**: The Quaffle is correctly reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
- **Player Movements**: The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the actions.

**Conclusion**:
The program appears to correctly handle all the rules and requirements of the game as described in the problem. It processes each step, updates the positions, checks for eliminations, and prints the appropriate messages and final score.

Correctness: **True**
