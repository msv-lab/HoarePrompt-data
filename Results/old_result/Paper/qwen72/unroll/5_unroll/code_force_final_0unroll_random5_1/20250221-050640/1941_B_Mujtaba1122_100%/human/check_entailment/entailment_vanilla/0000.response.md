### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Rudolf can choose an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n - 1 \)) and perform the operation:
     - \( a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1 \)
     - \( a_i = a_i - 2 \)
     - \( a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1 \)
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using these operations.

2. **Function 1:**
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function 2:**
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to apply the operations to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it performs the operation while \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed as follows:
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1] \)
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1] \)
   - If at any point \( list[i-1] \) becomes zero, it prints "no" and returns.
   - After attempting to apply the operations, it calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The operation in `func_2` is incorrect. The correct operation should be:
     - \( list[i-1] -= 1 \)
     - \( list[i] -= 2 \)
     - \( list[i+1] -= 1 \)
   - The current implementation multiplies the decrement by `list[i-1]`, which is not what the problem description specifies.
   - This incorrect operation can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints.
   - Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is not necessary and can be removed since the operation should only be performed when all three elements are positive.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should only perform the operation when \( list[i] > 1 \) and both \( list[i-1] \) and \( list[i+1] \) are greater than 0.
   - After performing the operation, it should check if the array can be made zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because the operation in `func_2` is not implemented according to the problem description, and it can lead to negative values in the array, which is not allowed. Additionally, the check `if list[i-1] != 0:` is unnecessary and can be removed.
