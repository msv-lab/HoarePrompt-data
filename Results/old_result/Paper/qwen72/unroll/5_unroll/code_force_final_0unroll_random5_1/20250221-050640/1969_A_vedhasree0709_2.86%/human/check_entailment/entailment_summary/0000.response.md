Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by checking if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+1) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2, indicating that Monocarp needs to send invitations to only 2 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If no such pair is found, it prints 3, suggesting that Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends.

However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks for a specific type of pair (i, i+1) and does not consider the general case where any two friends can be best friends of each other. The program fails to handle cases where the best friends are not in consecutive indices but still form a valid pair that can be invited together.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
2 3 4 1 5
```
Here, friends 1 and 4 are best friends of each other, and friends 2 and 3 are best friends of each other. The program will not detect this and will incorrectly print 3 instead of 2.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
