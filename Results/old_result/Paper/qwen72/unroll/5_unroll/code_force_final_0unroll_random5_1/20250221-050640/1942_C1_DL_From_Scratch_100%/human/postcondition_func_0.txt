The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case includes the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. For each test case, it calculates and prints the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices, plus the number of chosen vertices minus 2. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the variables `T`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `list0` will hold the values from the last test case processed.
