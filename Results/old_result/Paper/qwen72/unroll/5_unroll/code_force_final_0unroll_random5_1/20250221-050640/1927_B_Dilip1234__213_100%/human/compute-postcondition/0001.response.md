Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n), `s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros.** 

The variable `char_count` is now a list containing 26 elements, all initialized to 0. The initial values of `n`, `a`, and `s` remain unchanged.
