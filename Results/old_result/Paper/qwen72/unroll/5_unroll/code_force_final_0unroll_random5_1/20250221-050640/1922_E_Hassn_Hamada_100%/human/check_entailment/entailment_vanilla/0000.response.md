### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence where the elements are strictly increasing.
   - If no such array exists, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The length of the generated sequence is printed, followed by the sequence itself.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function iterates over possible values of `i` and calculates the number of increasing subsequences that can be generated with a given length and overlap.
   - It appends elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself to handle the remaining number of subsequences.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The program uses bitwise operations to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built by appending elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is controlled.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to handle the case where the number of increasing subsequences is reduced by the value of the current subsequence.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( n \) is 1 (which is not possible since \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \)).
   - The program should handle the case where \( n \) is very large and ensure the sequence length does not exceed 200.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly uses bitwise operations to calculate the number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( n \).
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

However, there is a potential issue in the program:
   - The function `func_1` is not defined to handle the case where \( n \) is 1, which is not possible according to the problem constraints. This might lead to incorrect behavior.
   - The function `func_1` should return \(-1\) if it is impossible to generate the required sequence.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \( n \) is 1, which is not possible according to the problem constraints. Additionally, the function `func_1` should return \(-1\) if it is impossible to generate the required sequence, but it does not do so. This can lead to incorrect output for some test cases.

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we need to ensure that the function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case where \( n \) is 1 and returns \(-1\) if it is impossible to generate the required sequence.

```python
import sys
from typing import Any, List

stdin = sys.stdin
stdout = sys.stdout
test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(test_cases):
    n = int(input())
    result = list()
    if not func_1(n - 1, result):
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(result))
        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))

def func_1(number: int, sequence: List[int]) -> bool:
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns:
        bool: True if the sequence is generated, False otherwise
    """
    assert number >= 0
    if number == 0:
        return True
    size_overlap = (0, 0)
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size = i + 1
        value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = (size, i)
            break
    else:
        return False  # No valid size_overlap found
    (size, overlap) = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
    return func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
```

This fix ensures that the program correctly handles the edge cases and returns \(-1\) when it is impossible to generate the required sequence.
