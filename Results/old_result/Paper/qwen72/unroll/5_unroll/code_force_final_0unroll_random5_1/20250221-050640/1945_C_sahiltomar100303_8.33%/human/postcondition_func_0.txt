The function `func` processes multiple internal test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '0' and '1'. It determines and prints the optimal index `i` (0-based) for laying a road such that the number of residents who want to live on the left side and the number of residents who want to live on the right side are as balanced as possible. If multiple indices provide the same balance, it prints the index closest to the middle of the street. If no valid division can be found, it prints the index that minimizes the imbalance. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
