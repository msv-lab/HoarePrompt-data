You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all test cases. The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged as they are input values for each iteration. The output for each test case is printed according to the logic inside the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i-th` bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would be less or equal to `a`.
   - If `b > a`, Bob should consider selling the first `k` buns at the modified price to maximize profit. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a` because selling more than `b - a` buns at the modified price would result in prices less than `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - If `b <= a`, the profit is simply `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, the profit is the sum of the prices of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price plus the prices of the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.
   - The sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \((b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k // 2\).

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
   - If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`.
   - If `b > a`, it calculates the profit using the formula \((b + (b - k + 1)) \cdot k // 2 + (n - k) \cdot a\) and prints the result.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`.
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` buns sold at the modified price using the arithmetic series formula.
   - The program correctly adds the profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
