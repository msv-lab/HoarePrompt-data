### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses functions to read input efficiently. `func_1` reads an integer, `func_2` reads a string, `func_3` reads multiple integers, and `func_4` reads a list of integers. These functions are used to parse the input for the number of test cases, the graph size, and the edges.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex is mapped to a list of its neighbors. This is a common and efficient way to represent a graph in Python.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is done to ensure that the heaviest edges are considered first, which is a key part of the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - The program uses a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to manage the connected components of the graph. The DSU is used to find and union sets, and it also keeps track of the minimum edge weight in each component.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle.

6. **DFS for Cycle Path:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual path of the cycle. It uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited). If a node is revisited while it is being visited, a cycle is detected, and the path is returned.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle. It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Cycle Detection in DSU:**
   - The program incorrectly updates the DSU when a cycle is detected. The line `dsu.union(u, v, w)` should not be called if `parent_u == parent_v` because it would incorrectly union the sets and potentially overwrite the minimum edge weight.

2. **DFS Path Return:**
   - The `dfs` function should return the path starting from the first occurrence of the cycle and ending at the current node. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and may return an incomplete or incorrect path.

3. **Cycle Path Construction:**
   - The `dfs` function should ensure that the path is constructed correctly and that it includes all nodes in the cycle. The current implementation may not do this correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has issues in cycle detection and path construction. The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly find and print the simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
