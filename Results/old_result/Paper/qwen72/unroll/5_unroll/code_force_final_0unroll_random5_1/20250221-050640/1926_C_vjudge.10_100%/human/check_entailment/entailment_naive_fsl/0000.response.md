Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It preprocesses the sum of the digits of all numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores these sums in an array. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed sum for the given number \(n\), which ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test. The preprocessing step ensures that the sum of the digits for each number is calculated only once, and the retrieval for each test case is done in constant time. This approach handles all edge cases and inputs within the specified range.
