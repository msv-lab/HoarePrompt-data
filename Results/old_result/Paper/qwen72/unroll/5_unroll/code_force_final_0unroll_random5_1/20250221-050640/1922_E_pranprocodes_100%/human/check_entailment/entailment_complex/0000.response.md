Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and each test case value `x` from the input.
2. **Initialization**: The function initializes `max` and `min` to the appropriate bounds as specified in the problem description.
3. **Subsequence Construction**:
   - The function constructs the array `ans` by appending values based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - When `x` is even, it appends the current `max` value and decrements `max`. This ensures that the appended values are distinct and in descending order.
   - When `x` is odd, it appends the current `min` value and increments `min`. This ensures that the appended values are distinct and in ascending order.
   - The function reduces `x` by either halving it (if even) or subtracting 1 (if odd) until `x` becomes 1.
4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the constructed array `t` and the array `ans` in reverse order.
   - The reverse order ensures that the array is in the correct order to form the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly constructs an array that has exactly `x` increasing subsequences.
   - For an even `x`, appending the largest value and halving `x` ensures that the number of subsequences is reduced by a factor of 2.
   - For an odd `x`, appending the smallest value and decrementing `x` ensures that the number of subsequences is reduced by 1.
   - The process continues until `x` is reduced to 1, which means the array has been constructed to have exactly `x` increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `x` is 2 by appending a single value and printing it.
   - The function handles larger values of `x` by iteratively reducing `x` and constructing the array accordingly.

7. **Constraints**:
   - The function ensures that the length of the array is at most 200, as required by the problem.
   - The values in the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
