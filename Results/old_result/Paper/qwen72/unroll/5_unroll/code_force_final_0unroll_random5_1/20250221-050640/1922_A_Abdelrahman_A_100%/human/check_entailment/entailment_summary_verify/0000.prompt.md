You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `tests` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `slength`, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `slength` from user input. The function checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` at a given position is not found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the inner loop; otherwise, it prints 'NO' at the end of each test case. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. After `tests` iterations, the function completes its execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a logical flaw in its approach to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if each character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. This is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the conditions for matching the template.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
- For the given input, a valid template could be "ABC". 
- The strings `a` and `b` match this template because:
  - `a[0]` (which is 'a') is different from 'A'.
  - `a[1]` (which is 'b') is different from 'B'.
  - `a[2]` (which is 'c') is different from 'C'.
  - Similarly, `b[0]` (which is 'd') is different from 'A'.
  - `b[1]` (which is 'e') is different from 'B'.
  - `b[2]` (which is 'f') is different from 'C'.
- The string `c` does not match this template because:
  - `c[0]` (which is 'g') is different from 'A'.
  - `c[1]` (which is 'h') is different from 'B'.
  - `c[2]` (which is 'i') is different from 'C'.

However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it checks if each character in `c` is not present in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, which is not the correct condition for matching the template.
