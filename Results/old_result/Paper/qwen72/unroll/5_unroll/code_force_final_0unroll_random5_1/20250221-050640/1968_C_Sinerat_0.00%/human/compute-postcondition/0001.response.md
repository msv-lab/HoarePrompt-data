Output State: **For each test case, the function prints a list `a` where the first element is 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the input list `x` up to that index, starting from the first element of `x`. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and `n` and `a` are reset for each new test case.**
