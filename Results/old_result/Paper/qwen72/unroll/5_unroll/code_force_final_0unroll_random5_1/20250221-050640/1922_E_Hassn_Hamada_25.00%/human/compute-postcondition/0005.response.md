The only variables in the loop head are `size` and `number`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`. 

Right before the loop, `size` is 1 and `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18. 

Let's calculate the value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1` when `size` is 1:
- `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1` = `(1 << 2) - 1` = `4 - 1` = `3`

For the loop to execute the first time, `3` must be less than or equal to `number`. Since `number` is already constrained to be at least 2, the current state ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18. `size` is 1. `number` is not equal to 0.**
