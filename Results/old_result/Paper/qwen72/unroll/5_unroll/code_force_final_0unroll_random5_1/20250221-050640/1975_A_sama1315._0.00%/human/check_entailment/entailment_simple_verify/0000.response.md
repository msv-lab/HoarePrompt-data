### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, but the key is to find if there exists a single split point that, when swapped, results in a non-decreasing array.

2. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if the array is already sorted and does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array.
   - This assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` indeed only checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
     - It checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
     - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
     - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
     - **Issue**: The function does not consider the possibility of splitting the array into two parts and swapping them to achieve a non-decreasing order.

   - **Function 2**:
     - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`.
     - It processes multiple test cases.
     - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
     - It calls `func_1` for each array and collects the results.
     - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
     - **Issue**: Since `func_1` is incorrect, the results collected by `func_2` will also be incorrect.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program as a whole is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
   - To fix this, `func_1` should be modified to check for the existence of a valid split point where the array can be divided into two parts, and after swapping, the resulting array is non-decreasing.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array can be split into two parts and swapped to become non-decreasing. The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.
