Precondition: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each a_i represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, which is 2^{a_i}. The total number of test cases, t, is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
