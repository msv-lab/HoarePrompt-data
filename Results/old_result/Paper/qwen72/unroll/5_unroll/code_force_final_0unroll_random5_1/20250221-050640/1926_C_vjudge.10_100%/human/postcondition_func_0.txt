The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases, and ensures `t` is between 1 and \(10^4\). It then precomputes a list `values` where each element at index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `value` from the input, and prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to `value`. The function does not handle invalid inputs or return error messages. After the function concludes, `t` remains the same input integer, `inf` is 200001, and `values` contains the precomputed cumulative sums.
