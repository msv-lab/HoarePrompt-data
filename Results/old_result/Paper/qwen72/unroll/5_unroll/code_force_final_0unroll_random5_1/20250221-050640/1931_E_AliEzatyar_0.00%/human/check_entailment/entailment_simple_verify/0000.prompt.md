You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly for all potential cases:

1. **Typo in the Output**: The program incorrectly prints "Sashah" instead of "Sasha" when Sasha wins. This is a clear error that would cause the output to be incorrect for any test case where Sasha wins.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program calculates the total number of digits in the list and then subtracts the number of trailing zeros in pairs. However, this does not accurately reflect the game's rules, which involve reversing digits and concatenating numbers. The correct approach should consider the optimal moves for both players, which the current logic does not handle.

3. **Handling of Reversing Digits**: The program does not actually reverse the digits of the numbers as required by Anna's move. Instead, it only counts the trailing zeros, which is not sufficient to determine the outcome of the game.

4. **Concatenation Logic**: The program does not implement the concatenation logic for Sasha's move, which is crucial for determining the final number in the list.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Reverse the digits of the numbers as Anna's move.
- Implement the concatenation logic for Sasha's move.
- Use a strategy to determine the optimal moves for both players and the final outcome of the game.

Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses these issues:

```python
def reverse_number(num):
    return int(str(num)[::-1])

def can_sasha_win(array, m):
    # Reverse the digits of all numbers as Anna's move
    reversed_array = [reverse_number(num) for num in array]
    
    # Sort the array to consider the largest numbers first
    reversed_array.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # If there is only one number left after Anna's move, check if it is >= 10^m
    if len(reversed_array) == 1:
        return reversed_array[0] >= 10**m
    
    # If there are more than one number, Sasha can always concatenate the two largest numbers
    while len(reversed_array) > 1:
        a = reversed_array.pop(0)
        b = reversed_array.pop(0)
        concatenated = int(str(a) + str(b))
        reversed_array.append(concatenated)
        reversed_array.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # After the game ends, check if the final number is >= 10^m
    return reversed_array[0] >= 10**m

n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_sasha_win(array, m):
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

This corrected version ensures that the digits are reversed correctly and that Sasha's moves are handled by concatenating the two largest numbers. It then checks if the final number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\) to determine the winner.
