Precondition: **The function should take a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates (x_i, y_i) satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.**
