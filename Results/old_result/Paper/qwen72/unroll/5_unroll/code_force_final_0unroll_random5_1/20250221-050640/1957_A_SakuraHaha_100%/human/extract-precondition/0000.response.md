Precondition: **The function should take a list of integers `a` representing the lengths of the sticks, and an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases `t`, the number of sticks `n`, and the list of stick lengths `a`. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and a list `a` of stick lengths. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (1, [1]),
    (2, [1, 1]),
    (6, [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]),
    (9, [4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 4, 4])
]
```

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and test_cases is a list of t tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list a of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.**
