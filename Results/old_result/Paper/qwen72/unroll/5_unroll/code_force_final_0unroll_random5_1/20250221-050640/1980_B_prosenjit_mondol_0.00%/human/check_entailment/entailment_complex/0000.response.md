### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, processing each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The favorite cube index `f` is adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert it to a 0-based index.
   - The number of cubes to be removed `k` is also adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert it to a 0-based index.

3. **Sorting the List:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Determining the Outcome:**
   - The value of the favorite cube `x` is stored in the variable `x`.
   - The function then checks the value of the cube at index `k` in the sorted list `a`:
     - If `a[k] > x`, it means the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes, so it will not be removed. The function prints 'NO'.
     - If `a[k] < x`, it means the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes, so it will be removed. The function prints 'YES'.
     - If `a[k] == x`, it means the favorite cube could be among the first `k` cubes or not, depending on the relative order of cubes with the same value. The function checks if `k` is the last index (`k == n - 1`) or if the value at `a[k - 1]` is less than `x`. If either condition is true, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k` is the last index (`k == n - 1`), ensuring that the favorite cube is considered for removal.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `a[k] == x` and `k` is not the last index, checking the value at `a[k - 1]` to determine if the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case as expected, sorts the list in non-increasing order, and determines whether the favorite cube will be removed based on the values and positions in the sorted list.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
