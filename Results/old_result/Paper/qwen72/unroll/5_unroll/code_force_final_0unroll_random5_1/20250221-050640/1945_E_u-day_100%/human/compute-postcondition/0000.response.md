Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise -1.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated by the function `func_1()`, which returns two new values.
- The initial state information about `arr` and `pos` remains valid, as these variables are not affected by the code snippet.
