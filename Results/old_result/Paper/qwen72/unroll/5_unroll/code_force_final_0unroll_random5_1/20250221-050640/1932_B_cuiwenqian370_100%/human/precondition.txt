The function `main` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of signs, and a list of integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs. The function should process each test case and return the year in which the n-th sign will occur.
