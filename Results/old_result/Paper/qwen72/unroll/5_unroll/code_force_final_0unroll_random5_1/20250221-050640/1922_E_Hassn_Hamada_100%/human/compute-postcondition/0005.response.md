The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the result of `max(sequence, default=0)`. To ensure the loop executes, the conditions related to these objects must be adjusted. The loop iterates from the maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) down to -1, decrementing by 1 each time.

For the loop to execute:
1. The maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) must be greater than or equal to 0.
2. The variable `i` must start at the maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty) and be decremented down to -1.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18.
- `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, all elements of `sequence` are in the range [-10^9; 10^9].
- `number` is not equal to 0.
- `size_overlap` is (0, 0).

We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute at least once. This means:
- `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `i` must start at this maximum value and be decremented down to -1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, all elements of `sequence` are in the range [-10^9; 10^9], `number` is not equal to 0, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `max(sequence, default=0)` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`**
