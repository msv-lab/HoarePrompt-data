You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context where the input is provided in a specific format, which includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, followed by three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: The value of `l` will be 'NO' for each test case, as the `else` block of the inner loop sets `l` to 'NO' after the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement. The value of `t` will be unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position, it checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If this condition holds for all positions, the template can be constructed such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if the condition holds for all positions.
   - However, the program does not correctly reset the variable `l` to 'YES' at the start of each test case. This can lead to incorrect results if the previous test case set `l` to 'NO'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at the same position. In such a case, it is impossible to construct a template that matches both `a` and `b` at that position.
   - The program does not correctly determine if there exists at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - For a valid template to exist, for each position `i`:
     - `a[i]` and `b[i]` must be the same (since they both need to match the template).
     - `a[i]` (or `b[i]`) must be different from `c[i]` (since `c` must not match the template).

6. **Fixing the Program**:
   - The variable `l` should be reset to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
   - The program should check if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]` for all positions.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        l = 'YES'  # Reset l to 'YES' for each test case
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != b[i] or a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                l = 'NO'
                break
        print(l)
```

Explanation of the fix:
- `l` is reset to 'YES' at the start of each test case.
- The loop checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and different from `c[i]`. If any of these conditions fail, `l` is set to 'NO' and the loop breaks.

Correctness: **False**  
The original program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the conditions for a valid template and does not reset the variable `l` for each test case.
