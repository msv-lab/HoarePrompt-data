### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where `n` is the number of integers in the list and `m` is the parameter determining when Sasha wins.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over each element in `array`, converts it to a string, and adds the length of the string to `total_digits`.
   - It also calls `func_1` on each element to count the number of trailing zeros and appends this count to the `zeros` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes a string `num` and counts the number of trailing zeros.
   - It iterates from the end of the string to the beginning, incrementing a counter for each trailing zero until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - It returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It initializes `subtract_zero` to 0 and iterates over the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2, adding the values to `subtract_zero`.
   - The idea is to simulate the optimal play where Sasha can concatenate the numbers in such a way that the total number of digits is maximized, but Anna can reverse the numbers to reduce the number of trailing zeros.

5. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is true, it sets the answer to "Sashah" (which is a typo and should be "Sasha").
   - If the condition is false, it sets the answer to "Anna".

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answers for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typo in Output:** The program has a typo where it sets the answer to "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a critical error because the output format is incorrect.
- **Incorrect Logic for Trailing Zeros:** The program counts trailing zeros and subtracts them in pairs, but this logic is not entirely correct for determining the optimal play. The number of trailing zeros does not directly determine the outcome of the game. The key is to consider the total number of digits and the possibility of forming a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
- **Optimal Play Simulation:** The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both players. The logic for determining the winner based on the total number of digits and the trailing zeros is flawed.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is incorrect. The typo in the output and the flawed logic for determining the winner are significant errors that affect the correctness of the solution.

Correctness: **False**
