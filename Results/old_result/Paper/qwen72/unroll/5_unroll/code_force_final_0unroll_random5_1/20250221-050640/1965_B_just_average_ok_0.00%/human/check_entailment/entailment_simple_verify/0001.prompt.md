You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(24)]
        
        idx = 0
        
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        
        idx -= 1
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints the length of the modified list `nums` and the elements of the modified list `nums`. The length of `nums` is 25, and the elements are the powers of 2 from 1 to 2^23, excluding 2^idx, and including k - 2^idx, k + 1, and k + 2^idx + 1. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 2^{23}]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because it can represent any integer from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) (which is more than \(10^7\)) using subsets of these powers of 2.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It removes this power of 2 from the sequence and appends three new elements:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because the removed element was necessary to form `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This is a new element that is greater than `k` and can help form sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is another new element that helps in forming sums greater than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums` and the elements of the sequence.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Sequence Construction:**
  - The initial sequence of powers of 2 is a good choice because it can represent any integer in the range `[1, n]` using subsets.
  - Removing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and adding the three new elements ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.

- **Subsequence Constraints:**
  - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.
  - The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming all other sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary elements to ensure the sequence meets the conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
