To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. The state of `i` will be set by the loop itself, starting from 0. The other details provided about the function `func()` and its parameters are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for the loop to be meaningful in the context of the function, the input should be a positive integer.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
