Output State: **The loop will print the area of each square for each test case, calculated as the square of the side length (which is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the square's corners). The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the list of test cases will also remain unchanged. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` will be overwritten in each iteration of the loop.**
