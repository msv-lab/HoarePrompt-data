You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Example

Input

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1
    
    1 2 1 4
    
    3 3 2 3
    
    4 2
    
    2 1 1 1
    
    4 2 3 2
    
    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_2` to read the integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then uses `func_2` again to read the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The function `func_3` is responsible for calculating Alice's profit.
   - It initializes `sub_summ` to 0, which will store the total profit.
   - It first adds up all the `b_i` values (Bob's prices) for the items in `sec_arr`.
   - Then, it iterates over the items in `main_ar` and adds the value `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` if it is non-negative. This is intended to represent the profit Alice makes from each item after Bob takes `k` items for free.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Alice should choose items such that the sum of `b_i - a_i` is maximized, but Bob will take the `k` items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values to minimize her profit.
   - The program should sort the items based on `b_i - a_i` and then consider the top `n - k` items to maximize Alice's profit.

4. **Heap Implementation:**
   - The program uses a heap to efficiently find the `k` items with the smallest `b_i - a_i` values.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_3` does not use the heap correctly. It should push the `b_i - a_i` values into a min-heap and then pop the `k` smallest values to calculate the profit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where `k` is 0 or `n` correctly.
   - If `k` is 0, Bob takes no items for free, and Alice's profit is simply the sum of `b_i - a_i` for all items.
   - If `k` is `n`, Bob takes all items for free, and Alice's profit is 0.

### Correctness:
- The current implementation of `func_3` does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
- It does not use a heap to find the `k` smallest `b_i - a_i` values, which is necessary to ensure Bob minimizes Alice's profit.
- The logic for adding `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ` is incorrect. It should be adding `b_i - a_i` values.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

# Function to read a single integer
def func_1():
    return int(input())

# Function to read a list of integers
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())

# Function to calculate Alice's profit
def func_3(n, k, a, b):
    # Calculate the profit for each item
    profits = [b_i - a_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)]
    # Use a min-heap to find the k smallest profits
    heapq.heapify(profits)
    # Remove the k smallest profits (Bob takes these items for free)
    for _ in range(k):
        if profits:
            heapq.heappop(profits)
    # Calculate the total profit for the remaining items
    return sum(profits)

# Main function
def main():
    t = func_1()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = func_2()
        a = list(func_2())
        b = list(func_2())
        print(func_3(n, k, a, b))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. It needs to use a heap to find the `k` smallest `b_i - a_i` values and then calculate the profit accordingly.
