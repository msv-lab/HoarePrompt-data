You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case.

    #State: Output State: `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to `value` for each input `value` provided `t` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these results.
   - For each test case, the input \( n \) is an integer between 1 and \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a precomputation approach to store the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \) in an array `values`.
   - This precomputation is done once, and then for each test case, it retrieves the precomputed result in constant time.

3. **Precomputation**:
   - The array `values` is initialized with zeros.
   - For each number \( i \) from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \):
     - The sum of the digits of \( i \) is calculated by converting \( i \) to a string and summing the integer values of its characters.
     - The cumulative sum of digit sums is stored in `values[i]` as `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The number of test cases \( t \) is read from input.
   - For each test case, the value \( n \) is read, and the precomputed result `values[n]` is printed.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(2 \cdot 10^5 \cdot \log(2 \cdot 10^5)) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - Each test case is handled in \( O(1) \) time, which is very fast and within the 0.5 seconds limit.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number.
   - The cumulative sum is stored correctly.
   - The results for each test case are retrieved and printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficient for the given problem and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
