You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and is a balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` represents the depth of the parentheses at position `i` in `s`, starting from 0. The final value of `d[n]` is 0, indicating that the sequence is balanced.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: `ans` is a reversed string of `s`, and `d` remains the same sorted list of tuples.
    return ans
    #The program returns the reversed string of `s`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")", and returns the reversed string of `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` and prints the result.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1(s)` is defined to take a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position. The initial balance is set to 0.

3. **Balance Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The dictionary `d` is updated with the balance at each position.

4. **Dictionary Manipulation:**
   - The program removes the last element from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`.
   - It then sorts the dictionary items based on the balance (`x[1]`) in increasing order and, for ties, by the position (`x[0]`) in decreasing order.

5. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending characters from the input string `s` based on the sorted positions.
   - Finally, it returns the result string `ans`.

### Analysis:

- **Balance Calculation:**
  - The balance is correctly calculated for each prefix of the string.
  - The dictionary `d` stores the balance at each position, which is necessary for the balanced shuffle operation.

- **Sorting:**
  - The sorting step is crucial. The program sorts the dictionary items by balance in increasing order and, for ties, by position in decreasing order.
  - This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

- **Result Construction:**
  - The program constructs the result string by appending characters from the input string based on the sorted positions.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues:

- **Dictionary Initialization:**
  - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is correct for the balance at the start of the string.
  - However, the dictionary should be initialized with `d[0] = 0` and then updated for each position from 1 to n-1. The program correctly updates the balance for each position.

- **Dictionary Removal:**
  - The program removes the last element from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`. This is necessary because the balance at the last position is not needed for the sorting step.
  - This step is correct and necessary.

- **Character Appending:**
  - The program appends characters from the input string based on the sorted positions.
  - This step is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. It calculates the balance, sorts the positions, and constructs the result string accordingly.

### Correctness:
**True**
