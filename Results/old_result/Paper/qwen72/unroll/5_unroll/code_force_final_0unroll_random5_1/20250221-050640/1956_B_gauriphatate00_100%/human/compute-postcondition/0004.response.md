The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `count_a` is a dictionary and `max_score` is 0, but these do not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `num` will start at 1.

State: **`count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the number of times that integer appears in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged. `max_score` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `num` is 1**
