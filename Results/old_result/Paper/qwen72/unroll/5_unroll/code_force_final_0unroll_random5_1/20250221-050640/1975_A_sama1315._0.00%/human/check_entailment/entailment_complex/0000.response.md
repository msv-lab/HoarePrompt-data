Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the problem requires checking if the array can be sorted by performing the specified operation (splitting and swapping the prefix and suffix) any number of times, not just if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order. It only checks the current order of the array.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1` to check if the array can be sorted.
   - The results of `func_1` are collected and printed.

Given the problem description, the function `func_1` is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by the allowed operations. The function should check if there exists a valid split point such that the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix.

To correctly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should:
- Identify the point where the array first breaks the non-decreasing order.
- Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting at this point and swapping the prefix and suffix.
- If the array can be made non-decreasing by this operation, return 'Yes'; otherwise, return 'No'.

Since `func_1` does not perform these checks, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
