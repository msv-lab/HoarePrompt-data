The function `func` reads an integer `tests` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `slength`, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `slength` from user input. The function checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` at a given position is not found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the inner loop; otherwise, it prints 'NO' at the end of each test case. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `c`. After `tests` iterations, the function completes its execution.
