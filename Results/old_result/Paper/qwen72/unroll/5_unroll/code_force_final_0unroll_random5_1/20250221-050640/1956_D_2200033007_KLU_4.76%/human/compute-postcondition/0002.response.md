Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

**Initial State:**
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
- Each element `a_i` in `c` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is 2.

However, there is a contradiction in the initial state. The statement "The current value of `c` is 2" is ambiguous because `c` is described as a list, not a single integer. If we assume that `c` is a list and the current value of `c` is a list with a single element `2`, then we can proceed with this assumption.

**Python Code Snippet:**
```
print(f'4 1')
```

**Explanation:**
- The `print` statement is using an f-string to format the output.
- The f-string contains the literal values '4' and '1' separated by a space.
- The values '4' and '1' are not dependent on any variables or objects in the initial state.

**Output:**
Output: **4 1**
