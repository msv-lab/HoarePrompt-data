The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `index` and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
