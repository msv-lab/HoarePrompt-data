To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, and it will start from 0 by default.
2. The loop will execute if the value passed to `range` is greater than 0. This value comes from `int(input())`.

Given the state before the loop starts, the function should take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and a string `s` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters, with the length of `s` equal to `n`.

However, the loop head is using `int(input())` to determine the number of iterations, which is not directly related to the parameters `t` and the list of tuples. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
