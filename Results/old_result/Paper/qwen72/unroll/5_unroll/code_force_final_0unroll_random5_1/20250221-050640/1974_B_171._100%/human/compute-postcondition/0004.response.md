Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from `encoded` is mapped to its reverse in the sorted list `unique_chars`. The keys of `char_map` are the characters from `unique_chars` in their original order, and the values are the characters from `unique_chars` in reverse order. The variables `encoded`, `unique_chars`, and `len_unique` remain unchanged.
