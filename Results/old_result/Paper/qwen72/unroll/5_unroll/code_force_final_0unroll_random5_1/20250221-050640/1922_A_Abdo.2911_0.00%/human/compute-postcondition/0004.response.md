Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from the input. For each test case, it takes three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of equal length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and checks if `a` and `b` can be transformed into a common template string where characters that differ between `a` and `b` are uppercased. It then checks if `c` matches this template string. If `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. **
