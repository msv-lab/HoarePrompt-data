You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains the same input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to `value` for each input `value` provided `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `n` (a list of integers for each test case). If `t` is out of the valid range (less than 1 or greater than \(10^4\)), it returns an error message indicating invalid number of test cases. If any integer in `n` is out of the valid range (less than 1 or greater than \(2 \cdot 10^5\)), it returns an error message indicating an invalid test case value. If all inputs are valid, it processes each test case and returns a list of results.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
