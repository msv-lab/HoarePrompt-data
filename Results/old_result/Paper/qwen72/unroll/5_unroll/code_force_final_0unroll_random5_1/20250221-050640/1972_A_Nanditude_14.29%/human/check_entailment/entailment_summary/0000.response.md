Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the minimum number of new problems to be proposed so that the difficulty of each problem \( a_i \) is less than or equal to the expected difficulty \( b_i \) for all \( i \). The provided program attempts to solve this by iterating through both arrays \( a \) and \( b \) and inserting new problems into \( a \) when necessary to ensure \( a_i \leq b_i \).

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Insertion and Deletion Logic**:
   - The program uses `a.pop(-1)` to remove the last element of \( a \), which is correct.
   - However, the insertion logic `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` is incorrect. This logic inserts the element \( b[j] \) at position \( i \) and shifts the rest of the elements to the right. This does not maintain the non-decreasing order of \( a \) after the insertion, which is crucial for the problem's constraints.

2. **Inefficient and Incorrect Approach**:
   - The program should maintain the non-decreasing order of \( a \) after each insertion and deletion. The correct approach would be to insert the new problem at the appropriate position to keep \( a \) sorted and then remove the last element.
   - The current logic does not ensure that \( a \) remains sorted after each insertion, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Unnecessary Function**:
   - The function `func_1` is not used in the main logic of the program and does not contribute to solving the problem. It sorts the entire list in reverse order, which is not required for the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
