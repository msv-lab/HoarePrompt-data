Output State: **The variable `t` is unchanged, `test_cases` is unchanged, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `total_bullets_used` is the total number of bullets used for the last test case, and `success` is a boolean indicating whether it was possible to defeat all monsters in the last test case. The loop prints 'YES' if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' for each test case.**
