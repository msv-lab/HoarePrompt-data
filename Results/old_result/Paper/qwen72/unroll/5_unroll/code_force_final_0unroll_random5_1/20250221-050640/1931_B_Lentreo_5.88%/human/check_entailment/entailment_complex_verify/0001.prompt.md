You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `t` is 0, and the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged for each test case. The variable `last` holds the last element of the list `nums` for the last test case, and `curr` holds the result of the computation for the last test case. The output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `if curr == 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then checks if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. If the sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition described. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are used internally and are not returned or modified outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers, each with a certain amount of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - Since the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from any container to any container with a higher index. This means we can only move water to the right, not to the left.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm should check if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by only pouring water to the right.
   - If the last container (index `n-1`) already has the target amount of water, then it is impossible to pour water into it from any other container, and we need to check if the remaining containers can be balanced.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - The program then calculates the difference between each container's water and the last container's water.
   - It sums these differences and checks if the sum is zero.
   - If the sum is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the last container's water amount is the target amount for all containers.
   - The correct target amount should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the last container's water amount is not the target amount.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the target amount of water for each container and does not properly check if it is possible to balance the containers by pouring water to the right.

### Correctness:
**False**
