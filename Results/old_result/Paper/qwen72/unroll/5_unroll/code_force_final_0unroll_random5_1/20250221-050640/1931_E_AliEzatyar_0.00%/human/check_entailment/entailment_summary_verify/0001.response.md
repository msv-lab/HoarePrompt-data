### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over each item in the `array` and adds the length of the string representation of the item to `total_digits`.
   - It also calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends the count to the `zeros` list.

3. **Trailing Zeros Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order and then iterates over it in steps of 2, summing up the values at even indices to `subtract_zero`.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answers for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The answer should be 'Sasha' instead of 'Sashah'. This is a minor typo but will cause the program to output incorrect results.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but the typo in the output string 'Sashah' will cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified the typo and provided a corrected version of the program. The logic of the program is sound and should work as intended once the typo is fixed.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect due to the typo in the output string 'Sashah'. Once this typo is corrected, the program will be correct.

Final: **False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- The only change made is correcting the string 'Sashah' to 'Sasha' in the line `answers[test] = 'Sashah'`.

This correction will ensure that the program outputs the correct results for the given problem description.
