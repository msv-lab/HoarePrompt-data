Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted by the given operations. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. However, it is called before and after the main loop, which is not the correct approach. The function should be used to check the array after each potential operation to see if it is sorted.

2. **Incorrect Operation Logic**:
   - The program attempts to split the elements in the array only if the previous element is greater than the current element and is greater than 10. This is not the correct approach because the operation should be applied to any element that is at least 10, not just when it is greater than the next element.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the current element itself is greater than 10 and needs to be split.

3. **Inefficient and Incomplete**:
   - The program does not consider all possible ways to split elements and check if the array can be sorted. It only splits elements in a specific order and does not explore all possible splits.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Iterate through the array and split any element that is at least 10.
- After splitting, check if the array is sorted.
- If the array is sorted, print 'YES'. If not, continue splitting elements until no more elements can be split or the array is sorted.
- If the array cannot be sorted after all possible splits, print 'NO'.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    while True:
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
                new_arr.extend(digits)
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        if new_arr == arr:
            break
        arr = new_arr
    return arr == sorted(arr)

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if can_be_sorted(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`can_be_sorted` Function**:
  - This function repeatedly splits any element in the array that is at least 10 until no more elements can be split.
  - After each split, it checks if the array is sorted.
  - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`. If no more splits are possible and the array is not sorted, it returns `False`.

- **Main Loop**:
  - For each test case, it reads the array and calls the `can_be_sorted` function.
  - Based on the return value, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

This approach ensures that all possible splits are considered and the array is checked for sorting after each split.
