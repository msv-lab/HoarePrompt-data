Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` (counting from the end, starting from 0).
   - `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `outind` is 0.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `inpstr`.

3. **Expression in the `print` Statement:**
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` is what will be printed.
   - `len(inpstr)` gives the total number of characters in the string `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' from the end, which means it is the position of the last 'B' in the string.
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' from the beginning, which means it is the position of the first 'B' in the string.

4. **Calculating the Output:**
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` can be interpreted as the total length of the string minus the sum of the indices of the first and last 'B'.
   - This calculation essentially gives the number of characters between the first and last 'B' (excluding the 'B's themselves).

5. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `inpstr = "AABBBCC"`.
     - `ind1` (index of the first 'B') is 2.
     - `ind2` (index of the last 'B') is 4.
     - `len(inpstr)` is 7.
     - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` becomes `7 - 4 - 2 = 1`.

6. **General Case:**
   - For any string `inpstr`, the expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` will give the number of characters between the first and last 'B' (excluding the 'B's themselves).

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the number of characters between the first and last 'B' in the string `inpstr` (excluding the 'B's themselves).

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where len(inpstr) is the length of the string inpstr, ind1 is the index of the first 'B' in inpstr, and ind2 is the index of the last 'B' in inpstr)**
