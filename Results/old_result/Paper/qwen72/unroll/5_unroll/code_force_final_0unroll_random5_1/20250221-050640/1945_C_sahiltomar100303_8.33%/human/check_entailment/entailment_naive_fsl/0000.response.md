Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house or after the last house to satisfy the condition. For example, consider the input where `n = 3` and `s = "000"`. According to the problem description, the road should be laid before the first house (output should be `0`), but the program does not correctly handle this case and may output an incorrect position. The program also does not correctly handle the case where the road should be laid after the last house, such as when `n = 3` and `s = "111"`. In this case, the output should be `3`, but the program may not produce the correct result.
