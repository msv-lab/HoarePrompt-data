### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch on a grid with specific rules for movements, catching, throwing, and scoring.
   - The grid dimensions \(N \times M\) are given, and the game consists of \(T\) steps.
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as the Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team, and scoring in one's own goal gives a point to the opponent.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include all events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1(obj, d)`:**
     - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
     - It correctly handles the movement of entities by modifying the position in place.
     - The function is logically sound and aligns with the problem's movement rules.

   - **Function `func_2(t)`:**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
     - The function sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing the events, which is consistent with the problem requirements.
     - The function does not return any value, which is appropriate for this task.

3. **Missing Components:**
   - The provided code snippets are incomplete and do not cover the entire problem.
   - **Initialization:**
     - The code does not initialize the `player`, `blud`, `quaffle`, `goals`, and other necessary variables.
   - **Scoring Goals:**
     - There is no function to handle the scoring of goals.
     - The code does not check if a player has left the Quaffle at a goal and update the score accordingly.
   - **Catching and Throwing the Quaffle:**
     - There is no function to handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
     - The code does not manage the state of the Quaffle (whether it is being carried or not).
   - **Resetting the Quaffle:**
     - The code does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - **Printing the Final Score:**
     - The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code lacks the necessary logic to handle the game's core functionalities.
   - Without the initialization of the game state, the code cannot correctly simulate the game.
   - The absence of functions to handle scoring, catching, and throwing the Quaffle means the game cannot progress as required.
   - The final score is not printed, which is a critical part of the output.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code snippets are not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
   - The code lacks essential functionalities such as initializing the game state, handling scoring, and managing the Quaffle.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
