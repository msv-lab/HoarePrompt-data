Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and m, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept two parameters, `n` and `m`, and possibly an additional parameter for the number of test cases, `t`. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n, m):
```

But for the purpose of this task, I will provide the precondition based on the given function definition, assuming it will be corrected to accept the necessary parameters:

Precondition: **n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.**
