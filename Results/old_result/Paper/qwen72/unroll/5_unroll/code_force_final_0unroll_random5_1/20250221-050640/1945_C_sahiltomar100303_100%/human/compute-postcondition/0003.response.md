The function `func` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters.
