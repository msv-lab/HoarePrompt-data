The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, and it does not need to be adjusted. The state of the function parameters (t and the list of tuples) is not directly related to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable**
