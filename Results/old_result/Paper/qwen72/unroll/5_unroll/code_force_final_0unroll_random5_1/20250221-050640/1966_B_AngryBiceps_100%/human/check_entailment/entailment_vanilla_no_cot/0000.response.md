Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by checking the conditions that would make it impossible to turn the entire grid into a single color. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the grid and the initial colors of the squares.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the first row and the last row of the grid are both uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid a single color. This is because any operation that changes the color of the first row will not affect the last row, and vice versa, if they start with different colors.
   - Similarly, if the first column and the last column of the grid are both uniform but different from each other, it is also impossible to make the entire grid a single color. This is because any operation that changes the color of the first column will not affect the last column, and vice versa, if they start with different colors.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program outputs 'YES'. This is because if there are no uniform rows or columns with different colors, it is always possible to make the entire grid a single color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

The program efficiently checks these conditions and prints the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
