### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - The return for the i-th outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by `k_i`.
   - If no such distribution exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`. The LCM is calculated as the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This is correct and useful for finding the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - **`func_2(numbers)`**: This function computes the LCM of a list of integers `numbers`. It iteratively applies `func_1` to the list elements, starting with the first element. The final result is the LCM of all the multipliers `k_i`.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
   - It computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2(k)`.
   - It then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome as `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If it is not, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - If the sum of the bets is less than `m`, it prints the bets.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the return for any winning outcome is a multiple of the LCM.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the LCM, which is the minimum amount required to ensure a win for any outcome.
   - If `sum(c) >= m`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Example Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `k = [3, 2, 7]`
     - `m = LCM(3, 2, 7) = 42`
     - `c = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
     - `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 < 42`
     - Output: `14 21 6` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `k = [3, 3]`
     - `m = LCM(3, 3) = 3`
     - `c = [3 // 3, 3 // 3] = [1, 1]`
     - `sum(c) = 1 + 1 = 2 < 3`
     - Output: `1 1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`
     - `m = LCM(5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5`
     - `c = [5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5, 5 // 5] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - `sum(c) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 >= 5`
     - Output: `-1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - `k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13]`
     - `m = LCM(7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13) = 1989`
     - `c = [1989 // 7, 1989 // 9, 1989 // 3, 1989 // 17, 1989 // 9, 1989 // 13] = [284, 221, 663, 117, 221, 153]`
     - `sum(c) = 284 + 221 + 663 + 117 + 221 + 153 = 1659 < 1989`
     - Output: `284 221 663 117 221 153` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 5:**
     - `k = [6, 3, 2]`
     - `m = LCM(6, 3, 2) = 6`
     - `c = [6 // 6, 6 // 3, 6 // 2] = [1, 2, 3]`
     - `sum(c) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 >= 6`
     - Output: `-1` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 6:**
     - `k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3]`
     - `m = LCM(9, 4, 6, 8, 3) = 72`
     - `c = [72 // 9, 72 // 4, 72 // 6, 72 // 8, 72 // 3] = [8, 18, 12, 9, 24]`
     - `sum(c) = 8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 71 < 72`
     - Output: `8 18 12 9 24` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets for each outcome and ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The function `func_2` correctly computes the LCM, and the main program logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
