You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max = 100000000
        min = -100000000
        ans = []
        t = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans.append(max)
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans.append(min)
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        ans.reverse()
        print(t)

    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and X is a list of integers where each element x satisfies 2 <= x <= 10^18. The loop prints the number of iterations (t) it took to reduce each x to 1, followed by a list of integers (ans) that were appended during the iterations, in reverse order. The values of max and min are unchanged for each new x, but they are modified within each iteration of the loop for a given x.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to construct an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, the program should print \(-1\).
   - The array elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( X \).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program initializes `max` to \( 10^8 \) and `min` to \( -10^8 \).
   - It uses a list `ans` to store the elements of the array.
   - It iterates while \( X \) is not equal to 1:
     - If \( X \) is even, it appends the current `max` to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides \( X \) by 2.
     - If \( X \) is odd, it appends the current `min` to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from \( X \).
   - It reverses the list `ans` to ensure the correct order of elements.
   - It prints the length of the array and the array itself.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Even \( X \)**: When \( X \) is even, the program appends the largest possible value and divides \( X \) by 2. This is a valid step because appending a large value does not create new increasing subsequences with the existing elements.
   - **Odd \( X \)**: When \( X \) is odd, the program appends the smallest possible value and subtracts 1 from \( X \). This is a valid step because appending a small value can create new increasing subsequences with the existing elements.
   - **Reversal**: The reversal of the list ensures that the elements are in the correct order to form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Length Constraint**: The program does not explicitly check if the length of the array exceeds 200. However, the operations (dividing by 2 and subtracting 1) ensure that the number of iterations is logarithmic in \( X \), which is much less than 200 for \( X \leq 10^{18} \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **\( X = 2 \)**: The program correctly outputs a single element array \([0]\).
   - **\( X = 5 \)**: The program correctly outputs an array \([0, 1, 0]\).
   - **\( X = 13 \)**: The program correctly outputs an array \([2, 2, 3, 4, 2]\).
   - **\( X = 37 \)**: The program correctly outputs an array \([-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program appears to handle the problem correctly and efficiently.
   - The logic for constructing the array and the constraints are satisfied.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly constructs an array that meets the problem's requirements for the given test cases and should work for other valid inputs as well.
