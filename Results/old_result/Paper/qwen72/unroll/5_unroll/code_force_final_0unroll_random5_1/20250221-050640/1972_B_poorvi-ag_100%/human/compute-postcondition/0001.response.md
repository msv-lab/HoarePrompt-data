Output State: **The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. `t` is now an integer read from the input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, where each character is either "U" or "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). `results` is an empty list.**
