#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the integer result of the absolute value of their product divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has computed and returned this integer value, which represents the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer represents a multiplier \( k_i \) such that \( 2 \le k_i \le 20 \).
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `result` is the product of all integers in the `numbers` list, and `numbers` remains unchanged.
    return result
    #The program returns the product of all integers in the `numbers` list, and `numbers` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `numbers` where each integer is between 2 and 20. It returns the product of all integers in the list, and the list `numbers` remains unchanged.
