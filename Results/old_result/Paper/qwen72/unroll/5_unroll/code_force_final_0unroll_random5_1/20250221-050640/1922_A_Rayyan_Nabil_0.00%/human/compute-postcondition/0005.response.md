Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n`. It checks if for every index `i` in the range of `n`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all indices, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `l` will be 'NO' for each test case, as the `else` block of the inner loop sets `l` to 'NO' after the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement. **
