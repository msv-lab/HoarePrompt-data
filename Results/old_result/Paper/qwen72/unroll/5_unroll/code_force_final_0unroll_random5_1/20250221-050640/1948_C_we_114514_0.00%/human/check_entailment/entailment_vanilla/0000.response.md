### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first or second row, respectively.
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Movement Logic**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and reach the end).
       - Otherwise, it continues to the next column.
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - It sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` (the robot can no longer stay in the first row).
       - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move down to the second row and continue moving right).

   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the end of the second row).

4. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly handles the movement of the robot based on the arrows in the grid.
- It ensures that the robot can only move to the next column or down to the second row if the arrows allow it.
- The program correctly checks if the robot can reach the last cell of the second row `(2, n)`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` is even, as specified in the problem constraints.
- It correctly processes the arrows and ensures that the robot does not move outside the grid.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
