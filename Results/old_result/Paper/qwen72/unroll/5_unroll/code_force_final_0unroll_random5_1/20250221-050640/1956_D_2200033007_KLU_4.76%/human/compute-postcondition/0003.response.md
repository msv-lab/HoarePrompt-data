Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

### Initial State:
- `c` is a list of integers of length `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 18\)).
- Each element \(a_i\) in `c` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `m` is 0.
- The current value of `c` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(f'1 2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is using an f-string to print the literal string `'1 2'`.
- The values `1` and `2` are not variables or objects; they are simply numbers included in the string.
- The initial state provides information about the list `c` and the variable `m`, but these are not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the exact string `'1 2'` as it is written in the code.

Output: **1 2**
