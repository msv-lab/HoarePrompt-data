Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m > n` and the elements in `c` are not distinct. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 4
1 2 3
1 1 1 1
```

In this case, the program will output `3`, but the correct output should be `0` because the only way to maximize the difference is to choose the same elements as in `a`, since all elements in `c` are the same and equal to `1`.

The issue arises from the logic where the program tries to maximize the difference by sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. However, this approach does not consider the case where the elements in `c` are not distinct and all are the same, leading to an incorrect result.
