#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `a` remains the same list of integers as in the initial state. `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases. `n` and `q` remain the same integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries. `c` remains the same list of integers. `queries` remains the same list of `q` pairs of integers. `b` is now a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `c`, `queries`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'NO' or 'YES' for each query based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array. It takes no parameters directly but reads input from `input()`. The function first reads two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of an array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads `n` integers into an array `a` and initializes another array `b` with the same length. The function computes a cumulative sum for `b` based on the values in `a`, where each element in `b` is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1, otherwise by 2. After computing `b`, the function computes the cumulative sum of `a` and processes `q` queries. For each query, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if the difference `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than `b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.
