The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `S` and a list `N` of `S` integers. For each test case, it prints the second smallest unique element in the sorted list `N` if there are at least two unique elements. If there are fewer than two unique elements, it prints the largest unique element in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `S`, `N`, `M`, and `cnt` are reset for each test case.
