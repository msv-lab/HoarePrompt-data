Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading the coordinates of the four corners. It calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (since the sides of the square are parallel to the coordinate axes, this difference will be the same as the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates). Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length.

However, there is a potential issue in the program. The problem statement guarantees that the input will always form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The program assumes that the side length of the square can be determined solely by the difference in x-coordinates. This assumption is correct for the given problem constraints, but it does not explicitly check if the y-coordinates also form a square of the same side length. 

Despite this, the program will still work correctly for the given problem constraints because the input is guaranteed to form a valid square. The side length calculated using the x-coordinates will always be the same as the side length calculated using the y-coordinates.

Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
