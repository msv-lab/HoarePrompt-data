### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob can sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Formula for Modified Price Buns:**
   - The total profit from the first `k` buns sold at the modified price is the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     \text{Profit from modified buns} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1)
     \]
   - This can be simplified using the formula for the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     \text{Sum} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]

3. **Formula for Usual Price Buns:**
   - The profit from the remaining `(n - k)` buns sold at the usual price is:
     \[
     \text{Profit from usual buns} = (n - k) \times a
     \]

4. **Total Profit:**
   - The total profit is the sum of the profit from modified buns and the profit from usual buns:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k \times (2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]

5. **Optimal `k`:**
   - The optimal `k` is the one that maximizes the total profit. The program sets `k` to `min(n, b - a)`, which is a reasonable approach because:
     - If `b <= a`, it is better to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price would be less or equal.
     - If `b > a`, the modified price is beneficial for the first `k` buns, but the profit from the remaining buns should still be considered.

6. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b <= a` by printing `a * n`.
   - For the case where `b > a`, the program calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)` and then uses the formula to calculate the total profit.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` up to \(10^9\).
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is very large and `b` is very small, ensuring that the profit is calculated correctly.

8. **Final Check:**
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The formula used for calculating the profit is correct and matches the arithmetic series sum formula.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.

**Correctness: True**
