Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, `n` is equal to the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of the integers in `nums`, `total % n` is equal to 0, `mean` is equal to `total // n`.**

The variable `mean` is assigned the value of `total` divided by `n` using integer division. Since `total % n` is 0, `mean` will be an integer equal to the average of the integers in `nums`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
