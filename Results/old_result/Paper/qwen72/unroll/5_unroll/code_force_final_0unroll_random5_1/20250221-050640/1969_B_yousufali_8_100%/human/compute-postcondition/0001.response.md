The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to indicate that the loop variable is not actually used within the loop body. It starts at 0 and increments with each iteration, but we do not need to specify its initial value as it is not used.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
