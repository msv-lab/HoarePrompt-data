You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In the village of Letovo, there are n houses. The villagers decided to build a
big road that will divide the village into left and right sides. Each resident
wants to live on either the right or the left side of the street, which is
described as a sequence a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n , where a_j = 0 if the resident
of the j -th house wants to live on the left side of the street; otherwise,
a_j = 1 .

The road will pass between two houses. The houses to the left of it will be
declared the left-side, and the houses to the right will be declared the
right-side. More formally, let the road pass between houses i and i+1 . Then
the houses at positions between 1 and i will be on the left side of the
street, and at positions between i+1 and n will be on the right side. The road
also may pass before the first and after the last house; in this case, the
entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, respectively.

To make the design fair, it was decided to lay the road so that at least half
of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the choice.
That is, among x residents on one side, at least \lceil\frac{x}{2}\rceil
should want to live on that side, where \lceil x \rceil denotes rounding up a
real number x .

To the left of the road, there will be i houses, among the corresponding a_j
there must be at least \lceil\frac{i}{2}\rceil zeros. To the right of the
road, there will be n-i houses, among the corresponding a_j there must be at
least \lceil\frac{n-i}{2}\rceil ones.

Determine after which house i the road should be laid in order to satisfy the
described condition and be as close to the middle of the village as possible.
Formally, among all suitable positions i , minimize \left|\frac{n}{2} -
i\right| .

If there are multiple suitable positions i with the minimum \left|\frac{n}{2}
- i\right| , output the smaller one.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ). The description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le
3\cdot 10^5 ). The next line of each test case contains a string a of length n
, consisting only of 0 and 1 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number i — the position of the house after
which the road should be laid (if it should be laid before the first house,
output 0 ). We can show that the answer always exists.

Note

Let's consider the first example of input data.

If we lay the road after the first house, there will be one house a_1 = 1 on
the left side of the street, the resident of which would like to live on the
right side of the street. Then 0 out of 1 residents on the even side will be
satisfied with the choice, which means that the road cannot be laid after
house 1 .

If we lay the road after the second house, 1 out of 2 residents on the left
side (with preferences a_1 = 1 , a_2 = 0 ) and 1 out of 1 resident on the
right side (with preference a_3 = 1 ) will be satisfied with the choice. More
than half of the residents on each side are satisfied with the choice, which
means that the road can be laid after house 2 . We can show that this is the
optimal answer.

    #State: The loop will have processed all test cases, and the output will be the positions (1-indexed) where the string can be split such that the left part has at least half of its length as '0's and the right part has at least half of its length as '1's. The variables `left`, `right`, `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, `rightOne`, `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` will be in their final states after processing the last test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The variable `mid` is set to `n // 2`, which is the middle index of the string.
   - The variables `leftZero`, `rightZero`, `leftOne`, and `rightOne` are initialized to count the number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the middle index.
   - The variables `tleftZero`, `trightZero`, `tleftOne`, and `trightOne` are also initialized to keep track of the total number of zeros and ones on the left and right sides of the middle index.

3. **Counting Initial Preferences**:
   - The first loop counts the number of zeros and ones on the left side of the middle index.
   - The second loop counts the number of zeros and ones on the right side of the middle index.

4. **Adjusting the Left Side**:
   - The `left` variable is set to `mid`.
   - The `leftMove` variable is initialized to 0.
   - The first while loop moves the road to the left as long as the number of zeros on the left side is less than the required number (`(left + 1) // 2`) or the number of ones on the right side is less than the required number (`(n - left + 1) // 2`).
   - If the road is moved to the left, the counts of zeros and ones are adjusted accordingly.

5. **Adjusting the Right Side**:
   - The `right` variable is set to `mid`.
   - The second while loop moves the road to the right as long as the number of zeros on the left side is less than the required number (`(right + 1) // 2`) or the number of ones on the right side is less than the required number (`(n - right + 1) // 2`).
   - If the road is moved to the right, the counts of zeros and ones are adjusted accordingly.

6. **Determining the Optimal Position**:
   - If the road is moved to the leftmost position (`left == 0`), it checks if the road can be moved to the rightmost position (`right != n`) and prints the rightmost position if possible.
   - If the road is moved to the rightmost position (`right == n`), it checks if the road can be moved to the leftmost position (`left != 0`) and prints the leftmost position if possible.
   - If both `left` and `right` are valid positions, it compares the distances from the middle and prints the position that is closer to the middle. If the distances are equal, it prints the smaller position.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly counts the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the middle index.
- The while loops adjust the road position to ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- The final comparison ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle as possible, and if there are multiple valid positions, it chooses the smaller one.

### Correctness:
- The program follows the problem description and constraints.
- It correctly handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house.
- The logic for adjusting the road position and determining the optimal position is sound.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
