Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and for each query, it has printed the minimum distance between the cities specified in the query. The variables `t`, `n`, `lst`, `m`, `start`, `end`, `inc`, `s`, `d1`, and `d2` are no longer in their initial states but have been used to compute the results for the queries. The final state of these variables is not explicitly defined but is the result of the loop's execution.**
