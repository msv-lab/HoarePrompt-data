Reasoning: 

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list `data`. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the corresponding passwords. This part is correctly implemented and ensures that the program can handle the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Password Verification**:
   - **Character Classification**: The program correctly separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This ensures that we can independently check the sorting conditions for digits and letters.
   - **No Digit After a Letter**: The program iterates through the password to find the last index of a digit. If it encounters a letter after a digit, it immediately returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
   - **Sorting Check**: The program checks if the `digits` list and the `letters` list are sorted in non-decreasing order. If either list is not sorted, it returns 'NO'. This correctly enforces the conditions that all digits and all letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Only Letters**: If the password contains only letters, the `digits` list will be empty, and the sorting check for `digits` will pass (an empty list is considered sorted).
   - **Only Digits**: If the password contains only digits, the `letters` list will be empty, and the sorting check for `letters` will pass (an empty list is considered sorted).
   - **Mixed Characters**: The program correctly handles mixed characters by ensuring that no digit comes after a letter and that both the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list and prints them at the end, one per line. This matches the required output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
