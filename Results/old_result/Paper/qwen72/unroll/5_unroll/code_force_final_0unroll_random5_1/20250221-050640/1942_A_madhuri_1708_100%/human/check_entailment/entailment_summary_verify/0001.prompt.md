You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3). For each subsequent line, it processes two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` equals `k`, it prints a sequence of `k` integers, each equal to `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` does not equal `k`, it prints `-1`. If `k` is less than 2, it prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Array Constraints**: Each element \( a_i \) must satisfy \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \).
2. **Sorted Cyclic Shifts**: Out of the \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array \( a \), exactly \( k \) of them must be sorted.
3. **Output**: For each test case, print a valid array \( a \) or -1 if no such array exists.

### Program Analysis:
The program reads input from standard input and processes each test case. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all lines from standard input and processes each line starting from the second one.
   - Each line contains two integers \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Conditions**:
   - **If \( k \geq 2 \)**:
     - **If \( n == k \)**:
       - The program prints an array where all elements are equal to \( k \).
       - This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.
     - **Otherwise**:
       - The program prints -1.
       - This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of constructing a valid array when \( k < n \) and \( k \geq 2 \).

   - **If \( k < 2 \)**:
     - The program prints an array where elements are \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
     - This is a valid solution because:
       - For \( k = 1 \), the array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is itself.
       - For \( k = 0 \), the array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) has no sorted cyclic shifts other than itself, which is not possible since \( k \) must be at least 1.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Case \( k = 1 \)**:
  - The program correctly prints an array \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \), which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.
  - This is correct.

- **Case \( k = n \)**:
  - The program correctly prints an array where all elements are equal to \( k \).
  - This is correct because all cyclic shifts of an array with identical elements are sorted.

- **Case \( 1 < k < n \)**:
  - The program incorrectly prints -1.
  - This is incorrect because it is possible to construct an array with exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts. For example, an array \( [1, 2, \ldots, k, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1] \) can have exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( 1 < k < n \) properly. It should be able to construct a valid array for such cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
