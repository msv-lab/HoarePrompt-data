The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates with an integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, it uses integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function operates with an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and for each test case, it uses integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9). The function returns a result based on these parameters.**
