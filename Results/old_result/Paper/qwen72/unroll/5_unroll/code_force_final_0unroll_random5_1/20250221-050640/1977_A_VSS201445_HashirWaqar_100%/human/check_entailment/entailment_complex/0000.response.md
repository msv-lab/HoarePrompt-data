Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, given the constraints. The function processes multiple test cases, reading the number of test cases `t` and then reading `n` and `m` for each test case.

The logic within the function is as follows:
1. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
2. It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
3. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Let's break down the logic:
- **Condition 1: `n >= m`**  
  This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially build a tower of height `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to build a tower of height `m` because you can only add or remove one cube per move.
- **Condition 2: `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**  
  This ensures that the number of moves left after building a tower of height `m` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove a cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves will be zero (i.e., the tower height remains unchanged). If the difference is odd, it means that after building a tower of height `m`, there will be an odd number of moves left, which cannot result in a stable tower of height `m`.

The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements. It correctly checks the conditions and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

Given the example test cases:
- For `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the function prints 'YES' because `3 >= 3` and `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0`.
- For `n = 2` and `m = 4`, the function prints 'NO' because `2 < 4`.
- For `n = 5` and `m = 3`, the function prints 'YES' because `5 >= 3` and `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0`.

All these test cases are handled correctly by the function.

Correctness: **True**
