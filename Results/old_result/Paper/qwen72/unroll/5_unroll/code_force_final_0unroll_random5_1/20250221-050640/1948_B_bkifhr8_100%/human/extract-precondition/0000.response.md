Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a` such that 2 <= n <= 50. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.**

However, the provided function definition is incomplete. It should be:
```
def func(a, n):
```
This function will then process the array `a` of length `n` to determine if it can be sorted in non-decreasing order using the specified operation.
