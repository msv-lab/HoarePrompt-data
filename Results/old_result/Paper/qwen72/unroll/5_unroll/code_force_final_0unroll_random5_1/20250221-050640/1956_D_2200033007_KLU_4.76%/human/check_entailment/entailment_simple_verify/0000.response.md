Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect because it only handles specific cases (arrays of length 2 and 3) and does not generalize to other lengths of arrays as required by the problem description. The program does not compute the MEX of any subarray, nor does it perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. Instead, it simply prints hardcoded values for arrays of length 2 and 3, and for all other lengths, it prints `13 0`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input array `[1, 100, 2, 1]` of length 4. The program will output `13 0`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `105 2` with the operations `3 3` and `3 4`, as shown in the problem description.

The annotations provided do not change this conclusion. They correctly describe the state of the program but do not address the fundamental issue that the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
