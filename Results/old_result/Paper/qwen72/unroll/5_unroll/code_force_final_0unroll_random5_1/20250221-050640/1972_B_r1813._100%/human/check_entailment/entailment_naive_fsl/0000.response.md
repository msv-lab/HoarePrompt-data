Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are no facing-up coins initially. According to the problem description, if there are no facing-up coins, the player loses. However, the program does not check for this condition. It only checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd or even, which is not sufficient to determine the winner in all cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5
DDDDD
```
The program will output "NO" because the number of 'U' coins is 0, which is even. However, since there are no facing-up coins, Alice should lose immediately, and the correct output should be "NO" for Alice and "YES" for Bob. The program does not account for this edge case, making it incorrect.
