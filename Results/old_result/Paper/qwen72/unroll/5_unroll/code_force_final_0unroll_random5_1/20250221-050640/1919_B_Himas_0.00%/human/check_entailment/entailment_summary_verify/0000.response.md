Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not implement the required logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints this difference, which is not the correct approach according to the problem description.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Split the array `a` into subarrays such that the sum of penalties of these subarrays is minimized.
2. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
3. The optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty is to split it into subarrays where the sum of each subarray is zero whenever possible, as this results in a penalty of zero for those subarrays.

The provided program does not perform any splitting and instead just calculates the overall difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
