The function should take a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of a corner of the square. The list will contain exactly four tuples, and each x_i and y_i will be an integer such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The coordinates will form a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
