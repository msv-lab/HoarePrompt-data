Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it only checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower). However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- If `n` is even, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must also be even because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves will always be even.
- If `n` is odd, the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must be odd for the same reason.

Therefore, the correct condition to check is whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If they do, it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves; otherwise, it is not.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This program checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is the correct condition to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
