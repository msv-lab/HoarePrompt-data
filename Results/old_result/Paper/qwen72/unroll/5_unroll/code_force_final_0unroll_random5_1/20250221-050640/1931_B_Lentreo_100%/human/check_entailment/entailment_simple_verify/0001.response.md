### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour any amount of water from container `i` to container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container after the operations will be the mean of the initial amounts, which is `mean = total // n`.
   - The key idea is to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means we cannot achieve the goal because we cannot pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the initial amounts of water in the containers `nums`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` with `nums` as the argument.
   - In `func_1`:
     - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. However, the problem guarantees that the sum is always divisible by `n`, so this check is redundant.
     - It calculates the mean amount of water.
     - It initializes a variable `curr` to track the cumulative difference.
     - It iterates through each container and updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current amount of water and the mean.
     - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
     - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Initial State**: `nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list.
   - **Inside `func_1`**:
     - `n = len(nums)`: `n` is the number of containers.
     - `total = sum(nums)`: `total` is the sum of the amounts of water in all containers.
     - `if total % n != 0`: This check is redundant because the problem guarantees that the sum is divisible by `n`.
     - `mean = total // n`: The mean amount of water each container should have.
     - `curr = 0`: Initialize the cumulative difference to 0.
     - `for i in range(n)`: Iterate through each container.
       - `curr += nums[i] - mean`: Update the cumulative difference.
       - `if curr < 0`: If the cumulative difference becomes negative, return 'NO'.
     - **Final State**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, return 'YES'.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the key idea of tracking the cumulative difference.
   - The function will return 'NO' if at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, which is the correct behavior.
   - The function will return 'YES' if the cumulative difference never becomes negative, which is also correct.
   - The redundant check `if total % n != 0` does not affect the correctness of the program because it will never be triggered given the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the annotations. The redundant check does not impact the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
