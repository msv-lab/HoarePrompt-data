Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the program for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
5
```

The program prints `5` instead of `2` because it does not correctly account for the possibility of performing the exchange operation to reduce the number of cards. The function `func_1` limits the frequency of any number to `k`, but it does not correctly handle the logic for performing the operations and minimizing the number of cards left. The correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to simulate the exchange operations and determine the minimum number of cards left.
