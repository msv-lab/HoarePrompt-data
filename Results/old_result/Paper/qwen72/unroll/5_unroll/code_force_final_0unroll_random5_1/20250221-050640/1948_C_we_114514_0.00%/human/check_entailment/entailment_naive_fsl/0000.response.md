Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical flaw in how it handles the movement of the robot. Specifically, the program does not correctly simulate the two-step movement process (first a manual move, then a move according to the arrow in the current cell). Instead, it only checks the direction of the arrows in a way that does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4
>><<
>>><
```
The robot starts at (1, 1). According to the problem description, the robot should move as follows:
1. Move right to (1, 2) (manual move).
2. Move right to (1, 3) (arrow move).
3. Move right to (1, 4) (manual move).
4. Move down to (2, 4) (arrow move).

However, the program does not correctly simulate this sequence of moves. It only checks the direction of the arrows and does not account for the manual move followed by the arrow move. This results in incorrect output for this test case. The program should return "YES" but it returns "NO" because it does not correctly handle the sequence of moves.
