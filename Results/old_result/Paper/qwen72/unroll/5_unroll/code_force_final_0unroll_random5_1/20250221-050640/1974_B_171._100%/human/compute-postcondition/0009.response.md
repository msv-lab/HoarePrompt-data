Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. In `decoded`, each character from `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in a reverse mapping defined by `char_map`. The `char_map` dictionary maps each unique character in `encoded` to the character at the opposite position in the sorted list of unique characters. The original `encoded` string and any intermediate variables used in the function remain unchanged. **
