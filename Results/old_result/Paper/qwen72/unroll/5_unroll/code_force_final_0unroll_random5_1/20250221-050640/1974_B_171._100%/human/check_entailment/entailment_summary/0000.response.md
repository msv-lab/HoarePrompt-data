Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using the specified algorithm. The algorithm for encoding involves creating a sorted list of unique characters from the original string and then mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in this list. To decode, the program must reverse this process.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters**: The program creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
   - **Mapping**: It constructs a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
   - **Decoding**: It then uses this dictionary to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the mapping.

3. **Output**: The program prints the decoded string for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` behaves as expected: it creates a reverse mapping of characters and applies this mapping to the encoded string to produce the decoded string.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
