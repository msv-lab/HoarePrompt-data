The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `password` of length `n` (1 <= n <= 20) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It returns 'NO' if any letter in the `password` is followed by a digit, or if the letters or digits in the `password` are not in non-decreasing order. If no such sequences or order issues are found, it returns 'YES'. The variable `n` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
