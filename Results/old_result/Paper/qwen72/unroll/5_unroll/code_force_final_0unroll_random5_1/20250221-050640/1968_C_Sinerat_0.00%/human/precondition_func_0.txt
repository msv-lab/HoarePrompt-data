The function `func` should accept a list of integers `x` where `1 <= len(x) <= 500` and `1 <= x_i <= 500` for all `2 <= i <= n`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 10^4`. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.
