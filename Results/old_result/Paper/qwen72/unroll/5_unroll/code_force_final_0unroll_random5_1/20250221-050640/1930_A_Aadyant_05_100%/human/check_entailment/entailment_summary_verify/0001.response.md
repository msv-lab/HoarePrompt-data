### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes a score `s` to 0 for each test case.
   - It reads the list of integers, converts them to integers, and sorts the list.
   - The program then iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller one due to sorting) to the score `s`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the final scores for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Sorting the List:**
  - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together. This is a crucial step because the goal is to maximize the score by always selecting the smaller of the two numbers in each pair.
  - By iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, the program effectively pairs the smallest elements and adds them to the score. This is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The algorithm is correct because it always pairs the smallest available elements, which ensures that the minimum values are added to the score. This is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly by selecting the minimum of the two numbers.
  - It also handles cases where all numbers are the same correctly by adding the same number `n` times.

- **Input/Output Format:**
  - The program correctly follows the input and output format specified in the problem description.

### Issues Found:

- **Redundant Variable Initialization:**
  - The variable `list1` is initialized but not used after the input is split and converted to integers. This is redundant and can be removed for cleaner code.

- **Potential Input Mismatch:**
  - The program reads the number of pairs `n` but does not use it to validate the length of the input list. This is not strictly necessary for the correctness of the algorithm but could be a good practice to ensure the input is as expected.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor issues noted, the program is functionally correct and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the score for each test case. The issues do not affect the correctness of the solution but could be improved for better code quality.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
