### Reasoning:

The given program is intended to solve a problem where we need to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting an array `a` derived from a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. However, the program does not implement the logic to calculate the minimum penalty as described in the problem statement. Instead, it simply calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and prints it.

Here are the key issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty:**
   - The program does not actually split the array `a` into subarrays and calculate the penalty for each subarray.
   - Instead, it calculates `P - M`, which is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. This is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.

2. **Output Mismatch:**
   - The output of the program is the difference `P - M`, which is not the correct output for the problem. The correct output should be the minimum possible penalty for the optimal split of the array `a`.

3. **Logic for Minimum Penalty:**
   - The correct approach to find the minimum penalty would involve splitting the array `a` in such a way that the sum of the penalties of the subarrays is minimized. This typically involves ensuring that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, or at least minimizing the absolute value of the sum of each subarray.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. This can be achieved by splitting the array at every transition from '+' to '-' or vice versa, which ensures that each subarray has a sum of zero or a minimal absolute value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Convert the string to an array of 1 and -1
        a = [1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in s]
        
        # Initialize the minimum penalty
        min_penalty = 0
        
        # Initialize the current sum
        current_sum = 0
        
        for value in a:
            current_sum += value
            min_penalty += abs(current_sum)
        
        print(min_penalty)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
- **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- **Array Conversion:** The string `s` is converted to an array `a` where each '+' is replaced by 1 and each '-' is replaced by -1.
- **Penalty Calculation:** The program iterates through the array `a`, maintaining a running sum `current_sum`. For each element, it adds the absolute value of the running sum to `min_penalty`. This ensures that the penalty is calculated based on the sum of the subarrays formed by the transitions in the array.
- **Output:** The minimum penalty for each test case is printed.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
