The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. `number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers with a length of at most 200, where all elements of `sequence` are in the range [-10^9; 10^9]. The function always returns the tuple (0, 0).

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `number` and a list of integers `sequence`. It always returns the tuple (0, 0).**
