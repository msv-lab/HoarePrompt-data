Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing two lists of integers `a` and `c` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in `a` equal by either increasing or decreasing elements in `a` using elements from `c`. If all elements in `a` and `c` are already equal, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
