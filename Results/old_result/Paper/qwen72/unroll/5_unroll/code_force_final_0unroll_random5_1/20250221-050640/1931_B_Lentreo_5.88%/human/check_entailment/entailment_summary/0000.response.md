Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element of `nums` is zero. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from one container to another.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if the average amount of water (which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers) can be achieved by pouring water from any container to any other container with a higher index. The key insight is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by repeatedly pouring water from containers with more than the average to containers with less than the average, as long as the pouring operation is allowed (i.e., from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index).

The provided program does not implement this logic. Instead, it calculates the sum of the differences between each non-zero element and the last element, which is not a valid way to determine the solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
