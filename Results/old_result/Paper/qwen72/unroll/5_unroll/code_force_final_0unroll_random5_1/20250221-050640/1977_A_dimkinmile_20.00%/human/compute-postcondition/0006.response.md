The function `func_1` is described with constraints and relationships that indicate it should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers with the condition that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, it should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer with the condition that 1 <= t <= 100. However, the provided function signature does not include these parameters, which makes it impossible to accurately describe the functionality based on the given information. Assuming the function signature is meant to include these parameters, here is the description:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases, a positive integer where 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers where 1 <= n, m <= 100. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
