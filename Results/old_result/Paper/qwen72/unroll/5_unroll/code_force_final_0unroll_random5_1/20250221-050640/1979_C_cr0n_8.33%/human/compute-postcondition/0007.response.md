Postcondition: **`prod` is the product of all integers in the list `vals`. `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `prod` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`. `den` is `prod` minus the sum of all elements in `vprod`, and the current value of `den` is less than or equal to 0. The values of `t`, `N`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.**
