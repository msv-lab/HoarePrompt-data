Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `w` of `n` integers. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, the function calculates and prints the number of unique combinations of three elements from the list `w` that are the same. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the program state with `t` and `n` as input integers, `w` as a list of integers, and `buffer` as an empty list. **
