Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise -1.**

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` updates the value of `arr` to a new list of integers representing a permutation of size `n` as returned by the function `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain as they were assigned by `func_1()`, and `pos` still represents the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present, otherwise -1.
