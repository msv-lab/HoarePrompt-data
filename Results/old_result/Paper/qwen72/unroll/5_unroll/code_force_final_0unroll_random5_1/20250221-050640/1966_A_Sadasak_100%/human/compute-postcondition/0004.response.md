Output State: **The program returns the `frequency_table` dictionary, where each key is an integer from the list `arr`, and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, but no value exceeds `k`. If an integer appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its frequency in `frequency_table` is capped at `k`. The length of `arr` and the value of `k` remain unchanged.**
