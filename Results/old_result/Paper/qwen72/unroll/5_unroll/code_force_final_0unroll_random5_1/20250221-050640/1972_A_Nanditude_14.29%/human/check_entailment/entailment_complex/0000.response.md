Reasoning:  
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through both arrays `a` and `b` simultaneously using two pointers `i` and `j`. The goal is to ensure that for every index `i`, `a[i]` is less than or equal to `b[i]`. If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it means the current difficulty in `a` is too high, and a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` needs to be proposed. The program then inserts `b[j]` into `a` at the appropriate position to maintain the non-decreasing order and removes the last element of `a` to keep the length of `a` consistent with `b`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Insertion and Deletion Logic**: The program uses `a.pop(-1)` to remove the last element of `a` and `a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]` to insert `b[j]` into `a` at the position `i`. This approach is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results because it does not maintain the non-decreasing order of `a` correctly. Instead, the program should use a more efficient method to insert the new problem and maintain the sorted order.

2. **Pointer Movement**: The program increments both `i` and `j` when `b[j]` is not less than `a[i]`. This can lead to incorrect results because it assumes that `a[i]` is already in the correct position, which may not be true if a new problem has been inserted.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is not used in the program and seems to be irrelevant to the problem. It sorts the entire list `arr` in reverse order, which is not necessary for solving the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for inserting new problems and maintaining the sorted order of `a` is flawed, and the function `func_1` is unnecessary.

Correctness: **False**
