The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers with specific ranges. The function is expected to return a result based on these inputs.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function likely processes each test case and returns a result for each case. However, since the specific output is not provided, we can only infer that the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30, and returns a result based on these inputs.**
