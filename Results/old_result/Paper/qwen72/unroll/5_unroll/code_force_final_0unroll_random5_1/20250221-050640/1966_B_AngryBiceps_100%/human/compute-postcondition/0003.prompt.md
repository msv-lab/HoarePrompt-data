You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 500, and the grid is a list of n strings, each of length m, containing characters 'W' and 'B'.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = []
        
        first_row = ''
        
        last_row = ''
        
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)
            ) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n` and `m` from input, constructs a grid `a` of `n` strings each of length `m`, and checks certain conditions on the grid. After all iterations, `t` is unchanged, and `n`, `m`, and `a` are not retained between iterations. The variables `first_row` and `last_row` are reset for each iteration. The output state is the same as the initial state, except that the loop has been executed `t` times, and the program has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each grid based on the conditions checked.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t`, integers `n` and `m`, and a list `grid` of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns a result based on the input grid and the integer `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
