The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `n` is even) and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of a grid, respectively. The function returns a list `results` where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the second row is reachable from the first row for each test case in the list `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' if the second row is reachable from the first row, or 'NO' otherwise, for each test case.**
