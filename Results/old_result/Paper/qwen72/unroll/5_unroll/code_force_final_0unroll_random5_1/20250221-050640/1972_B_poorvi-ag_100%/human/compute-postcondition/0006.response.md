The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from stdin. The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which represents the number of test cases. Each test case is defined by two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string `s` of length `n`, where each character is either "U" or "D", representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).

The function processes each test case and returns the number of coins that need to be flipped to make all coins face the same direction (either all "U" or all "D").

Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from stdin, where each test case includes the number of coins and their states. It returns the minimum number of flips required to make all coins face the same direction for each test case.**
