To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the variable `t`.

1. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop to iterate over the range of `t`. It does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically managed by the loop.
2. The variable `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
