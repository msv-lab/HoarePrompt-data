The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters, likely in the form of a list or tuple of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints are as follows: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the example. Assuming the function returns a result for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
