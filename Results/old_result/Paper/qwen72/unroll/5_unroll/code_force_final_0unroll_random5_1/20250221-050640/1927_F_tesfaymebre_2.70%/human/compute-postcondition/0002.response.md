Output State: **`test_cases` is a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases.** 

The loop iterates `test_cases` times, and each iteration calls `func_6()`. Since the loop does not modify `test_cases` or any other variables, the state of `test_cases` remains unchanged after the loop completes. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
