To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1` does. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, I'll assume a common operation for such a function, such as multiplication, which is a reasonable assumption given the context of multipliers.

Given:
- `numbers` is a list of integers where each integer \( k_i \) is between 2 and 20.
- `result` is initialized to the first integer in the `numbers` list.

The loop:
```python
for num in numbers[1:]:
    result = func_1(result, num)
```

Assuming `func_1` is a multiplication function, the loop will multiply all the integers in the `numbers` list together, starting with the first integer.

### Initial State:
- `numbers` is a list of integers.
- `result` is equal to the first integer in the `numbers` list.

### Output State:
- `result` will be the product of all integers in the `numbers` list.
- `numbers` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`result` is the product of all integers in the `numbers` list, and `numbers` remains unchanged.**
