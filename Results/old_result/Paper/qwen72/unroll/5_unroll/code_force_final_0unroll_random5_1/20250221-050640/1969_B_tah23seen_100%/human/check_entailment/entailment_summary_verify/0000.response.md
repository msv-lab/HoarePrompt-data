### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted, and provides an example where the input string is "1111" and the function returns 4, which is incorrect. However, this assessment is based on a misunderstanding of the problem and the function's logic.

Let's break down the function `func_1` to understand its behavior:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - `one` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop through the string:**
   - For each character `i` in the string `s`:
     - If `i` is '1', increment `one` by 1.
     - If `i` is '0' and `one` is greater than 0, add `one + 1` to `cost`.

3. **Return the cost:**
   - The function returns the total `cost`.

### Analysis:

- **Case 1: String is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"):**
  - For "0000":
    - The loop will iterate through all '0's, but since `one` is always 0, no cost is added.
    - The final `cost` is 0, which is correct.
  - For "1111":
    - The loop will iterate through all '1's, incrementing `one` to 4.
    - There are no '0's, so no cost is added.
    - The final `cost` is 0, which is correct.

- **Case 2: String is not sorted (e.g., "10", "11000", "101011", "01101001"):**
  - For "10":
    - `one` is incremented to 1 when the first '1' is encountered.
    - When the '0' is encountered, `one` is 1, so `cost` is incremented by `1 + 1 = 2`.
    - The final `cost` is 2, which is correct.
  - For "11000":
    - `one` is incremented to 2 when the first two '1's are encountered.
    - When the first '0' is encountered, `one` is 2, so `cost` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - When the second '0' is encountered, `one` is still 2, so `cost` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - When the third '0' is encountered, `one` is still 2, so `cost` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - The final `cost` is 9, which is correct.
  - For "101011":
    - `one` is incremented to 1 when the first '1' is encountered.
    - When the first '0' is encountered, `one` is 1, so `cost` is incremented by `1 + 1 = 2`.
    - `one` is incremented to 2 when the second '1' is encountered.
    - When the second '0' is encountered, `one` is 2, so `cost` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - `one` is incremented to 3 when the third '1' is encountered.
    - When the third '0' is encountered, `one` is 3, so `cost` is incremented by `3 + 1 = 4`.
    - The final `cost` is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9, which is correct.
  - For "01101001":
    - `one` is incremented to 1 when the first '1' is encountered.
    - When the first '0' is encountered, `one` is 1, so `cost` is incremented by `1 + 1 = 2`.
    - `one` is incremented to 2 when the second '1' is encountered.
    - When the second '0' is encountered, `one` is 2, so `cost` is incremented by `2 + 1 = 3`.
    - `one` is incremented to 3 when the third '1' is encountered.
    - When the third '0' is encountered, `one` is 3, so `cost` is incremented by `3 + 1 = 4`.
    - When the fourth '0' is encountered, `one` is still 3, so `cost` is incremented by `3 + 1 = 4`.
    - The final `cost` is 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 13, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be 11.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted and returns 0. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the string is not sorted and contains multiple '0's after '1's. The example "01101001" shows that the function calculates the cost incorrectly, as it should be 11 but the function returns 13.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
