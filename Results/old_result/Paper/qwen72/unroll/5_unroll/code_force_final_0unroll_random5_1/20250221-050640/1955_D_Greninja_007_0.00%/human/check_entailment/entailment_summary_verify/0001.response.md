Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case. It also reads the arrays `a` and `b` and passes them to the function `func_1`. This part of the program is accurate.

2. **Frequency Counters**: The program uses the `Counter` class to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements). This is a good approach because it allows efficient counting and comparison of elements. The `Counter` objects `b_freq` and `window_freq` are initialized correctly.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation**: The initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and `b` is calculated using a generator expression inside the `sum` function. This correctly counts the minimum number of common elements between the two frequency counters. The logic here is sound.

4. **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` from the second element to the `(n-m+1)`-th element. For each new position of the window:
   - It checks if the current number of matches is at least `k`. If so, it increments the `good_subarrays` counter.
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`).
   - It updates the frequency counter for the element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`).
   - It adjusts the `matches` count accordingly.

   The sliding window logic is implemented correctly. The program maintains the frequency counts and the `matches` variable efficiently by only updating the counts for the elements that are added to and removed from the window.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program performs one last check to see if the final window is good. This is necessary because the loop only checks up to the second-to-last window. The final check ensures that the last window is also considered, which is correct.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of good subarrays for each test case. The output is generated correctly for each test case.

The function summary provided is accurate and aligns with the implementation of `func_1`. The function correctly counts the number of good subarrays by maintaining frequency counters and a sliding window, and it handles the problem constraints efficiently.

Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct. The use of the `Counter` class and the sliding window technique ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient, and the logic is implemented correctly.
