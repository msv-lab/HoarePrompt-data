Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves a list of integers `x`. For each test case, it generates a new list `a` where the first element is always 500, and each subsequent element is the cumulative sum of the elements from the input list `x` up to that index. The function prints the list `a` for each test case. The input variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged, and the variables `n` and `a` are reset for each new test case. **
