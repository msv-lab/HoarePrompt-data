You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]

        print(outputs)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of 2n integers, and n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The integers in each test case are positive and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. The function should also handle up to t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.

    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        
        list1 = []
        
        a = input()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = input('')
        
        list1 = b.split()

            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        
        out.append(sum(list2))
        
        del list1[:]
        
        del list2[:]
        
    #State: `out` is a list containing the sum of the selected elements from each test case, and `list1` and `list2` are empty lists.
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
        
    #State: The `out` list remains unchanged, and `list1` and `list2` are still empty lists.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Reading Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of pairs to be chosen.
   - It then reads a line of `2n` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available number in each pair.

4. **Selecting Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects every second element (starting from the first element) to add to `list2`. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and selecting every second element ensures that we are always choosing the smaller number in each pair.

5. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the elements in `list2`, which represents the maximum score for the current test case.
   - It appends this sum to the `out` list.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the `out` list and prints each score.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are chosen first, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
  - The program correctly sums the selected elements and prints the results.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case of a single test case and multiple test cases.
  - It also handles the edge case where all elements are the same (as in the third test case).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 100 elements per test case, and up to 5000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the optimal strategy to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
