Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program first reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`.

3. **Calculating Operations**:
   - `cats_to_add` is calculated as the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'. This represents the number of cats that need to be added to the boxes.
   - `cats_to_remove` is calculated as the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. This represents the number of cats that need to be removed from the boxes.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because the operations of adding and removing cats are independent, and the total number of days required will be the maximum of these two values.

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n, s1, s2)`, which is the minimum number of operations required.

The logic and implementation are correct and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
