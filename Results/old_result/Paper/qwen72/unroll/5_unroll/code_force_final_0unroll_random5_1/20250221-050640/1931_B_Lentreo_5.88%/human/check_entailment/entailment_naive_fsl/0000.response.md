Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations. Specifically, the logic in the program is flawed:

1. The program calculates the difference between each element in the list and the last element (`last = nums[-1]`), and sums these differences in `curr`.
2. It then checks if `curr` is zero to decide the output.

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the average amount of water that each container should have after the operations. The correct approach should involve calculating the average amount of water (`sum(nums) // n`) and checking if it is possible to redistribute the water such that each container has this average amount.

### Counterexample:
Consider the test case:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
- The sum of the water amounts is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and `n = 3`.
- The average amount of water each container should have is `6 // 3 = 2`.

The correct answer should be "YES" because it is possible to redistribute the water to make each container have 2 units of water:
- Pour 1 unit from the third container to the first container: `1 2 2` -> `2 2 2`.

However, the program will output "NO" because it calculates `curr` as follows:
- `last = 3`
- `curr = (1 - 3) + (2 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -2 + -1 + 0 = -3`
- Since `curr` is not zero, the program outputs "NO".

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
