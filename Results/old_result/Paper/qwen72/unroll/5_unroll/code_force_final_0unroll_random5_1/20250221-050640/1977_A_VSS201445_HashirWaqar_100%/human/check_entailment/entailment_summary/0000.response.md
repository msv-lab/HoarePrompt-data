Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move is either adding or removing one cube from the top of the tower. The key insight is that each move can either add or remove one cube, so the number of cubes in the tower can only change by 1 per move. Therefore, after `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower must be `n` minus some even number (since adding and removing a cube twice cancels out).

The conditions for the program to print 'YES' are:
1. `n` must be greater than or equal to `m` (because you can't have more cubes than the number of moves).
2. The difference `(n - m)` must be even (because each pair of add/remove operations cancels out, and the net effect must be an even number of operations to reach exactly `m` cubes).

The provided program correctly implements these conditions:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.
- If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing each test case and printing the correct output based on the conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
