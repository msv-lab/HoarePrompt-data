Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by determining the MEX of the final array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. However, the program's logic does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for both players. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good start for finding the MEX.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `M` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each element in `N`.

3. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates `cur` and `M` accordingly.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, which is incorrect because it doesn't handle the optimal play correctly.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the frequencies in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1, which is not the correct way to determine the MEX.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` that have a frequency of 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

The program's logic for determining the MEX is flawed. The correct approach should involve both players playing optimally to either maximize or minimize the MEX. Specifically, Alice and Bob should focus on the smallest missing non-negative integer and the elements that can affect it.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sort the array `N` to facilitate finding the MEX.

2. **Track the MEX**:
   - Initialize `cur` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted array and check if the current element is equal to `cur`. If it is, increment `cur`.
   - If the current element is greater than `cur`, break the loop because `cur` is the MEX.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally to either maximize or minimize the MEX. Alice will always choose the smallest available element that is not already in `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will choose the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.
   - The key is to ensure that Alice can always choose the smallest missing element, and Bob will try to prevent this.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = 0
        for num in N:
            if num == cur:
                cur += 1
            elif num > cur:
                break
        if cur % 2 == 0:
            print(cur)
        else:
            print(cur - 1)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted to facilitate the MEX calculation.
- **MEX Calculation**: We initialize `cur` to 0 and iterate through the sorted array. If the current element is equal to `cur`, we increment `cur`. If the current element is greater than `cur`, we break the loop because `cur` is the MEX.
- **Optimal Play**: Since Alice and Bob play optimally, if `cur` is even, Alice can ensure that the MEX is `cur` by always choosing the smallest available element. If `cur` is odd, Bob can ensure that the MEX is `cur - 1` by preventing Alice from choosing the smallest available element.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy for both Alice and Bob. The corrected program above should work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
