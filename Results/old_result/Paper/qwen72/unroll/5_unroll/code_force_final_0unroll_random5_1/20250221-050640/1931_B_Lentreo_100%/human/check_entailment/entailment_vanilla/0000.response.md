### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - If the sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `mean = total // n`.
   - To achieve this, the total amount of water poured into the containers from the left must always be non-negative. This is because we can only pour water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Step 1**: Calculate the total amount of water and the mean amount of water per container.
   - **Step 2**: Initialize a variable `curr` to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - **Step 3**: Iterate through each container and update `curr` by adding the difference between the current container's water and the mean.
   - **Step 4**: If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that the water cannot be evenly distributed without violating the condition `i < j`. In this case, return 'NO'.
   - **Step 5**: If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, return 'YES'.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the mean and iterates through the containers to check the cumulative difference.
   - The condition `if total % n != 0` is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
   - The logic inside the loop is correct: it checks if the cumulative difference ever becomes negative, which would indicate that it is impossible to achieve the target distribution.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Container**: If `n = 1`, the function will correctly return 'YES' because the single container already has the mean amount of water.
   - **Equal Distribution**: If all containers already have the same amount of water, the function will correctly return 'YES'.
   - **Imbalanced Distribution**: If the distribution is such that `curr` becomes negative at any point, the function will correctly return 'NO'.
