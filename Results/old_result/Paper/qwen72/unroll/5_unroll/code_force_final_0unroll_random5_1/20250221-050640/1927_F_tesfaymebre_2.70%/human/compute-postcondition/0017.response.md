Functionality: ** The function `func_6` constructs a graph and processes it using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. It initializes the graph and a list of edges based on the output of `func_3`. After sorting the edges in descending order by weight, it uses the DSU to unionize nodes and track the minimum edge weight that was part of a union operation. The function then performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node that was last unionized with the minimum edge weight and prints the minimum edge weight and the number of nodes in the connected component. It also prints the nodes in the path or cycle starting from the specified node. The function does not return any values. **
