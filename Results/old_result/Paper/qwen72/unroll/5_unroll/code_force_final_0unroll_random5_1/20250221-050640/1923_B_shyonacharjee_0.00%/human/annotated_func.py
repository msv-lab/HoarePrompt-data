#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains: `n` (an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of monsters), `k` (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9, representing the number of bullets you can fire per second), `a` (a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the health of each monster), and `x` (a list of n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, representing the initial positions of the monsters). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        
        total_bullets_used = 0
        
        success = True
        
        for i in range(n):
            position, health = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged, `test_cases` is unchanged, `monsters` is a sorted list of tuples based on the absolute value of positions, `total_bullets_used` is the total number of bullets used for the last test case, and `success` is a boolean indicating whether it was possible to defeat all monsters in the last test case. The loop prints 'YES' if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves a set of monsters with given health and initial positions. The function determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters in each test case by firing bullets at them. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the time constraints, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the `test_cases` list (if it exists) is not modified. The function sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions and calculates the total number of bullets needed to defeat them, checking if this is feasible within the time available.
