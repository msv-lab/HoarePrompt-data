The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the areas of all the squares have been printed, and the variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`, and `res` are in their final states corresponding to the last test case. The variable `a` (which is `t`) remains unchanged.
