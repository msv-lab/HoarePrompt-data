### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move.
   - After \( n \) moves, the tower should have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The key observation is that each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of cubes (0) and the final number of cubes (\( m \)) must be an even number if Nikita can achieve it in \( n \) moves.

2. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The number of moves \( n \) must be at least as large as the number of cubes \( m \) because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he has made.
   - The difference \( n - m \) must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes, the total number of moves must be such that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes added and removed balances out to an even difference.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if the difference \( n - m \) is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification**:
   - The condition \( n \ge m \) ensures that there are enough moves to potentially build a tower of height \( m \).
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the tower to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 3 \):
     - \( n \ge m \) is true.
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) is true.
     - Output: "YES" (Correct).
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \):
     - \( n \ge m \) is false.
     - Output: "NO" (Correct).
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \):
     - \( n \ge m \) is true.
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) is true.
     - Output: "YES" (Correct).

### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func` correctly processes the input and checks the conditions as described.
- It reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
- For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \), and checks if \( n \ge m \) and if \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \).
- If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. The conditions and the logic are sound and match the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
