### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can change the beauty value.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the array.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - **Sorting the Array:**
     - Sorting the array ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
   - **Calculating the Beauty:**
     - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
     - This approach is correct because the maximum beauty is achieved by maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative differences. By pairing the largest and smallest elements, the program ensures that the differences are maximized.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., the second test case with all elements being 69). In this case, the beauty is 0, which is correct.
     - The program also handles the case where the array length is even or odd correctly. For odd lengths, the middle element is not considered in the differences, which is appropriate.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated beauty for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

5. **Verification with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code confirms that the program sorts the array and then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.
   - The state of the program at key points is consistent with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the appropriate differences. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

### Final:
**True**
