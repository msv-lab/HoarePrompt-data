### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then processes each test case by reading `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(test_cases)` is correctly defined and initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`. This is a correct approach to group sticks by their lengths.

4. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0 and `total_count` to 0.
   - For each unique exponent `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these `cnt` sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) and adds this to `res`. This is correct.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these `cnt` sticks and one stick from the previously processed sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplies it by `total_count`. This is also correct.
     - It updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

5. **Triangle Inequality:**
   - The program correctly handles the triangle inequality theorem. For sticks of lengths \(2^a\), \(2^b\), and \(2^c\) (where \(a \le b \le c\)), a non-degenerate triangle can only be formed if \(a = b = c\). This is because \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) is only true when \(a = b = c\). The program only counts combinations of sticks with the same length, which is the correct approach.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when there are fewer than 3 sticks or when all sticks have different lengths. In these cases, the number of valid triangles is 0, which is the expected output.

### Annotated Code Validation:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The state before the function call is correctly described: `test_cases` is an integer representing the number of test cases.

- **State Inside Function:**
  - The state inside the function is also correctly described: `results` is a list that will store the results for each test case, and `n` and `num_list` are correctly read for each test case.

- **State After Processing Each Test Case:**
  - The state after processing each test case is correctly described: `res` contains the number of valid triangles for the current test case, and `total_count` is updated correctly.

- **State After All Test Cases:**
  - The state after all test cases is correctly described: `results` is a list containing the number of valid triangles for each test case, and each element in `results` is printed to the console.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
