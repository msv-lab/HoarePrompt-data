Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

The program will output:
```
2
2
2
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
2
3
2
```

The program fails to correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed for the second test case. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks for a specific pattern (`l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if it finds such a pattern. This pattern is not a general solution to the problem, and it does not handle all possible configurations of best friends. For the second test case, the correct minimum number of invitations is `3`, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.
