Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the array. It then reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, and converts each string to an integer before appending it to the list `a`. This part of the code is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is a valid function call.

3. **Function Definition and Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function.
   - If `c` (the length of the array) is 2, it prints the output `4 1` followed by `1 2`. This is the correct output for the specific case where the array has exactly two elements, as shown in the first example.
   - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the sum of the elements of the array will always be 13 and no operations are needed, which is not true for all possible inputs. The correct approach should consider the actual elements of the array and compute the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

4. **Output**:
   - The program only handles the case where the array length is 2 correctly.
   - For all other lengths, it incorrectly outputs `13 0`, which is not a valid solution for the problem.

5. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of length other than 2.
   - It does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array.

Given the above points, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the general case and does not follow the required logic to solve the problem for arrays of any length.

Final: **False**
