Output State: The function will print the time in 12-hour format followed by AM or PM for each test case. After all iterations of the loop have finished, the variables `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be in their final state corresponding to the last test case processed. The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. The final values of `h`, `m`, `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be the values from the last input time processed. All other variables not mentioned in the loop head and body will remain unchanged.
