The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `ones` and `sum` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0, and `_` will start at 0 (though it is not used in the loop body).

State: **`ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` and 1, `_` is 0, `q` must be greater than 0**
