You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
t = 1
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of integers `a` representing the lengths of the sticks, and an integer `n` representing the number of sticks, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers representing the lengths of the sticks (input by the user), `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `ans` is 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a unique length from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that length appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3
        
    #State: `ans` is the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the dictionary `cnt` remains the same as in the initial state.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the total number of groups of 3 sticks that can be formed from the counts of each unique stick length in the list `a`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of sticks of a particular length is not a multiple of 3 but is greater than 3. For example, if there are 5 sticks of the same length, the program will only count 1 polygon (since 5 // 3 = 1), but it should count 1 polygon and leave 2 sticks unused, which could potentially be used to form another polygon if there are other sticks of the same length available. 

Consider the following input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The expected output is 2, as you can form two hexagons (6-sided polygons) with the 6 sticks of length 2. However, the program will output 4, as it counts each group of 3 sticks as a separate polygon, which is incorrect because a hexagon requires 6 sticks. 

This indicates that the program's logic for counting the maximum number of polygons is flawed. It should be counting the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with the available sticks, not just the number of groups of 3 sticks.
