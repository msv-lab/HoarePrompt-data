You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. After processing these inputs, it will print 'YES' if the conditions for `match_a_b` and `match_c` are met, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `template`, `match_a_b`, and `match_c` will be reset for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `t` by iterating over each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, it appends the lowercase character `a[i]` to the template.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, it appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - **Matching `a` and `b` with the template:**
     - The program checks if `a` and `b` match the template.
     - For each character in the template:
       - If the character is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
       - If the character is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - **Matching `c` with the template:**
     - The program checks if `c` does not match the template.
     - For each character in the template:
       - If the character is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` is different from the template character.
       - If the character is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` is the same as the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The template construction logic is flawed. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the program appends the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template. This is not always correct because the template should be constructed in a way that both `a` and `b` can match it, and `c` cannot.
  - A correct template should be constructed by ensuring that for each position `i`:
    - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should have the same lowercase character.
    - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template should have an uppercase character that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template is correct.
  - The logic for checking if `c` does not match the template is also correct.

### Correctness:
- The program's template construction logic is incorrect, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases.
- For example, in the case where `a = "acc"`, `b = "abd"`, and `c = "abc"`, the program will construct the template as `"aCd"`, which is incorrect because `c` matches the template.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
