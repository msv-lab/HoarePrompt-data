Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-negative integer `t` representing the current time step in the game. It identifies players whose values in the `player` dictionary match `blud` and collects their keys into a list `out`. The function then sets the values of these identified players in the `player` dictionary to `[-1, -1]`. Finally, it prints the time step `t`, the player key, and the string 'ELIMINATED' for each player in the sorted `out` list. The function does not return any value. **
