Reasoning:
The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle all cases correctly. The program checks if the cumulative difference from the mean is ever negative, which is indeed a necessary but not sufficient condition for the problem. However, the counterexample provided in the original assessment is not accurate for the given problem constraints. 

Let's re-evaluate the program with a correct understanding of the problem constraints and the logic:

1. **Problem Constraints**:
   - The sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers, \( n \).
   - We can pour water from any container \( i \) to any container \( j \) where \( i < j \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have.
   - It then iterates through the containers, maintaining a cumulative difference `curr` from the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The key insight is that if the sum of the water is divisible by \( n \), and we can pour water from any lower-indexed container to any higher-indexed container, the only way the distribution cannot be made equal is if there is a point where the cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative.
   - This is because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that the amount of water in the containers up to that point is less than what it should be to reach the mean, and there is no way to compensate for this deficit using the allowed operations (since we can only pour from lower to higher indices).

4. **Revised Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     n = 4
     nums = [1, 2, 3, 6]
     ```
   - The total sum is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12 \), which is divisible by 4.
   - The mean is \( 12 // 4 = 3 \).

   - The program will output:
     ```
     NO
     ```
   - This is correct because the cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative:
     - After the first container: `curr = 1 - 3 = -2` (negative, so return 'NO').

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is sound and correctly identifies whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.
   - The original assessment's counterexample is incorrect, but the program's logic is still valid for the given problem constraints.

Final: **True**

The program is correct for the given problem description and constraints.
