The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_j <= 10^9 for each j from 1 to n, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
