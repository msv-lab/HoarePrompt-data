The function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and writes the results to standard output. Each test case involves a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` contains exactly `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, the function calculates the last year when all signs in the list `a` align based on their periodicities and appends this year as a string to a results list. After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to standard output, with each result on a new line.
