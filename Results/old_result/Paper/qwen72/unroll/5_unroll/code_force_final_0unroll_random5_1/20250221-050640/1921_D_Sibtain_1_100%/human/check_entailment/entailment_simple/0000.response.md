### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `c`.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The function checks if all elements in `a` and `c` are the same and equal to each other. If so, it prints `0` because the maximum difference is zero when all elements are identical.
   - This is a valid check and correctly handles the case where the arrays are identical.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The list `c` is sorted in descending order.
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order ensures that the elements are as far apart as possible, which is a good strategy to maximize the absolute differences.

4. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `a` has only one element, the function calculates the maximum difference between this element and the largest or smallest element in `c`.
   - This is a valid approach because the maximum difference for a single element is indeed the difference between it and the extreme values in `c`.

5. **General Case:**
   - For the general case, the function uses two pointers `i` and `j` to iterate through the sorted lists `a` and `c`.
   - It calculates the absolute differences `t1` and `t2` between the current elements of `a` and `c` and updates the pointers based on which difference is larger.
   - The variable `ans` accumulates the maximum differences.
   - This approach ensures that the differences are maximized by always choosing the largest possible difference at each step.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the accumulated maximum difference `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the special case where all elements are identical.
- The sorting strategy is appropriate for maximizing the differences.
- The use of two pointers to iterate through the sorted lists and accumulate the maximum differences is a valid and efficient approach.
- The program processes all test cases and prints the required output for each.
