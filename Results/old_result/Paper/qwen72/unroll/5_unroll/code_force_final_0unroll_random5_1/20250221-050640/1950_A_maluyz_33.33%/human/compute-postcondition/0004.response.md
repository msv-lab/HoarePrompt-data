Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the user input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input, where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`. After processing each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a <= b >= c` and `b` is the maximum, or 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained after each test case. The variable `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes. **
