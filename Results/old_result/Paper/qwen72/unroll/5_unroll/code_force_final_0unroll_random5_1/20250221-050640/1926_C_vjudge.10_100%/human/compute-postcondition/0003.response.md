The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `inf`. The loop will execute if `inf` is greater than 1, because `range(1, inf)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `inf`. For the loop to execute at least once, `inf` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` will start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).
- `inf` is 200001 (which is greater than 1, so the loop will execute).
- `values` is a list of 200001 zeros (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `inf` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros, `i` is 1, `inf` must be greater than 1**
