Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last character of the alphabet ('z') and moving backwards. The characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the first character in this sorted order is mapped to the last available letter in the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on, until all unique characters are mapped. The length of `b` remains unchanged, and `b` itself is not modified.**
