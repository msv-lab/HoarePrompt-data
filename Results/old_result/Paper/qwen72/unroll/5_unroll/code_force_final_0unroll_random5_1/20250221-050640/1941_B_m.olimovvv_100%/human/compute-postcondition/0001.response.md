Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the list `b` such that after the inner loop completes, the elements at indices `a-1` and `a-2` of `b` are checked. If both `b[a-1]` and `b[a-2]` are zero, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a` remain unchanged.**
