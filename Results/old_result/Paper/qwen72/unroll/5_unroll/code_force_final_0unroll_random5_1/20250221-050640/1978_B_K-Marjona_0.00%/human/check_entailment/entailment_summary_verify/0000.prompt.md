You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) from the input. The function then calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`. Otherwise, it prints a value calculated using the formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b > a` and `k = min(n, b - a)` correctly. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the profit for the first `k` buns is incorrect. The formula `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k` is meant to calculate the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence, but it is missing the correct adjustment for the sequence. The correct formula should be:

\[
\text{profit} = \left( \frac{k \times (b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \right) + (n - k) \times a
\]

However, the program uses:

\[
\text{profit} = \left( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \right) \times k + (n - k) \times a
\]

This can lead to incorrect results. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4 4 5
```

The expected output is 17, but the program outputs 18. This is because the formula used in the program incorrectly calculates the sum of the first `k` buns. The correct calculation should be:

\[
\text{profit} = \left( \frac{1 \times (5 + (5 - 1 + 1))}{2} \right) + 3 \times 4 = \left( \frac{1 \times 10}{2} \right) + 12 = 5 + 12 = 17
\]

But the program calculates:

\[
\text{profit} = \left( \frac{(5 + (5 - 1 + 1))}{2} \right) \times 1 + 3 \times 4 = \left( \frac{10}{2} \right) \times 1 + 12 = 5 \times 1 + 12 = 17
\]

This is a specific case where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
