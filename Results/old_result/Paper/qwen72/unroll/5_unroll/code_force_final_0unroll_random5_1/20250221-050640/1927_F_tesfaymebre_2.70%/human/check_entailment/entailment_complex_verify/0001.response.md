### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly uses `func_1`, `func_3`, and `func_4` to read the number of test cases, the graph size, and the edges. These functions are efficient and appropriate for the given problem.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - The graph is constructed using a `defaultdict` of lists, where each vertex is mapped to a list of its neighbors. This is a common and efficient way to represent a graph in Python.

3. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights. This is done to ensure that the heaviest edges are considered first, which is a key part of the algorithm to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - The DSU class is correctly implemented to manage the connected components of the graph. It includes methods to find the root of a set and to union two sets while keeping track of the minimum edge weight in each component.

5. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the two vertices of an edge are already in the same component), it updates the minimum edge weight and the nodes involved in the cycle. However, the original assessment correctly points out that the line `dsu.union(u, v, w)` should not be called if `parent_u == parent_v` because it would incorrectly union the sets and potentially overwrite the minimum edge weight.

6. **DFS for Cycle Path:**
   - The `dfs` function is used to find the actual path of the cycle. It uses a `colors` array to keep track of the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited). The original assessment correctly identifies that the current implementation does not handle the path construction correctly and may return an incomplete or incorrect path.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum weight of the edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle. It then prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order. However, the original assessment correctly points out that the `dfs` function should ensure that the path is constructed correctly and that it includes all nodes in the cycle.

### Issues in the Original Program:
1. **Incorrect Cycle Detection in DSU:**
   - The line `dsu.union(u, v, w)` is called even when `parent_u == parent_v`, which is incorrect. This should be avoided to prevent overwriting the minimum edge weight.

2. **DFS Path Return:**
   - The `dfs` function does not correctly handle the cycle path construction. It should return the path starting from the first occurrence of the cycle and ending at the current node. The current implementation may return an incomplete or incorrect path.

3. **Cycle Path Construction:**
   - The `dfs` function should ensure that the path is constructed correctly and that it includes all nodes in the cycle. The original implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Corrected Program:
The corrected program addresses the issues identified in the original assessment. It correctly handles cycle detection and path construction.

### Correctness:
The original program is indeed incorrect due to the issues in cycle detection and path construction. The corrected program, as provided in the original assessment, should correctly find and print the simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

Final: **False**
