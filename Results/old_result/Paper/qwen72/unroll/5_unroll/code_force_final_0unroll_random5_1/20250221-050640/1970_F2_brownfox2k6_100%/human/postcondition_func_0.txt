The function `func_1` accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing coordinates and a string `d` representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). It modifies the coordinates in `obj` based on the direction: 'U' decreases the first coordinate by 1, 'D' increases the first coordinate by 1, 'L' decreases the second coordinate by 1, and 'R' increases the second coordinate by 1. The function does not return any value, but the list `obj` is updated in place. The direction `d` remains unchanged.
