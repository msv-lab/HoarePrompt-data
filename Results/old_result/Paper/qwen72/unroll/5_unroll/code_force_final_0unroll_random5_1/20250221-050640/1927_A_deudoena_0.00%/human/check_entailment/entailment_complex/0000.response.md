Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve a specific problem: determining the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make an entire strip of cells white. The function reads a single string `inpstr` from the user, which represents the strip of cells. It then finds the index of the first 'B' (black cell) and the index of the last 'B' in the string. The length of the segment to be painted is calculated as the difference between the length of the string and the sum of these indices.

However, the function does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The function should accept the number of test cases `t` and a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s`. Instead, the function only processes a single string and does not take `t` or the list of tuples as input.

Additionally, the calculation `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` is incorrect. The correct calculation should be `ind2 + ind1 + 1` to get the length of the segment from the first 'B' to the last 'B' (inclusive).

Given these issues, the function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
