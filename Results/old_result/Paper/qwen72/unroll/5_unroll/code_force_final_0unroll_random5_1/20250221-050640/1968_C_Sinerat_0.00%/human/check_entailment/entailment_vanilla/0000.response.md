### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`**:
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 500. This is a valid choice because `a[0]` must be an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). The choice of 500 is arbitrary but works for the problem constraints.

2. **Construction of the array `a`**:
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
   - This construction ensures that `a[i] \bmod a[i - 1] = x[i]` because:
     - `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`
     - When `a[i]` is divided by `a[i - 1]`, the quotient is 1 and the remainder is `x[i - 1]`.
     - Therefore, `a[i] \bmod a[i - 1] = (a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]) \bmod a[i - 1] = x[i - 1]`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The values of `a[i]` are constructed as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, where `x[i - 1]` is between 1 and 500.
   - Since `a[0]` is 500, the maximum value of `a[i]` for any `i` will be \(500 + 500 \times (n - 1)\), which is \(500 \times n\).
   - Given that \(n \le 500\), the maximum value of `a[i]` will be \(500 \times 500 = 250000\), which is well within the limit of \(10^9\).

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the array `a` for each test case, which satisfies the conditions as explained above.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
