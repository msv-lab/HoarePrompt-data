The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t` to ensure the loop executes.

The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `_` is a placeholder**
