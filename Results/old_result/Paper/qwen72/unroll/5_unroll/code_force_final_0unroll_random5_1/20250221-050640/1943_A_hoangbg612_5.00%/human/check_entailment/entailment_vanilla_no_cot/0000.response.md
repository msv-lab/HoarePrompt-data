Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game. The logic for determining the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX by iterating through the sorted array `N` and checking if the current number is greater than the current MEX candidate (`cur`). However, this approach does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both players. The MEX should be determined based on the elements that Alice and Bob choose, not just by the order of elements in the array.

2. **Handling of Bob's Turn**: The program does not explicitly handle Bob's turn. It should consider that Bob will always try to minimize the MEX, which means he will choose elements that prevent Alice from forming a sequence that would increase the MEX.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy for Alice is to pick the smallest missing integer that is not yet in `c` and is not picked by Bob. Bob, on the other hand, will try to pick the smallest available integer that is not the smallest missing integer Alice is aiming for. The program does not reflect this strategy.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array `a` contains only one unique element or when the array is already in a form that makes it difficult for Alice to maximize the MEX.

Here is a corrected version of the program that implements the optimal strategy:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Count the frequency of each number in N
        count = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            count[num] += 1
        
        # Determine the MEX
        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if count[i] == 0:
                mex = i
                break
            elif count[i] == 1:
                mex = i + 1
                break
            else:
                count[i] -= 2
        
        # If all numbers are present at least twice, the MEX is S
        if mex == 0 and all(count[i] >= 2 for i in range(S)):
            mex = S
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version:
- Counts the frequency of each number in the array `N`.
- Determines the MEX by checking the smallest missing integer.
- Ensures that Bob's optimal strategy of minimizing the MEX is considered by checking if the count of any number is exactly 1, which means Bob can pick it to prevent Alice from forming a higher MEX.
- Handles the case where all numbers are present at least twice, in which case the MEX is `S`.

This should correctly solve the problem as described.
