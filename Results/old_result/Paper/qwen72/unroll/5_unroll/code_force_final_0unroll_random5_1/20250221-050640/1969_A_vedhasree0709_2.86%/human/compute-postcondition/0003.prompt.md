You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers p of length n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) where p_i represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function should return the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party for each test case.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        i = 0
        
        j = 0
        
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        
        if j == 0:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it checks if there is a pair of friends (i, i+1) such that the best friend of the i-th friend is (i+1) and the best friend of the (i+1)-th friend is (i). If such a pair is found, it prints 2 and sets `j` to 1, breaking out of the loop. If no such pair is found, it prints 3. After all iterations, the loop finishes, and the values of `n` and `l` are reset for each new test case, while `i` and `j` are used within the loop and reset to 0 at the start of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of integers `p`. It returns the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
