Reasoning:

The original assessment is partially correct in identifying that the program does not handle the beauty calculation as specified in the problem description. However, the assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect is based on a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements.

1. **Problem Description**: The problem specifies that the beauty of the array is the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The goal is to maximize this sum by rearranging the elements of the array.

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` is incorrect according to the problem statement, which requires \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) without the absolute value.

3. **Correct Calculation**:
   - To maximize the sum \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\), the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\).
   - This is because sorting the array in ascending order ensures that each difference \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) is non-negative, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     1 1 1
     ```
     The sorted array is \([1, 1, 1]\), and the beauty is \((1 - 1) + (1 - 1) = 0\), which is correct.
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     3
     3 1 1
     ```
     The sorted array is \([1, 1, 3]\), and the beauty is \((1 - 1) + (3 - 1) = 0 + 2 = 2\), which is the maximum possible beauty for this array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's use of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` is indeed incorrect, but the overall logic of sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences is correct for maximizing the beauty.
   - The correct calculation should be \((array[i] - array[i - 1])\) without the absolute value.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the use of `abs`, but the conclusion that the program is incorrect is based on a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements. The program should be modified to use \((array[i] - array[i - 1])\) instead of `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])`.

Final: **False**. The program is incorrect because it uses `abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])` instead of \((array[i] - array[i - 1])\).
