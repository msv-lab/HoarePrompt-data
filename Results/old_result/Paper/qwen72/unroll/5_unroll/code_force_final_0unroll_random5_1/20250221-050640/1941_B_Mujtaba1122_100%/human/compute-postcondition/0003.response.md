Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- The list is modified such that for each index `i` (1 <= i < n - 1):
  - If `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` were greater than 0, then:
    - `list[i]` and `list[i - 1]` are reduced to 0.
    - `list[i + 1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i - 1]`.
  - If at any point `list[i - 1]` is not 0, the loop prints 'no' and returns, leaving the list in an undefined state.
  - Otherwise, the loop completes and the list is in a state where no index `i` (1 <= i < n - 1) has `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i - 1] > 0` and `list[i + 1] > 0`.
- Additionally, the function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes a series of modifications to the list and a condition that if the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the list has been successfully modified to meet the specified criteria.
- The `print('YES')` statement is executed after `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`.
- Since `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, it implies that the list has been modified according to the rules and no 'no' was printed during the process.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print 'YES' because the function `func_1(list, n)` has returned `True`, indicating that the list has been successfully modified to meet the specified criteria.

Output: **YES**
