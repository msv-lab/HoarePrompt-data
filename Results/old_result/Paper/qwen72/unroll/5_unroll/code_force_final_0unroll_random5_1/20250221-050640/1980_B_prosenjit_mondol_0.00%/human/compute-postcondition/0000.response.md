The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state before the loop starts should ensure that the input is a positive integer, which will determine the number of iterations.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and does not need adjustment**
