Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order for certain inputs. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
1010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

**Explanation:**
- The string `1010` needs to be sorted to `0011`.
- One optimal way to do this is:
  1. Choose the substring `101` (from index 0 to 2) and perform a cyclic shift: `1010` → `0101`. Cost = 3.
  2. Choose the substring `010` (from index 1 to 3) and perform a cyclic shift: `0101` → `0011`. Cost = 3.
- The total cost is 3 + 1 = 4.

However, the provided program computes the cost as 3, which is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it does not correctly account for the cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string. Specifically, it does not consider the cost of shifting the last '1' to the end of the string when there are multiple '1's and '0's interspersed.
