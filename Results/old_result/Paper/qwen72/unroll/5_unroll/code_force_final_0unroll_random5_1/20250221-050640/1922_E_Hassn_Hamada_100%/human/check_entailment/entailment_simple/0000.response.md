### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The input \( X \) is a positive integer in the range \( 2 \leq X \leq 10^{18} \).
   - If no such array exists, the program should output \(-1\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate the required sequence and append it to `result`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns (0, 0), which is not used in the program.
   - The function iterates over the range from the maximum value in `sequence` to 0, in reverse order.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `size` and `value` such that `value` is the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed by adding `size` elements to the sequence.
   - It then checks if `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If so, it updates `size_overlap` and breaks the loop.
   - The function appends `size - overlap` elements to `sequence`.
   - It recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and `sequence`.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - **Incorrect Return Value**: The function `func_1` returns (0, 0) when `number` is 0, but this return value is not used in the program. This is a minor issue but can be misleading.
   - **Incorrect Calculation of `size_overlap`**: The loop and the calculation of `size` and `value` are complex and might not correctly handle all cases, especially for large values of `number`.
   - **Recursive Call**: The recursive call to `func_1` with `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` might not correctly reduce the problem size, leading to potential infinite recursion or incorrect results.
   - **Output Handling**: The program prints the length of `result` and the elements of `result` for each test case. However, it does not handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, which should output \(-1\).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated for a given `X`.
   - The logic for generating the sequence and the recursive call might not always produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The program lacks a mechanism to ensure that the sequence length does not exceed 200.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for all valid inputs. Specifically, it does not handle the case where no valid sequence can be generated, and the logic for generating the sequence and the recursive call might not always produce the correct number of increasing subsequences. Additionally, there is no mechanism to ensure that the sequence length does not exceed 200.
