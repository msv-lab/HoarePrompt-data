Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) provided.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(n, s):
```

Given this, the correct precondition is:

Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".**
