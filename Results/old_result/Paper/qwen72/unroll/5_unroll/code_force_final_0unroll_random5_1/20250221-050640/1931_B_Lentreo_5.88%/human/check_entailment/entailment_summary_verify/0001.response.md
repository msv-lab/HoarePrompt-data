### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers, each with a certain amount of water.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) / n` because the total sum is divisible by `n`.
   - The operation allows us to pour water from any container to any container with a higher index. This means we can only move water to the right, not to the left.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - To determine if it is possible to balance the containers, we need to check if the water can be distributed such that each container has the target amount of water.
   - If the last container (index `n-1`) already has the target amount of water, we need to ensure that the remaining containers can be balanced by pouring water to the right.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - The program then calculates the difference between each container's water and the last container's water.
   - It sums these differences and checks if the sum is zero.
   - If the sum is zero, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the last container's water amount is the target amount for all containers.
   - The correct target amount should be `sum(nums) / n`.
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the last container's water amount is not the target amount.
   - The logic of summing the differences between each container's water and the last container's water is flawed. It should instead check if the total water can be evenly distributed by ensuring that the sum of the differences from the target amount is zero.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not correctly determine the target amount of water for each container and does not properly check if it is possible to balance the containers by pouring water to the right.

### Correctness:
**False**
