The only objects in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `main_ar`. If `main_ar` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element), the loop will execute. The state of `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` does not affect the execution of the loop, but for the loop to start, `main_ar` must have at least one element, and `val_b` will be the first element of `main_ar`.

State: **`main_ar` must have at least one element, `val_b` is the first element of `main_ar`, `sec_arr` remains unchanged, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr`**
