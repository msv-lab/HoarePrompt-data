You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    n = 0

    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1

        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0' and '1' characters).
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` remains the same binary string, `n` is the number of '1's in `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is preceded by at least one '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each '0' in s that is preceded by at least one '1', and n is the number of '1's in s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from user input. It calculates and prints a value `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in `s` that is preceded by at least one '1', where `n` is the number of '1's encountered before the '0'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the binary string `s` remains unchanged, and the value `ans` is printed to the console.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` in each iteration.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where `t` must be between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. The function then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` in each iteration. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected by the loop.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) has a cost of \( r - l + 1 \).
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - **Function 1**: This function processes a single binary string.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered.
     - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character of the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2**: This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of Function 1**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of '1's (`n`) and calculates the cost of shifting '0's past '1's.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring being shifted, which includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - The function prints the total cost for a single test case.

4. **Correctness of Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, each time calling `func_1` to process a new binary string.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string has no '0's or no '1's, the function correctly handles these cases by not adding any cost.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \( O(|s|) \) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for each test case, as it only uses a few variables.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and efficiently computes the minimum total cost for sorting the binary string.

Correctness: **True**
