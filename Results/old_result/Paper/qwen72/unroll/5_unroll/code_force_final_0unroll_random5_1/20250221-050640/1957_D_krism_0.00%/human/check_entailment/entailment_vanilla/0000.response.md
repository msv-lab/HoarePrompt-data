### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of the input array `arr`.
   - This is done using the line `prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])`.

3. **Initialization of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The program initializes two 2D arrays `pre` and `suf` with dimensions 32x2.
   - `pre[i][0]` and `pre[i][1]` are used to count the number of prefix XOR values that have the `i`-th bit set to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `suf[i][0]` and `suf[i][1]` are used to count the number of suffix XOR values that have the `i`-th bit set to 0 and 1, respectively.
   - The program correctly initializes `pre[i][0]` to 1 for all `i` because the prefix XOR array starts with 0.

4. **Suffix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over the prefix XOR array in reverse order to populate the `suf` array.
   - This is done using the line `suf[j][1] += 1` if the `j`-th bit of `cur` is set, and `suf[j][0] += 1` otherwise.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program iterates over each element `i` in the array to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` such that `1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n` and `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.
   - The key observation is that `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) = prefix[y] \oplus prefix[x-1] \oplus prefix[z] \oplus prefix[y] = prefix[x-1] \oplus prefix[z]`.
   - The program uses the bit-level counts in `pre` and `suf` to determine the number of valid tuples for each bit position.

6. **Updating Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - For each `i`, the program updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays to reflect the current prefix and suffix XOR values.
   - This is done using the lines `pre[j][1] += 1` and `suf[j][1] -= 1` if the `j`-th bit of `c` is set, and `pre[j][0] += 1` and `suf[j][0] -= 1` otherwise.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of valid tuples for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Counting Valid Tuples:**
  - The program attempts to count valid tuples by using the bit-level counts in `pre` and `suf`, but the logic for determining the number of valid tuples is flawed.
  - Specifically, the line `ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` does not correctly account for the condition `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.
  - The correct approach would involve checking the condition for each possible tuple `(x, y, z)` directly, which is not done in this program.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
