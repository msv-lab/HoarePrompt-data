### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game where they alternately pick elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob's goal is to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case starts with an integer `n` (size of the array `a`), followed by `n` integers.
   - The output is the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
     - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys in `M` that have a count of 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy involves both players picking the smallest available element that is not already in `c`.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly sorts the array and uses a dictionary to track the counts of elements.
   - The loop correctly identifies the MEX by checking if the current element is greater than the expected MEX value.
   - However, the logic to increment `cur` and break the loop when the MEX is found is not entirely correct. The program should continue to check all elements to ensure the correct MEX is found.
   - The final checks and updates of `cur` based on the counts in `M` are unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle cases where the array `N` contains all elements from 0 to `n-1` (MEX would be `n`).
   - It should also handle cases where the array `N` contains duplicates and gaps.

7. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The program can be simplified by directly finding the MEX after sorting the array and removing duplicates.
   - The optimal strategy can be implemented by ensuring that Alice and Bob pick elements in a way that the MEX is determined correctly.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Sorting and Initialization:**
  - The array `N` is sorted, which is correct.
  - `cur` is initialized to -1, which is a good starting point for tracking the MEX.

- **Main Loop:**
  - The loop iterates through the sorted array `N`.
  - The condition `if num > cur` is correct for checking if the current element is greater than the current MEX.
  - The condition `if num > cur + 1` is intended to break the loop when the MEX is found, but it is not necessary to break the loop immediately. The loop should continue to check all elements to ensure the correct MEX is found.
  - The dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences, but this is unnecessary for finding the MEX.

- **Final Checks:**
  - The check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is not necessary and may lead to incorrect results.
  - The list `cnt` is created to store keys with a count of 1, but this is also unnecessary for finding the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program has logical issues and overcomplications. The program does not correctly handle all edge cases and the final checks and updates are unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
