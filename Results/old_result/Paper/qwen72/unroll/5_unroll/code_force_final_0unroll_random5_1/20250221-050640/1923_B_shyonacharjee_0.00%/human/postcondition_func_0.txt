The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves a set of monsters with given health and initial positions. The function determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters in each test case by firing bullets at them. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the time constraints, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the `test_cases` list (if it exists) is not modified. The function sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions and calculates the total number of bullets needed to defeat them, checking if this is feasible within the time available.
