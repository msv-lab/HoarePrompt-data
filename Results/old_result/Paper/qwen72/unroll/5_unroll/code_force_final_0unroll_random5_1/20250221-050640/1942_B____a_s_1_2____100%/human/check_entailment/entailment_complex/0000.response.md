Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to reconstruct a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each `a[i]` is defined as the MEX of the first `i+1` elements of `p` minus `p[i]`. The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes a list `p` of length `n` with `-1` (indicating that the values are not yet determined).
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the initial assumption that the MEX of the entire permutation is `n` (since `n` is not in the range of `0` to `n-1`).
   - It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`):
     - For each index `i`, it calculates `p[i]` as `mex - a[i]`.
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: The initial value of `mex` is set to `n`, which is correct because `n` is not a valid index in the permutation `p` (which ranges from `0` to `n-1`).
   - **Reverse Iteration**: The loop iterates from the last element to the first element. This is crucial because the MEX of the entire permutation is known to be `n` initially, and as we move backwards, we can update the MEX based on the values we have already determined.
   - **MEX Calculation**: The MEX is updated to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly calculated `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer that has not been used in the permutation so far.
   - **Final Output**: The list `p` is printed for each test case, and it should satisfy the condition `a[i] = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p[i]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `n = 1` correctly because the MEX of a single-element permutation is `1` (since `0` is the only valid element).
   - The function also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as these are valid inputs and the algorithm correctly reconstructs the permutation.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the function:
     - For `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the output `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` is correct.
     - For `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the output `p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` is correct.
     - For `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the output `p = [2, 0, 1]` is correct.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` for the given array `a` and satisfies the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
