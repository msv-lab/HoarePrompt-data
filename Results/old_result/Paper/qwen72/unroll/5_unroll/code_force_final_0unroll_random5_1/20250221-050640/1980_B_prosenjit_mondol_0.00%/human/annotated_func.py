#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases)`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values shown on the cubes. Each `n` is the number of cubes, `f` is the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, `k` is the number of cubes to be removed, and `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100. Additionally, 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k - 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on the input. The value `x` is set to the value of the cube at index `f-1` in the list `a`. The list `a` is then sorted in descending order. The loop checks if the value of the cube at index `k-1` in the sorted list `a` is greater than, less than, or equal to `x` and prints 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE' accordingly. After all iterations, the variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a tuple containing the number of cubes `n`, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube `f`, the number of cubes to be removed `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes. For each test case, it determines whether it is possible to remove exactly `k` cubes while keeping Dmitry's favorite cube based on the values of the cubes. The function prints 'NO' if the value of the `k`-th largest cube is greater than the value of the favorite cube, 'YES' if the value of the `k`-th largest cube is less than the value of the favorite cube, and 'MAYBE' if the value of the `k`-th largest cube is equal to the value of the favorite cube and the conditions are met. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the input variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
