The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 200,000, and `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` is between 0 and `n-1`. The function returns a string `s` of `n` characters, which is reconstructed based on the trace provided in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns a string `s` of `n` characters reconstructed from the trace in `a`.**
