You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        healths = list(map(int, input().split()))
        positions = list(map(int, input().split()))
        monsters = sorted(zip(positions, healths), key=lambda x: abs(x[0]))
        total_bullets_used = 0
        success = True
        for i in range(n):
            (position, health) = monsters[i]
            distance = abs(position)
            time_available = distance
            bullets_needed = health
            if total_bullets_used + bullets_needed > time_available:
                success = False
                break
            total_bullets_used += bullets_needed
        print('YES' if success else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves a set of monsters with given health and initial positions. The function determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters in each test case by firing bullets at them. It prints 'YES' if all monsters can be defeated within the time constraints, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the `test_cases` list (if it exists) is not modified. The function sorts the monsters based on their absolute positions and calculates the total number of bullets needed to defeat them, checking if this is feasible within the time available.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets you can fire per second `k`.
   - It then reads the healths of the monsters and their positions.
   - The program sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character (i.e., the absolute value of their positions).

2. **Logic for Survival:**
   - The program initializes `total_bullets_used` to 0 and `success` to True.
   - It iterates through each monster in the sorted list.
   - For each monster, it calculates the distance from the character (`distance = abs(position)`) and the time available to kill the monster (`time_available = distance`).
   - It also calculates the number of bullets needed to kill the monster (`bullets_needed = health`).
   - The program checks if the total number of bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available. If it does, the character cannot survive, and `success` is set to False.
   - If the character can survive, it adds the bullets needed to `total_bullets_used`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all monsters for a test case, the program prints 'YES' if `success` is True, otherwise 'NO'.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly sorts the monsters based on their distance from the character, which is essential because the character needs to prioritize killing the closest monsters first.
- The logic to check if the total number of bullets used plus the bullets needed for the current monster exceeds the time available is correct. This ensures that the character does not run out of time to kill a monster before it reaches the character.
- The program correctly handles the constraints and input format as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and should work correctly for the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
