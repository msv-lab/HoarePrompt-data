The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function should process a series of test cases, where the number of test cases t is given and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
