Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes the constant `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus required for the output.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the probability `c` of selecting a pair of friends from all possible pairs of children using the formula:
     \[
     c = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^{-1} \mod M
     \]
   - This is correct because the total number of pairs of children is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), and the probability of selecting a specific pair is the reciprocal of this value modulo \(M\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program reads the friendship values of the `m` pairs and sums them up in the variable `a`.
   - This is correct as it correctly accumulates the initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions using the formula:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - The original assessment correctly identified that this formula can be simplified to:
     \[
     s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - This simplification is necessary to avoid unnecessary multiplications and ensure correctness.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program ensures that the result is taken modulo \(M\) at the end.
   - This is correct as it ensures the result fits within the required constraints and is in the correct form.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `m` is 0 (no friends) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - It also handles the case where `m` is 1 (one pair of friends) correctly, as the friendship value increases linearly.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses efficient operations such as modular inverse and modular addition, which are necessary for handling large inputs within the constraints.
   - The original program has a minor inefficiency that can be corrected by precomputing \(c^2\) outside the loop.

Given the original assessment, the program is indeed almost correct but has a minor inefficiency in the expected value calculation. The correct formula should be:
\[
s = s + c^2 \cdot i \cdot m + c \cdot a
\]

The corrected version of the program provided in the original assessment is:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        c2 = c * c % M
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c2 * i * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

This corrected version ensures that the expected value calculation is done efficiently and correctly.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the inefficiency in the expected value calculation, but the provided correction is accurate and should be used.)
