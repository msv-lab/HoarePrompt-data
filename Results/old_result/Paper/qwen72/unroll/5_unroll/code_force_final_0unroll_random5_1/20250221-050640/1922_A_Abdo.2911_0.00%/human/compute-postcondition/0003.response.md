The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and each of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` consists of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a string that is the result of some operation involving `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Since the specific return value based on the inputs is not provided, I will describe the general functionality of the function.
