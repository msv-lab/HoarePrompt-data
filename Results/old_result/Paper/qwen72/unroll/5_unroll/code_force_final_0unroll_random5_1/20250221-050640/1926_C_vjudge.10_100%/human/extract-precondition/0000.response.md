Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters based on the problem description. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, n_list):
```

With the corrected function definition, the precondition is:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, and n_list is a list of t integers where each integer n satisfies 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5.**
