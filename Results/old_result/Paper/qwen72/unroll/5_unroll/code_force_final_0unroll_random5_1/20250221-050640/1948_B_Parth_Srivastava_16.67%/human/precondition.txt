The function `thing` is not properly defined to match the problem description. The function should take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. The input constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
