### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch with specific rules for moving players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - The game is played on a grid with dimensions \(N \times M\).
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as the Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team, and scoring in one's own goal gives a point to the opponent.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include all events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1(obj, d)`:**
     - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
     - It modifies the position of the entity in place.
     - The function seems to correctly handle the movement of entities.

   - **Function `func_2(t)`:**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
     - The function sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing the events, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

3. **Missing Components:**
   - The provided code snippets are incomplete. They only cover the movement of entities and the elimination of players.
   - The code does not handle the following:
     - Initial setup of the field and entities.
     - Scoring goals.
     - Catching and throwing the Quaffle.
     - Updating the score.
     - Printing the final score.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code does not initialize the `player`, `blud`, and other necessary variables.
   - There is no function to handle the scoring of goals.
   - There is no function to handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.
   - The code does not reset the Quaffle's position to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The code does not print the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code snippets are not sufficient to solve the problem as described.
   - The code lacks essential functionalities such as initializing the game state, handling scoring, and managing the Quaffle.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
