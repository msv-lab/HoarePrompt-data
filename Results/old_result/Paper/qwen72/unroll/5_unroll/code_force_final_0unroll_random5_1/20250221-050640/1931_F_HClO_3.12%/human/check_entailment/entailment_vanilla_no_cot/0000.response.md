Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the input and output format as specified, and the logic within the function `func()` is designed to determine if there is a consistent order of participants that all the screenshots could correspond to, taking into account the perspective of each user who posted a screenshot.

The program checks the following:

1. If there is only one screenshot, it automatically prints 'yes' since a single screenshot can always correspond to a valid order.
2. It compares the first two screenshots to determine if they can be consistent with a single order by removing the user who posted the screenshot from the other user's perspective.
3. If the first two screenshots are not consistent, it prints 'no' and moves on to the next test case.
4. If the first two screenshots are consistent, it determines the correct order by considering the relative positions of the users who posted the first two screenshots.
5. It then checks the remaining screenshots against this determined order, ensuring that each screenshot is consistent with the order by removing the user who posted the screenshot.
6. If all screenshots are consistent, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The program's logic and flow are appropriate for the problem, and it should work correctly for the given constraints and test cases.
