### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version.
   - This function is correct and will return `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the elements of the array `list1` starting from the second element.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it replaces the previous element with its digits.
   - The program then checks if the array is sorted after performing the operation.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program only performs the operation once for each pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10. This might not be sufficient to sort the array in all cases.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted. However, if the array is `[12, 3, 28, 5]`, the program will split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 28, 5]`. It will then split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 2, 8, 5]`. This array is still not sorted, and the program will not split `8` further, leading to an incorrect output.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
     - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted. The output is `YES`, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 2**: `[12, 28, 5]`
     - The program will split `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 28, 5]`.
     - It will then split `28` into `[2, 8]`, resulting in `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`.
     - The array is still not sorted, and the program will not split `8` further. The output is `NO`, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 3**: `[0, 0]`
     - The array is already sorted. The output is `YES`, which is correct.

6. **General Case**:
   - The program may fail in cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. For example, `[12, 3, 28, 5]` will not be sorted correctly by the program.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not handle all cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only performs the split operation once for each pair of elements, which is insufficient for some test cases.
