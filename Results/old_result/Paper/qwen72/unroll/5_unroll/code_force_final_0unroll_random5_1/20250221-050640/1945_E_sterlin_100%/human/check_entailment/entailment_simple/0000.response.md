### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.

2. **Permutation Index Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `num_indx` that maps each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).

3. **Binary Search Simulation:**
   - The program initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until `left + 1 < right`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates the `seen` array to mark the element at `p[mid]` as seen.
   - If `p[mid] <= x`, it updates `left` to `mid`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `right` to `mid`.

4. **Result Determination:**
   - After the loop, if `p[left] == x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` array, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `left + 1` and `num_indx[x]`.
   - If `x` is seen but `p[left] != x`, it prints `2` and the indices to swap `num_indx[temp[0]]` and `num_indx[x]`, and then `num_indx[temp[0]]` and `left + 1`.

5. **Edge Cases and Validation:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `x` is already at the correct position.
   - It also correctly identifies when `x` is not seen and performs a single swap to place `x` at the correct position.
   - For the more complex case where `x` is seen but not at the correct position, it performs two swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the binary search simulation and the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` is found at the correct position. The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is sound and aligns with the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
