Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to verify if it meets the problem description and produces the expected output for the given inputs.

### Problem Description Recap:
- **Objective:** Calculate the maximum beauty of an array `a` by rearranging its elements.
- **Beauty Definition:** The sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
- **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with an array of integers.
- **Output:** For each test case, the maximum beauty of the array.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- **Function Behavior:** `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
- **Sorting:** Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, which is not necessarily the optimal way to maximize the beauty. The beauty is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i - 1})`, not the sum of absolute differences.
- **Calculation:** The function calculates the sum of absolute differences, which is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should be to maximize the sum of `(a_i - a_{i - 1})`.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- **Function Behavior:** `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
- **Input Handling:** The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the array elements.
- **Function Calls:** For each test case, `func_2` calls `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
- **Output:** After processing all test cases, it prints each result to the console.

### Conclusion:
- **`func_1` is Incorrect:** `func_1` calculates the sum of absolute differences, which is not the correct way to maximize the beauty of the array. The correct approach would be to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`.
- **`func_2` is Correct:** `func_2` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases, but it relies on `func_1` which is incorrect.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, `func_1` should be modified to sort the array in descending order and then calculate the sum of `(a_i - a_{i - 1})` for `i` from 2 to `n`.

### Corrected `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort(reverse=True)
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i - 1] - array[i]
    return beauty
```

### Final Correctness:
Since `func_1` is incorrect and `func_2` relies on it, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
