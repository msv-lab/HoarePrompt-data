Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (where `inf` is set to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` to handle the maximum possible value of `n`).

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program precomputes the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `inf` and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` list.
   - For each number `i`, it converts `i` to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums these digits.
   - The cumulative sum is stored in `values[i]` by adding the sum of the digits of `i` to `values[i-1]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the value of `n` and prints the precomputed cumulative sum `values[n]`.

This approach ensures that the program can handle up to `10^4` test cases efficiently within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, as the precomputation is done only once and the lookups for each test case are O(1).

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.
