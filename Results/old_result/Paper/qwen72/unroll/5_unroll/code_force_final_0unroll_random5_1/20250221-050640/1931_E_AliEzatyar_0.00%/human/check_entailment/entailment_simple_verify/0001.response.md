### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m` and the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting:**
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.
   - It iterates over each item in the `array` and adds the length of the string representation of the item to `total_digits`.
   - It also calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends the count to the `zeros` list.

3. **Trailing Zeros Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order and then iterates over it in steps of 2, summing up the values at even indices to `subtract_zero`.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the answer to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the answers for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:**
  - The answer should be 'Sasha' instead of 'Sashah'. This is a minor typo but will cause the program to output incorrect results.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but the typo in the output string 'Sashah' will cause the program to produce incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified the typo and provided a corrected version of the program. The logic of the program is sound and should work correctly once the typo is fixed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the typo 'Sashah' which should be 'Sasha'. Once this typo is corrected, the program will be correct.
