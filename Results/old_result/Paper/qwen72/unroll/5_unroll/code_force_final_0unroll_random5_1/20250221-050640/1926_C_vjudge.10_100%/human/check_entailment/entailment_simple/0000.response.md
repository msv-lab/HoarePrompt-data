### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (200001) with all elements set to 0. This list will store the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` for each `i` from 1 to 200000.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program iterates over each integer `i` from 1 to `inf - 1` (200000).
   - For each integer `i`, it calculates the sum of its digits by converting `i` to a string and summing the integer values of each character.
   - It then updates the `values` list at index `i` to be the cumulative sum of the digits from 1 to `i` by adding the sum of the digits of `i` to the cumulative sum of the digits of `i-1`.

3. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - The program then processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `value` from the input.
   - It prints the cumulative sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to `value` by accessing `values[value]`.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(n) time, where `n` is 200000. This is efficient and within the time limit.
   - Each test case is processed in O(1) time by simply accessing the precomputed list `values`. This ensures that the program can handle up to 10,000 test cases within the 0.5 seconds time limit.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sums in the `values` list.
   - For each test case, it correctly prints the sum of the digits of the integers from 1 to the given `value`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

**Correctness: True**
