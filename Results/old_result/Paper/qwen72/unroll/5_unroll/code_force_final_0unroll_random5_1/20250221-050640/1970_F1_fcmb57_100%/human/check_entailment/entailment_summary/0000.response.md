Reasoning:

The provided program has a critical flaw in the `func_1` function, which is responsible for moving players on the grid. The function is supposed to take the current position of a player (a tuple of two integers) and a direction (a tuple of two integers representing the change in position). However, the `mouvements` dictionary is defined with directions as keys and tuples as values, but when calling `func_1`, the direction is passed as a string, not a tuple. This causes a `TypeError` because the function attempts to unpack a string as if it were a tuple.

Additionally, the program does not handle the Quaffle's position or the logic for catching and throwing the Quaffle correctly. The Quaffle's position is not tracked separately, and the program does not check if a player is carrying the Quaffle before scoring. It also does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
