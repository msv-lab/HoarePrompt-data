You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It processes each test case by applying the function `func_1` to the array of integers and collects the results. After processing all test cases, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
   - The array can be split at any index, and the two resulting parts can be swapped any number of times.

2. **Analyzing Function 1:**
   - `func_1(arr)` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No' if any element is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not consider the possibility of splitting and swapping the array to achieve a sorted order.

3. **Analyzing Function 2:**
   - `func_2()` reads input from `sys.stdin.read` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of each array `n`.
   - It correctly splits the input data and converts it to the appropriate format.
   - It calls `func_1(arr)` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The main issue is with `func_1(arr)`. It only checks if the array is already sorted, but it does not check if the array can be sorted by splitting and swapping.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be sorted by swapping the prefix and suffix.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to find a split point `i` such that the array can be split into `x = arr[:i]` and `y = arr[i:]`.
   - After swapping, the array should be `y + x`.
   - The array `y + x` should be non-decreasing.
   - Additionally, the last element of `y` should be less than or equal to the first element of `x` to ensure the array remains non-decreasing after the swap.

6. **Proposed Correct Function:**
   - We need to modify `func_1(arr)` to check for the possibility of sorting by splitting and swapping.

### Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because `func_1(arr)` does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.
