Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The \texttt{MEX} of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes the permutation \( p \) with \(-1\) values.
   - It sets the initial \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to \( n \), which is the maximum possible value for \(\texttt{MEX}\) since the permutation contains integers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - It iterates over the array \( a \) from the last element to the first element.
   - For each element \( a_i \), it calculates \( p_i \) as \( \texttt{MEX} - a_i \).
   - It updates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and \( p_i \).
   - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

3. **Verification of the Algorithm**:
   - The key insight is that by iterating from the end to the beginning, the program ensures that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is correctly updated based on the elements already placed in the permutation.
   - The calculation \( p_i = \texttt{MEX} - a_i \) ensures that \( p_i \) is consistent with the given \( a_i \).
   - The \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is updated to the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and \( p_i \) to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to that point.

4. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the first test case with \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \):
     - Start with \( \texttt{MEX} = 5 \).
     - \( p_4 = 5 - 2 = 3 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 3 \).
     - \( p_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 2 \).
     - \( p_2 = 2 - (-2) = 4 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 2 \).
     - \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 1 \).
     - \( p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - The resulting permutation is \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \), which is correct.

   - For the second test case with \( a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \):
     - Start with \( \texttt{MEX} = 5 \).
     - \( p_4 = 5 - 1 = 4 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 4 \).
     - \( p_3 = 4 - 1 = 3 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 3 \).
     - \( p_2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 2 \).
     - \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 1 \).
     - \( p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - The resulting permutation is \( p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] \), which is correct.

   - For the third test case with \( a = [-2, 1, 2] \):
     - Start with \( \texttt{MEX} = 3 \).
     - \( p_2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 1 \).
     - \( p_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - \( p_0 = 0 - (-2) = 2 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - The resulting permutation is \( p = [2, 0, 1] \), which is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \) for each test case.
   - The logic and steps are sound and consistent with the problem requirements.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The initial state of the program is correctly described: \( t \) is the number of test cases, \( n \) is the length of the permutation, and \( a \) is the input array.
   - The permutation \( p \) is initialized with \(-1\) values, which is appropriate as it will be filled in the loop.
   - The \(\texttt{MEX}\) value starts at \( n \), which is the correct initial value.
   - The loop iterates from the last element to the first, ensuring that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is updated correctly based on the elements already placed in \( p \).
   - The calculation \( p_i = \texttt{MEX} - a_i \) is correct and ensures that \( p_i \) is consistent with the given \( a_i \).
   - The \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is updated to the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and \( p_i \), which is necessary to maintain the correct \(\texttt{MEX}\) for the next iteration.
   - The final state of the program is correctly described: the list \( p \) is printed for each test case, and the variables \( t \) and \( n \) remain unchanged.

Based on the annotated code and the reasoning provided, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \) for each test case.
