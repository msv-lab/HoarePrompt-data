### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` for each test case.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and large inputs.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character in the list.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Symmetric Mapping:**
   - The symmetric mapping is correctly implemented by iterating through the sorted list of unique characters and mapping the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   - This ensures that the decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the decoded string to a list `results` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the list `results`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and correctly maps the characters to their symmetric counterparts.

### Correctness:
**True**
