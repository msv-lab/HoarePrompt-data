You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. It then computes a list `p` of the same length as `a`, where each element `p[i]` is calculated based on the minimum excluded value (MEX) of the list `p` starting from `n` and updating as the loop progresses. The final list `p` is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `t` and `n` are unchanged after the function execution, and the list `a` is also unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The \texttt{MEX} of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes the permutation \( p \) with \(-1\) values.
   - It sets the initial \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to \( n \), which is the maximum possible value for \(\texttt{MEX}\) since the permutation contains integers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).
   - It iterates over the array \( a \) from the last element to the first element.
   - For each element \( a_i \), it calculates \( p_i \) as \( \texttt{MEX} - a_i \).
   - It updates the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value to the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and \( p_i \).
   - Finally, it prints the constructed permutation \( p \).

3. **Verification of the Algorithm**:
   - The key insight is that by iterating from the end to the beginning, the program ensures that the \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is correctly updated based on the elements already placed in the permutation.
   - The calculation \( p_i = \texttt{MEX} - a_i \) ensures that \( p_i \) is consistent with the given \( a_i \).
   - The \(\texttt{MEX}\) value is updated to the minimum of the current \(\texttt{MEX}\) and \( p_i \) to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation up to that point.

4. **Example Walkthrough**:
   - For the first test case with \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \):
     - Start with \( \texttt{MEX} = 5 \).
     - \( p_4 = 5 - 2 = 3 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 3 \).
     - \( p_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 2 \).
     - \( p_2 = 2 - (-2) = 4 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 2 \).
     - \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 1 \).
     - \( p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - The resulting permutation is \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \), which is correct.

   - For the second test case with \( a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \):
     - Start with \( \texttt{MEX} = 5 \).
     - \( p_4 = 5 - 1 = 4 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 4 \).
     - \( p_3 = 4 - 1 = 3 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 3 \).
     - \( p_2 = 3 - 1 = 2 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 2 \).
     - \( p_1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 1 \).
     - \( p_0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - The resulting permutation is \( p = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] \), which is correct.

   - For the third test case with \( a = [-2, 1, 2] \):
     - Start with \( \texttt{MEX} = 3 \).
     - \( p_2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 1 \).
     - \( p_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - \( p_0 = 0 - (-2) = 2 \), update \(\texttt{MEX} = 0 \).
     - The resulting permutation is \( p = [2, 0, 1] \), which is correct.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly constructs a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \) for each test case.
   - The logic and steps are sound and consistent with the problem requirements.
