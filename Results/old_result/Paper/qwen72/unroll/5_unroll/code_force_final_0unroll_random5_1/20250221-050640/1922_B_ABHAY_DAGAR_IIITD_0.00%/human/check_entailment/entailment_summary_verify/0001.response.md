### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then processes each test case by calling `func_1(t)`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks, `n`, and the list of exponents, `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`. This is a correct approach to group sticks by their lengths.

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triangles:**
   - The program initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of valid triangles.
   - It also initializes `total_count` to 0, which will keep track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - For each unique exponent `cnt` in `num_of_lens`:
     - If `cnt` (the number of sticks with the same length) is at least 3, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from these `cnt` sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) and adds this to `res`. This is correct.
     - If `cnt` is at least 2, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from these `cnt` sticks and one stick from the previously processed sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \) and multiplies it by `total_count`. This is also correct.
     - It updates `total_count` by adding the current `cnt`.

4. **Triangle Inequality:**
   - The program implicitly uses the triangle inequality theorem by ensuring that the lengths of the sticks (which are powers of 2) can form a non-degenerate triangle. For sticks of lengths \(2^a\), \(2^b\), and \(2^c\) (where \(a \le b \le c\)), a non-degenerate triangle can be formed if and only if \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\). This is only possible if \(a = b = c\), which is why the program only counts combinations of sticks with the same length.
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(a = b = c\) by using the combination formula for choosing 3 sticks from the same length.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where \(a = b\) and \(c\) is a different length by using the combination formula for choosing 2 sticks from the same length and one stick from the previously processed sticks.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when there are fewer than 3 sticks or when all sticks have different lengths. In these cases, the number of valid triangles is 0, and the program correctly outputs 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
