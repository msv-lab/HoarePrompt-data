Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The loop iterates `tests` times, and for each iteration, it reads `slength`, `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. The variable `no` is set to `True` at the start of each iteration and may be changed to `False` during the iteration. The loop prints 'NO' if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, or if any character in `c` is not found in the corresponding positions in `a` or `b`. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and breaks the loop. After `tests` iterations, the loop completes.**
