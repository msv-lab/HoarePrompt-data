Output State: **`ind2` is 0, `ind1` is 0, the function still accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. `inpstr` is a string input provided by the user.**

The code snippet `ind2 = 0` initializes `ind2` to 0, but since `ind1` was already 0, both `ind1` and `ind2` remain 0. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state are not affected by this code snippet.
