Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, the logic for checking if the array can be sorted by splitting elements is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
   - The program attempts to split the element `arr[i - 1]` and check if the resulting digits are sorted. However, it does not actually perform the insertion of the digits back into the array in the correct position.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the element `arr[i - 1]` is split and the resulting digits are inserted, and then the next element `arr[i]` might need to be split as well.

2. **Incorrect Comparison**:
   - The program checks if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` plus `arr[i]` are sorted, but it should be checking if the entire array can be sorted after performing the operations.

3. **Missing Handling of Multiple Operations**:
   - The program does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations on different elements in the array to achieve a sorted state.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Split any element in the array that is at least 10 into its digits.
- Check if the resulting array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted(arr):
    # Function to split an element into its digits
    def split_element(x):
        return [int(d) for d in str(x)]
    
    # Split all elements in the array that are at least 10
    new_arr = []
    for num in arr:
        if num >= 10:
            new_arr.extend(split_element(num))
        else:
            new_arr.append(num)
    
    # Check if the new array is sorted
    return new_arr == sorted(new_arr)

def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_be_sorted(arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`split_element` Function**:
   - This function takes an integer and returns a list of its digits.

2. **`can_be_sorted` Function**:
   - This function iterates through the array and splits any element that is at least 10.
   - It then checks if the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The main function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calls the `can_be_sorted` function to determine if the array can be sorted and prints the result.

This corrected approach ensures that all elements are properly split and the entire array is checked for sorting, which is the correct way to solve the problem.
