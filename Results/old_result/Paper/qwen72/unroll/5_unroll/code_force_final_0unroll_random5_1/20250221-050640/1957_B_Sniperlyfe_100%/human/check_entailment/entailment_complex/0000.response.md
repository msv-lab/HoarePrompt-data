Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. This part is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **First Element**: The first element of the sequence `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\). This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - **Remaining Elements**: The function then iterates over the remaining elements of the sequence. For each element, it sets the value to the minimum of \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}}\) (which is the next power of 2 after the first element) and the remaining value of `k`. This ensures that the sum of the sequence remains equal to `k` while maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - **Final Adjustment**: After the loop, if there is any remaining value in `k`, it is added to the first element `nums[0]`. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

3. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and prints them, which is correct according to the output format specified in the problem.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the function `func_1`:
- **Bitwise OR Maximization**: The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. The current approach sets the first element to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length() - 1}} - 1\) and then distributes the remaining value of `k` among the other elements. This approach might not always maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 5`:
- The current approach sets `nums[0]` to \(2^2 - 1 = 3\) (binary `11`).
- The remaining value of `k` is `2`, so `nums[1]` is set to `2` (binary `10`).
- The sequence is `[3, 2]`, and the bitwise OR is `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which has 2 bits set to 1.

However, a better solution would be:
- Set `nums[0]` to `5` (binary `101`), which has 2 bits set to 1.
- Set `nums[1]` to `0`.
- The sequence is `[5, 0]`, and the bitwise OR is `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which has 3 bits set to 1.

To fix this, the function should distribute the value of `k` in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. One way to do this is to set the first element to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and then distribute the remaining value among the other elements.

Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    largest_power_of_2 = 1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)
    nums[0] = largest_power_of_2 - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(largest_power_of_2, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
```

Given the original function, the program does not always produce the correct sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

Correctness: **False**
