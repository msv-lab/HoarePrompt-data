Correctness: **False**

The program provided is incorrect because it does not handle the transition from 12-hour format correctly for the hour "12". Specifically, the program always sets the time to "AM" for the hour "12", which is incorrect. The hour "12" should be "PM" when it is in the second half of the day (i.e., 12:00 to 23:59).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        (h1, m1) = ('', m)
        time = ''
        if h == '00':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'AM'
        elif h == '12':
            h1 = '12'
            time = 'PM'
        else:
            h1 = h if int(h) < 12 else str(int(h) - 12).zfill(2)
            time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version handles the transition correctly and ensures that the hour "12" is "PM" when it should be.
