You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 26 and 1 <= k <= 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)
        
        if k == 1:
            print(n * s)
        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration of the loop, and `t` remains unchanged. The loop prints a string `s` for each iteration, where `s` is a sequence of characters from 'a' to the character corresponding to `k` (inclusive). If `k` is 1, it prints `n` times the string `s`. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints `s` twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it prints `s` once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (both between 1 and 26, inclusive) from the user. The function constructs a string `s` consisting of the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet. If `k` is 1, it prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the string `s` twice unless `n` is 1, in which case it prints `s` once. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
2. **String Construction**: The program constructs a string `s` by concatenating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is done using a loop that iterates from `97` to `97 + k - 1` (inclusive), converting each integer to its corresponding character using `chr(j)`.
3. **Special Case for k == 1**: If `k` is 1, the program prints the string `s` repeated `n` times. This is correct because if `k` is 1, the only possible string of length `n` is `s` repeated `n` times.
4. **General Case for k > 1**: If `k` is greater than 1, the program prints the string `s` repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times. This means:
   - If `n` is 1, the string `s` is printed twice.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the string `s` is printed once.

However, this approach is incorrect for the general case when `n > 1` and `k > 1`. The problem requires that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets must be subsequences of the output string `s`. The current approach does not ensure this property.

For example, consider `n = 2` and `k = 2`. The possible strings of length 2 are `aa`, `ab`, `ba`, and `bb`. The program outputs `ab`, which does not contain `aa`, `ba`, or `bb` as subsequences.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, such as constructing a de Bruijn sequence or using a combinatorial method to ensure all possible subsequences are included.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for the general case.
