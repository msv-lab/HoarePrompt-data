### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost to sort each string.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string.
   - The function iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's encountered.
   - When a '0' is encountered and there are '1's before it, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's plus one (the length of the substring from the first '1' to the current '0').

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the cost of sorting the string by focusing on the transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - Each time a '0' is encountered after one or more '1's, the cost is incremented by the number of '1's plus one, which is the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted to move the '0' to the correct position.
   - This approach ensures that the string is sorted with the minimum number of operations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the cost will be zero, which is correct.
   - If the string contains no '1's (e.g., "0000"), the cost will also be zero, which is correct.
   - If the string contains no '0's (e.g., "1111"), the cost will be zero, which is correct.
   - If the string has a mix of '1's and '0's, the algorithm correctly calculates the cost by summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be shifted.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) for each string, where n is the length of the string.
   - The overall complexity is O(T * n), where T is the number of test cases and n is the sum of the lengths of all strings, which is within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the algorithm to find the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic is sound and handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
