### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input in a loop, extracting the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.
   - This approach is efficient and works within the constraints provided.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string, which is stored in `unique_chars`.
   - A dictionary `char_map` is then created to map each character in `unique_chars` to its symmetric character in the list. This is done by iterating over the list and mapping the i-th character to the (len_unique - 1 - i)-th character.
   - The program then constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding value from `char_map`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly follows the steps described in the problem:
     - It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
     - It creates a symmetric mapping for each character in `r`.
     - It applies this mapping to the encoded string to produce the decoded string.
   - The mapping ensures that the first character in `r` is replaced by the last, the second by the second last, and so on, which is exactly what the problem requires.

4. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of decoding each test case in a list `results` and prints them one by one after processing all test cases.
   - This ensures that the output format matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and produces the correct decoded strings for each test case.

**Correctness: True**
