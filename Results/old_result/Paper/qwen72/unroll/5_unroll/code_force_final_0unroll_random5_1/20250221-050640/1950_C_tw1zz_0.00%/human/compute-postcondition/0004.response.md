Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440). For each test case, it reads a string `s` in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It then prints the converted time for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will reflect the last time conversion performed, and the initial state of the input values will remain unchanged. **
