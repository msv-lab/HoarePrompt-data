### Reasoning

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

2. **Loop to Determine the Layer**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0 and keeps track of the cumulative count of cards laid down so far.
   - The variable `m` is initialized to 1 and represents the current multiplier (1 for odd, 2 for twice odd, 3 for thrice odd, etc.).
   - The `while` loop continues as long as `n` is non-zero. Inside the loop:
     - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of cards in the current layer.
     - `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which effectively reduces `n` to the next layer of cards.
     - The condition `if s < k and k <= s + x` checks if the k-th card is in the current layer. If it is, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `s` is incremented by `x` and `m` is doubled to move to the next layer.

3. **Calculating the k-th Card**:
   - After the loop breaks, the k-th card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - `k - s` gives the position of the card within the current layer.
   - `2 * (k - s) - 1` generates the odd-numbered card within the current layer.
   - Multiplying by `m` scales the card to the correct value for the current layer.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 1`:
     - `x = 4`, `n = 3`, `s = 0`, `m = 1` (first layer: 1, 3, 5, 7)
     - `1 ≤ 1 ≤ 4`, so the loop breaks.
     - `k - s = 1`, `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`, `1 * 1 = 1` (correct output: 1)
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 5`:
     - `x = 4`, `n = 3`, `s = 0`, `m = 1` (first layer: 1, 3, 5, 7)
     - `s += 4`, `m *= 2` (second layer: 2, 6)
     - `x = 2`, `n = 1`, `s = 4`, `m = 2`
     - `4 < 5 ≤ 6`, so the loop breaks.
     - `k - s = 1`, `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`, `1 * 2 = 2` (correct output: 2)
   - For `n = 7` and `k = 7`:
     - `x = 4`, `n = 3`, `s = 0`, `m = 1` (first layer: 1, 3, 5, 7)
     - `s += 4`, `m *= 2` (second layer: 2, 6)
     - `x = 2`, `n = 1`, `s = 4`, `m = 2`
     - `s += 2`, `m *= 2` (third layer: 4)
     - `x = 1`, `n = 0`, `s = 6`, `m = 4`
     - `6 < 7 ≤ 7`, so the loop breaks.
     - `k - s = 1`, `2 * 1 - 1 = 1`, `1 * 4 = 4` (correct output: 4)

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` and `k = 1` correctly by outputting 1.
   - The program also handles large values of `n` and `k` within the specified range, as the operations are efficient and do not exceed the constraints.
