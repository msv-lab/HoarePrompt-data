### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Reading Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of pairs to be chosen.
   - It then reads a line of `2n` integers and splits it into a list `list1`.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list `list1` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest available number in each pair. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are at the beginning of the list.

4. **Selecting Minimum Values**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and selects every second element (starting from the first element) to add to `list2`. This is because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements will be at the beginning, and selecting every second element ensures that we are always choosing the smaller number in each pair.
   - However, the program should select the first `n` elements from the sorted list, not every second element. The current implementation is incorrect in this regard. It should be selecting the first `n` elements, which are the smallest `n` elements in the sorted list.

5. **Calculating the Score**:
   - The program calculates the sum of the elements in `list2`, which represents the maximum score for the current test case.
   - It appends this sum to the `out` list.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the `out` list and prints each score.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - Sorting the list is the correct approach to ensure that the smallest elements are chosen first.
  - However, the selection of elements is incorrect. The program should select the first `n` elements from the sorted list, not every second element.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case of a single test case and multiple test cases.
  - It also handles the edge case where all elements are the same (as in the third test case).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step is efficient enough for the given constraints (up to 100 elements per test case, and up to 5000 test cases).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it selects every second element from the sorted list instead of the first `n` elements. This leads to an incorrect score calculation.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
