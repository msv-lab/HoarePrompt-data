### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It does this by comparing the original list `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst`.
   - If the original list is equal to the sorted list, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - This function is correct and does not modify the input list `lst`.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it iterates over the array `list1` starting from the second element.
   - It checks if the current element `list1[p]` is less than the previous element `list1[p - 1]` and if the previous element is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.
   - After potentially performing the operation, it checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program only performs the operation once for each pair of elements where the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10.
   - This approach is incorrect because the operation might need to be applied multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array.
   - For example, consider the array `[12, 28, 5]`. The program will only split `12` into `[1, 2]` and then check if the array is sorted. However, it should also split `28` into `[2, 8]` to achieve a sorted array.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to repeatedly apply the operation to the array until no more elements can be split or the array becomes sorted.
   - This can be achieved by using a loop that continues to apply the operation as long as the array is not sorted and there are elements greater than or equal to 10.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. It only performs the operation once for each pair of elements, which is insufficient.

Final: **False**
