Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

# Annotated Program:
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.

    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):

    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last character of the alphabet ('z') and moving backwards. The characters in `b` are sorted in ascending order, and the first character in this sorted order is mapped to the last available letter in the alphabet, the second to the second last, and so on, until all unique characters are mapped. The length of `b` remains unchanged, and `b` itself is not modified.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string containing the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s` which contains the mapped characters from `char_map` in the order they appear in `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. In `s`, each character from `b` is replaced with a corresponding character from the end of the alphabet, maintaining the original order of characters in `b`. The mapping is based on the sorted unique characters in `b`, with the smallest character in `b` being mapped to the last letter of the alphabet ('z'), the second smallest to the second last ('y'), and so on. The length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.
