Output State: **`size` remains the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`, `overlap` remains the corresponding index from the loop, `size_overlap` remains a tuple (size, overlap), `number` remains unchanged, and `sequence` is updated to contain the integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`. The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the updated `sequence`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `size` remains the largest integer such that `(1 << size) - (1 << overlap) <= number`.
- The value of `overlap` remains the corresponding index from the loop.
- The tuple `size_overlap` remains unchanged as `(size, overlap)`.
- The value of `number` remains unchanged.
- The `sequence` is updated to contain the integers from `overlap` to `size - 1`.
- The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and the updated `sequence`. The return value or further impact of `func_1` is not specified in the initial state, so it is not included in the output state.
