You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 <= a_i <= 99). It modifies the list `a` by breaking down integers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, appending these digits to a new list `c` in a specific order, and then appends the original integer if the condition is not met. The function also maintains a count `n` of the elements in `c`. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the sorted list `d` is equal to `c`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to indicate whether the processed list `c` is sorted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m` and then iterates `m` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine if the array can be sorted.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.
   - It initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.

3. **Transforming the Array**:
   - The function iterates through each element of the array `a`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the transformed array `c` and checks if it is equal to the original transformed array.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- The transformation logic is implemented to split elements greater than 10 into their digits and insert them in the correct order.
- However, the logic for checking if the array can be sorted is flawed. The program only checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to its sorted version `d`. This is not sufficient because the transformation should ensure that the array can be made non-decreasing, not just that it is already sorted.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `12 3 45 67`
  - Transformed: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `12 28 5`
  - Transformed: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `0 0`
  - Transformed: `[0, 0]`
  - Sorted: `[0, 0]`
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for transforming the array is correct, but the final check to determine if the array can be sorted is not. The program should check if the transformed array can be made non-decreasing, not just if it is already sorted.

### Correctness:
**False**
