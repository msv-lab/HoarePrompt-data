Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it reads `k` lines of input, each containing `n` integers that represent the order of participants shown to the author of the screenshot. The function checks if the order of participants, excluding the author of the screenshot, is consistent across all screenshots. If the order is consistent, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function consumes the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the participant order lists, and does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes. **
