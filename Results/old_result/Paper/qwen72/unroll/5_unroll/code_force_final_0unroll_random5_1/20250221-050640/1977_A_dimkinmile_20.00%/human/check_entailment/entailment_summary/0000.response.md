Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. However, this logic is incomplete. The problem requires determining if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, considering that each move can either add or remove a cube.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If `n` is equal to `m`, Nikita can simply add `m` cubes one by one, so the answer is "Yes".
2. If `n` is greater than `m`, Nikita can add `m` cubes and then remove and add cubes in pairs (add one, remove one) to make up the remaining moves. This means that `n` and `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd) for it to be possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
3. If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".

The current program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to determine the correct answer. It fails to consider the parity of `n` and `m`.

Correctness: **False**
