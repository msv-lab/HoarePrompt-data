The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not need to be adjusted since it is not used outside the loop head.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable and starts at 0**
