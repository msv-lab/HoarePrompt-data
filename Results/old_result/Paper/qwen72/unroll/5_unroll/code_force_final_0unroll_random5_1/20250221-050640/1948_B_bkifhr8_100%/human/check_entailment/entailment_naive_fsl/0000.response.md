Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where an element is greater than or equal to 10 and needs to be split into its digits, but the resulting digits are not in non-decreasing order. For example, consider the input:

```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
0 10
```

For the third test case, the array is `[0, 10]`. The program should split `10` into `[1, 0]`, resulting in the array `[0, 1, 0]`, which is not sorted in non-decreasing order. However, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because it does not correctly handle the splitting and sorting of the digits for elements that are greater than or equal to 10.
