You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `a` remains the same list of integers as in the initial state. `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases. `n` and `q` remain the same integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries. `c` remains the same list of integers. `queries` remains the same list of `q` pairs of integers. `b` is now a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `c`, `queries`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'NO' or 'YES' for each query based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array. It takes no parameters directly but reads input from `input()`. The function first reads two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of an array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads `n` integers into an array `a` and initializes another array `b` with the same length. The function computes a cumulative sum for `b` based on the values in `a`, where each element in `b` is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` is greater than 1, otherwise by 2. After computing `b`, the function computes the cumulative sum of `a` and processes `q` queries. For each query, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, and prints 'NO' if the difference `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than `b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x` equals `y`; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has a length of 1. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an integer array `b` such that the conditions are met. For a subarray of length 1, it is impossible to find a `b` that satisfies the condition `a_i ≠ b_i` because `b_i` must be a positive integer and `a_i` is already a positive integer. The program incorrectly prints "YES" for subarrays of length 1, which should be "NO". For example, if the input is:

```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 1
4 4
3 3
1 3
```

The output should be:

```
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

However, the program will print "YES" for the first three queries, which is incorrect.
