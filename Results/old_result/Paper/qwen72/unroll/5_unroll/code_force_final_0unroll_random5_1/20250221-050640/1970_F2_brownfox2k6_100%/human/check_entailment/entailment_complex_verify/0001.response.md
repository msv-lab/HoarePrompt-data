### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves simulating a game of Quidditch with specific rules for moving players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
   - The game is played on a grid with dimensions \(N \times M\).
   - Players can move, catch the Quaffle, and throw the Quaffle.
   - If a player is on the same cell as the Bludger, they are eliminated.
   - Scoring a goal in the opponent's goal gives a point to the player's team, and scoring in one's own goal gives a point to the opponent.
   - The Quaffle returns to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The output should include all events (goals and eliminations) and the final score.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - **Function `func_1(obj, d)`:**
     - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
     - It modifies the position of the entity in place.
     - The function seems to correctly handle the movement of entities.

   - **Function `func_2(t)`:**
     - This function checks if any player is on the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
     - It updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
     - The function sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing the events, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

3. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program initializes the grid and entities based on the input.
   - It processes each action in the game:
     - If the action is a catch (`C`), it updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
     - If the action is a throw (`T`), it checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also resets the Quaffle's position to the center of the field.
     - If the action is a movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), it updates the position of the entity performing the action.
     - After each action, it checks if any players are eliminated by the Bludger and prints the elimination events.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The code correctly initializes the grid and entities.
   - The code correctly processes each action and updates the positions of entities.
   - The code correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger.
   - The code correctly handles the scoring of goals and the resetting of the Quaffle's position.
   - The code correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code snippets, when combined, appear to correctly implement the required functionalities for the Quidditch game simulation.
   - The code initializes the game state, handles scoring, manages the Quaffle, and prints the final score.
   - There are no apparent logical errors or missing components in the provided code that would prevent it from solving the problem as described.
