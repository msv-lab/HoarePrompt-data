### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of the encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` for each test case.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and large inputs, as it avoids repeated calls to `input()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It first creates a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character in the list.
   - Finally, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

3. **Symmetric Mapping:**
   - The symmetric mapping is correctly implemented by iterating through the sorted list of unique characters and mapping the first character to the last, the second to the second last, and so on.
   - This ensures that the decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem. For example, if the unique characters are `['a', 'b', 'c']`, the mapping will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the decoded string to a list `results` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each decoded string in the list `results`.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

- **State within the function `func_1`:**
  - `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from the encoded string.
  - `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse in the list.
  - For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
  - This is correct and ensures that the decoding process is the reverse of the encoding process.

- **State after the function call:**
  - The program returns the string `decoded`, which is a string where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding value in `char_map`.
  - This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. It handles multiple test cases efficiently and correctly maps the characters to their symmetric counterparts.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
