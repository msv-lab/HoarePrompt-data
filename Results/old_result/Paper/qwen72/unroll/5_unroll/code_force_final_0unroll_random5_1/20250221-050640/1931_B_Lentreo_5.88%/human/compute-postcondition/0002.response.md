Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the value of `t` is 0, and the values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged for each test case. The variable `last` holds the last element of the list `nums` for the last test case, and `curr` holds the result of the computation for the last test case. The output for each test case is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `if curr == 0`.**
