Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y` for all possible values of `x`. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The program returns the first `y` it finds such that `x % y == 0` and `2 * y >= x`, but this does not necessarily maximize `gcd(x, y) + y`.

Counterexample:
For `x = 21`, the program will return `y = 18` because it is the first `y` it finds that satisfies `x % y == 0` and `2 * y >= x`. However, the correct `y` that maximizes `gcd(21, y) + y` is actually `y = 7` (since `gcd(21, 7) + 7 = 14` is greater than `gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 19`). The program does not consider all possible values of `y` to find the one that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`.
