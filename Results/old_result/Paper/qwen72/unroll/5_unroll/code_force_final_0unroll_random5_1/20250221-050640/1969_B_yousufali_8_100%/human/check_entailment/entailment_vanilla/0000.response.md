### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift on a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) has a cost of \( r - l + 1 \).
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of these operations.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - **Function 1**: This function processes a single binary string.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered.
     - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character of the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2**: This function handles multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of Function 1**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of '1's (`n`) and calculates the cost of shifting '0's past '1's.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring being shifted, which includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - The function prints the total cost for a single test case.

4. **Correctness of Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, each time calling `func_1` to process a new binary string.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string has no '0's or no '1's, the function correctly handles these cases by not adding any cost.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \( O(|s|) \) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for each test case, as it only uses a few variables.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and efficiently computes the minimum total cost for sorting the binary string.

Correctness: **True**
