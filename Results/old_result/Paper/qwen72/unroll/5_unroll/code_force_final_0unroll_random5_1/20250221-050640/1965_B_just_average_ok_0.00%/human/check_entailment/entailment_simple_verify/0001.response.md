### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by creating a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 2^{23}]`.
   - This sequence is chosen because it can represent any integer from 1 to \(2^{24} - 1\) (which is more than \(10^7\)) using subsets of these powers of 2.

3. **Adjusting the Sequence:**
   - The program then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and stores its index in `idx`.
   - It removes this power of 2 from the sequence and appends three new elements:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because the removed element was necessary to form `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This is a new element that is greater than `k` and can help form sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is another new element that helps in forming sums greater than `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums` and the elements of the sequence.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Sequence Construction:**
  - The initial sequence of powers of 2 is a good choice because it can represent any integer in the range `[1, n]` using subsets.
  - Removing the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and adding the three new elements ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.

- **Subsequence Constraints:**
  - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\), the program ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence.
  - The added elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help in forming all other sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is a power of 2 by removing the exact power of 2 and adding the necessary elements to ensure the sequence meets the conditions.
  - For example, if `k` is 16, the program will remove 16 and add 15, 17, and 18 to the sequence. This ensures that 16 cannot be formed, but all other sums can be formed.

### Verification of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and the parameters `n` and `k` for each test case.
  - The sequence `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).

- **Finding the Largest Power of 2:**
  - The loop `while k >= 1 << idx` finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
  - The index `idx` is then adjusted to point to the correct power of 2.

- **Modifying the Sequence:**
  - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is removed from `nums`.
  - The elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are added to `nums`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the length of the modified sequence `nums` and the elements of the sequence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed. The modifications to the sequence are logically sound and handle edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
