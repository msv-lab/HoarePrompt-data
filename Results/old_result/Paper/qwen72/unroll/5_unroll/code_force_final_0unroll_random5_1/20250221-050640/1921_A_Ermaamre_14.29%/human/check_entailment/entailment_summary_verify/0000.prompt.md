You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x1, y1) = map(int, input().split())
        (x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
        (x3, y3) = map(int, input().split())
        (x4, y4) = map(int, input().split())
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        print(res ** 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function then calculates and prints the area of the square for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the areas of all the squares have been printed, and the variables `x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4`, and `res` are in their final states corresponding to the last test case. The variable `a` (which is `t`) remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of the input. Specifically, the program assumes a specific order of the coordinates, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The coordinates of the corners are given in random order, and the program only checks for a few specific arrangements of the coordinates. This can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 2
4 5
4 2
1 5
```
The program will correctly output `9`. However, if the coordinates are given in a different order:
```
1
1 2
1 5
4 5
4 2
```
The program will not correctly identify the side length of the square and will produce an incorrect result. The program should be modified to correctly identify the side length regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
