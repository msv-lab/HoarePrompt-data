Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect. It should be defined as `def func_1(a, n):` to match the problem description. However, the function reads input directly from `sys.stdin`, which means it doesn't need explicit parameters. This is a valid approach, but it doesn't align with the typical function signature expected for such problems.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for competitive programming where input is provided in a single block.
   - The first element of the list `data` is the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, the function reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

3. **Calculation of the Last Year:**
   - The function initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent periodicity `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), it calculates the next year when the sign will occur using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left( \frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}} \right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
   - The `last_year` is then updated to `next_year`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function appends the calculated `last_year` for each test case to the `results` list as a string.
   - After processing all test cases, the function writes the results to `sys.stdout` with each result on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly. In this case, `last_year` is simply `a[0]`.
   - The function also handles the case where all periodicities are 1 correctly, as the signs will occur every year, and the last sign will occur in year `n`.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
