Reasoning:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. The problem requires a solution that performs binary search on a permutation after allowing up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly. However, the provided program only contains a series of input functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) and does not include any logic for:

1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. Reading the permutation and the number to be found for each test case.
3. Performing up to 2 swaps to rearrange the permutation.
4. Implementing the binary search algorithm.
5. Outputting the number of swaps and the indices of the swapped elements.

The function `func_5` reads a line of input and returns a list of strings, which is a step in the right direction for reading the permutation, but it is not sufficient on its own. The program lacks the core logic necessary to solve the problem, including the binary search and the swap operations.

Final: **False**
