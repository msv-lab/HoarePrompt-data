Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints this difference for each test case. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array into subarrays and then calculating the penalty based on the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.

The correct approach involves splitting the array in such a way that the penalty is minimized. This can be achieved by ensuring that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible, which means balancing the number of '+' and '-' in each subarray. The program should consider all possible splits and choose the one that results in the minimum penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_penalty(s):
    n = len(s)
    penalty = 0
    current_sum = 0
    for char in s:
        if char == '+':
            current_sum += 1
        else:
            current_sum -= 1
        penalty += abs(current_sum)
    return penalty

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(min_penalty(s))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version of the program calculates the minimum penalty by iterating through the string and keeping track of the current sum of the subarray. The penalty is incremented by the absolute value of the current sum after each character, which ensures that the penalty is minimized by considering each possible split point.
