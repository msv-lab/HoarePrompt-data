Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Functions**:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are all input functions that read different types of input from the user. However, these functions are not used in the context of solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is supposed to handle the binary search on a permutation and allow up to 2 swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - The program does read the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case, but it does not implement the binary search algorithm or the logic to perform the necessary swaps.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search loop is present, but it is not correctly implemented. The loop should adjust `left` and `right` based on the comparison of `p[mid]` with `x`, but the current implementation does not ensure that the array is sorted before performing the binary search.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the binary search might fail due to the unsorted nature of the permutation.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to print the number of swaps and the indices to swap, but the logic for determining the correct swaps is flawed. It does not correctly identify the positions that need to be swapped to make the binary search work.

5. **Output**:
   - The output format is not correct. The program should output the number of swaps and the indices to swap, but the current logic does not ensure that the swaps are performed correctly or that the binary search will find the correct element.

Given these points, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the permutation, perform the required swaps, and ensure the binary search works correctly.

Final: **False**
