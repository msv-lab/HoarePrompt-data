You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters. The function reads from standard input, expecting a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, followed by n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the elements of the array.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `index` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`, where `n` is the length of the array for each test case. `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each array in the test cases. `t` remains the same as in the initial state.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: Each result of `func_1` applied to the arrays in the test cases, printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads from standard input a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It processes each test case and returns the result based on the input array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
