Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a significant issue with the program: it does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should win a point, and vice versa. However, the program only checks if the player is at a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team without considering the team of the player. This can lead to incorrect scoring when a player scores in their own goal.

Additionally, the annotated code points out another critical issue: the function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the movement of players, but it raises a `TypeError` because it attempts to unpack an integer `b` into `dx` and `dy`. This is incorrect because `b` is a tuple representing the movement direction, not an integer. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

However, this issue is not the primary reason for the program's incorrectness in the context of the problem description. The primary issue is the incorrect handling of scoring in the wrong goal, which is the focus of the original assessment.

To summarize:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal.
2. The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, which would cause a `TypeError` if the program were to run.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
