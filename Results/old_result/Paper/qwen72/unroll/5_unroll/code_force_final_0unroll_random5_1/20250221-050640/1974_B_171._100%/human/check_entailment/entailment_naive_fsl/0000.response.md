Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct letters of the encoded string `b` in alphabetical order, creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character, and then decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in the mapping. The program handles all edge cases, including strings of length 1 and strings with repeated characters. The input parsing and test case handling are also correctly implemented. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
