### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a triangle is if all three chosen sticks have the same length (i.e., the same exponent). This is because \(2^a + 2^a = 2^{a+1}\), which is not greater than \(2^b\) for any \(b > a\).

4. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \) where `cnt` is the count of sticks with the same length.
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and 1 stick of a different length using the formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total_count \).

5. **Output**:
   - The program appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results after processing all test cases.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies that the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if all three sticks have the same length.
- The combination formulas used are correct for counting the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and 2 sticks of the same length with 1 stick of a different length.
- The program handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

### Correctness:
**True**
