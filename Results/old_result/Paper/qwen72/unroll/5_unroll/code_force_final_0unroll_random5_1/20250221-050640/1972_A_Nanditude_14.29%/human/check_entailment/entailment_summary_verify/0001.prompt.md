You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = 0
    i = 0
    j = 0
    while i < n and j < n:
        if b[j] < a[i]:
            a.pop(-1)
            a = a[:i] + [b[j]] + a[i + 1:]
            cnt += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            j += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_1(arr):
    return sorted(arr, reverse=True)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` containing two sublists, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order. It returns a new list where the entire `arr` is sorted in reverse order, meaning the elements of the sublists are not altered, but the order of the sublists is reversed. The sublist that was originally second (b) now comes first, followed by the sublist that was originally first (a). Both sublists remain sorted in their non-decreasing order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the array `a` of current problem difficulties, and the array `b` of expected problem difficulties.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of new problems proposed. It also initializes two indices `i` and `j` to 0, which will be used to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b`.

3. **Main Loop**: The program uses a while loop to iterate through the arrays `a` and `b` until both indices `i` and `j` are less than `n`.

4. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`. If this condition is true, it means the current problem is too difficult and needs to be replaced.

5. **Replacement and Counting**: When a problem is too difficult:
   - The program removes the last element from `a` using `a.pop(-1)`.
   - It then inserts the expected difficulty `b[j]` at the current position `i` and shifts the remaining elements to the right.
   - The counter `cnt` is incremented to reflect the new problem proposed.
   - The index `j` is incremented to move to the next expected difficulty.

6. **Validating the Loop**: If the current expected difficulty `b[j]` is not less than the current actual difficulty `a[i]`, the program simply increments both `i` and `j` to move to the next pair of difficulties.

7. **Output**: After the loop completes, the program prints the counter `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed to make `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

8. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It sorts an array in descending order, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness of the Main Logic**: The main logic of the program is to ensure that for each `i`, `a[i] <= b[i]` by proposing new problems and replacing the most difficult one. This is done by checking if `b[j] < a[i]` and performing the necessary operations to correct the array `a`.

- **Efficiency**: The program is not the most efficient, as it repeatedly sorts the array `a` by inserting and popping elements. However, for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), this approach is acceptable and will not cause performance issues.

- **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the arrays `a` and `b` are already in the correct order or when all elements in `a` are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly solves the problem as described. It ensures that the number of new problems proposed is minimized and that the final array `a` satisfies the condition `a_i <= b_i` for all `i`.

### Correctness:
**True**
