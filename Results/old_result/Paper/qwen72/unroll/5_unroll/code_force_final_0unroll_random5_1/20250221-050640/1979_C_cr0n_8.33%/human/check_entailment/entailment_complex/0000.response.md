Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to distribute coins among `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means for each outcome `i`, the bet `x_i` should satisfy:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all} \quad i
   \]
   Simplifying, this condition becomes:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{k_i - 1}
   \]

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - It computes `vprod` where each element is `prod // r` for each `r` in `vals`.
   - It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Product Calculation**: The product `prod` of all multipliers is calculated correctly.
   - **vprod Calculation**: Each element in `vprod` is calculated as `prod // r`. This ensures that each `x_i` is a large enough number to potentially satisfy the condition.
   - **den Calculation**: `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`. This value is used to check if the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - **Condition Check**: The condition `den <= 0` is used to determine if a valid distribution of coins is possible. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means the total bet is not less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - **Output**: If `den` is greater than 0, the program prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string. This is a valid distribution of coins because each `x_i` is calculated to ensure the total bet is less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution is possible by printing `-1`.
   - The program ensures that the bets are positive integers and within the constraints (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9).

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
