Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes the constant `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus required for the output.

2. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the probability `c` of selecting a pair of friends from all possible pairs of children using the formula:
     \[
     c = \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^{-1} \mod M
     \]
   - This is correct because the total number of pairs of children is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), and the probability of selecting a specific pair is the reciprocal of this value modulo \(M\).

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values**:
   - The program reads the friendship values of the `m` pairs and sums them up in the variable `a`.
   - This is correct as it correctly accumulates the initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions.
   - The formula used in the loop is:
     \[
     s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value calculation:
     - \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) accounts for the increase in friendship value for each pair of friends chosen in the previous `i` excursions.
     - \( c \cdot a \) accounts for the initial friendship values of the pairs.
   - However, the term \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) can be simplified to \( c^2 \cdot i \cdot m \) to avoid unnecessary multiplications and ensure correctness.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program ensures that the result is taken modulo \(M\) at the end.
   - This is correct as it ensures the result fits within the required constraints and is in the correct form.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `m` is 0 (no friends) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - It also handles the case where `m` is 1 (one pair of friends) correctly, as the friendship value increases linearly.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses efficient operations such as modular inverse and modular addition, which are necessary for handling large inputs within the constraints.
   - The original assessment correctly identified the inefficiency in the expected value calculation, which can be addressed by precomputing \( c^2 \).

Given the original assessment's identification of the inefficiency and the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate. The program as originally written is incorrect due to the inefficiency in the expected value calculation. The corrected version addresses this issue and ensures the program is correct.

Final: **False**
