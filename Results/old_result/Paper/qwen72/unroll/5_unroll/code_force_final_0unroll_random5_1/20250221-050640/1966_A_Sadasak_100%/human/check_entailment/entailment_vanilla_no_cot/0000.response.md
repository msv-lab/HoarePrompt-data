Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the frequency of each number in the list, but it caps the frequency at `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `k = 3` and a number appears 5 times, the frequency should be 5, not 3.

2. **Checking for `k` in Frequency Values**:
   - The program checks if `k` is in the frequency values and prints `k - 1` if it is. This is not the correct approach. The goal is to minimize the number of cards left, and the presence of `k` in the frequency values does not necessarily mean that the minimum number of cards left is `k - 1`.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The program prints `n` if `k` is not found in the frequency values. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of performing operations to reduce the number of cards.

A correct approach would involve:
- Calculating the frequency of each number.
- Determining how many cards can be removed by performing the operations.
- The minimum number of cards left is the remainder when the total number of cards is divided by `k-1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums)
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    return frequency_table
```

This corrected version:
- Does not cap the frequency at `k`.
- Correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by subtracting the number of cards that can be removed through operations from the total number of cards.
