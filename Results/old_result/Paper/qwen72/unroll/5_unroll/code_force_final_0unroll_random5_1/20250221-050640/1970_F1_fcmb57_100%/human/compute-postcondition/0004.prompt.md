You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd. The function also implicitly assumes that the input will be followed by a grid of a x b pairs of characters, and a series of actions for the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program raises a TypeError because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, no value is returned.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers representing the dimensions N and M of a field, with the constraints 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b being odd. The function is intended to process a grid of a x b pairs of characters and a series of actions for a game, but it raises a TypeError because it attempts to unpack `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which is not possible since `b` is an integer. Therefore, the function does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program raises a TypeError because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, no value is returned.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
