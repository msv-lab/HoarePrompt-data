The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` where the characters from `s` are rearranged in the order of increasing depth of the parentheses sequence, starting from the shallowest to the deepest. The original string `s` remains unchanged.
