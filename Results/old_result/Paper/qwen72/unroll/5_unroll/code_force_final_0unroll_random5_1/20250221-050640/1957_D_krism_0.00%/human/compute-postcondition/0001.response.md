Output State: **The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array and the number of elements in the array, such as `def func_1(a, n):`, where `a` is a list of integers and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each element `a_i` in `a` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, so the actual function might need to be called within a loop that iterates over the number of test cases `t`, where 1 <= t <= 10^4. `n` is an input integer.**
