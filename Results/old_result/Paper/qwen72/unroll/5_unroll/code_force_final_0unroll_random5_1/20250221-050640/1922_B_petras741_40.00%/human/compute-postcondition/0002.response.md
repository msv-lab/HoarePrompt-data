The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already given to be within the range 1 <= t <= 10^4, the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, for clarity, we can specify the initial state of `i` and confirm that `t` is within the required range.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
