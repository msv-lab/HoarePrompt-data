The function `func` reads input values for the number of test cases `n` and for each test case, it reads an integer `m` and a list of integers `arr`. For each test case, it checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in ascending order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it has printed the result for each test case. The input variables `n`, `m`, and `arr` for each test case are processed and then discarded, and the function does not modify any global state.
