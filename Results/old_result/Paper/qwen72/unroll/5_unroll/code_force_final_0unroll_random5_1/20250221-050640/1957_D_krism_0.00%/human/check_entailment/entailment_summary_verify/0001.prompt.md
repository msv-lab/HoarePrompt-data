You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It then computes a prefix XOR list `prefix` where each element at index `i` is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index `i-1`, starting with 0. The function also maintains two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists to count the occurrences of 0s and 1s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) in the prefix XOR values. After processing, the function calculates a final integer `ans` based on these counts and prints `ans`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `arr` remain unchanged, `prefix` contains the cumulative XOR values, `pre` contains the updated counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position, and `suf` has all counts set to 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
- We need to find the number of tuples \((x, y, z)\) such that:
  - \( 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n \)
  - \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \)
- \( f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_r \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and the array \( arr \).

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array \( prefix \) where \( prefix[i] = a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus a_i \).
   - This is done correctly using the loop:
     ```python
     prefix = [0]
     for v in arr:
         prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
     ```

3. **Initialization of Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The program initializes two arrays \( pre \) and \( suf \) with dimensions \( 32 \times 2 \) (since integers are up to \( 10^9 \), which fits within 32 bits).
   - The array \( pre \) is initialized with an extra count for the 0th bit:
     ```python
     for i in range(32):
         pre[i][0] += 1
     ```
   - The array \( suf \) is populated by iterating from the end of the prefix array:
     ```python
     for i in range(n, 0, -1):
         cur = prefix[i]
         for j in range(32):
             if cur >> j & 1:
                 suf[j][1] += 1
             else:
                 suf[j][0] += 1
     ```

4. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program iterates over each element in the array to count valid tuples.
   - For each \( i \) (where \( i \) ranges from 1 to \( n \)):
     - It calculates \( y = arr[i - 1] \) and \( k = y.bit_length() - 1 \).
     - It updates the answer \( ans \) based on the counts in \( pre \) and \( suf \):
       ```python
       ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
       ```
     - It updates the \( pre \) and \( suf \) arrays for the current prefix:
       ```python
       c = prefix[i]
       for j in range(32):
           if c >> j & 1:
               pre[j][1] += 1
               suf[j][1] -= 1
           else:
               pre[j][0] += 1
               suf[j][0] -= 1
       ```

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Initialization of Pre Array:**
   - The initialization of the \( pre \) array with an extra count for the 0th bit is incorrect. The prefix array starts with 0, and this should be accounted for in the initialization of \( pre \).

2. **Bitwise XOR Calculation:**
   - The bitwise XOR calculation and the way the program updates the \( pre \) and \( suf \) arrays are not aligned with the problem's requirements. The program seems to be trying to count the number of valid tuples based on the bitwise properties, but it does not correctly implement the condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).

3. **Logic for Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \). It appears to be counting based on the bitwise properties of the prefix XOR, but it does not correctly compute the required function values and compare them.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic to count the number of valid tuples \((x, y, z)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
