Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the initial state of the coins. Each test case consists of a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The function prints 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd, and 'NO' if it is even. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variable `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, where `t` is the number of test cases. The input data remains unchanged. **
