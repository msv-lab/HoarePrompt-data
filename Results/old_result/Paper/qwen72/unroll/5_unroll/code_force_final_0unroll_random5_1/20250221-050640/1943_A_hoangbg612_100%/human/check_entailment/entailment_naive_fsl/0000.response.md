Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends. The logic used in the program to determine the MEX is flawed. For example, the program increments `cur` and breaks the loop if `num > cur + 1`, which is not the correct way to calculate the MEX.

2. **Handling of Single Occurrences**:
   - The program attempts to handle cases where elements occur only once by appending them to `cnt` and then setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` if there are at least two elements. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly, and it does not ensure that Alice and Bob are making the best possible moves.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```
The expected output is `1` because Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. However, the program will output `2` due to its incorrect logic for MEX calculation and handling of single occurrences.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game by considering the optimal moves for both players. Here is a correct approach:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**:
   - Use a frequency array to count how many times each element appears in the array `a`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements. Alice will always pick the smallest element that appears exactly once (to maximize the MEX), and Bob will pick the smallest element that appears more than once (to minimize the MEX).

3. **Calculate the MEX**:
   - After the game ends, calculate the MEX of the array `c` by finding the smallest non-negative integer that does not appear in `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        c = []
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[i] == 1:
                c.append(i)
                freq[i] = 0
            elif freq[i] > 1:
                freq[i] -= 1
        
        cur = 0
        while cur < S and cur in c:
            cur += 1
        
        print(cur)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game and calculates the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
