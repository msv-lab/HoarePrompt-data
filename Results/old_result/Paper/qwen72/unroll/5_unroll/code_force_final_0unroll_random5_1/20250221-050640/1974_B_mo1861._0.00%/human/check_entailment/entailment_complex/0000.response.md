Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` by reversing the encoding process described in the problem statement. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the `char_map` construction. According to the problem, the string `r` should consist of all distinct letters of the original string `s` (not `b`), and these letters should be written in alphabetical order. The encoding process then replaces each character in `s` with its symmetric character from `r`.

The program incorrectly constructs `char_map` by mapping each unique character in `b` to a character from the end of the alphabet, which does not align with the problem's encoding algorithm. Instead, the program should:

1. Construct the string `r` from the original string `s` (which is not directly available but can be inferred from `b`).
2. Map each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

To correctly decode the string, the `char_map` should map the first character in the sorted order of unique characters in `b` to the last character in the sorted order, the second to the second last, and so on. The current implementation maps the first character to the last letter of the alphabet, which is incorrect.

Here is the correct approach:

1. Construct the string `r` by sorting the unique characters in `b`.
2. Create a `char_map` that maps each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.

The current implementation does not follow this approach, and thus the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
