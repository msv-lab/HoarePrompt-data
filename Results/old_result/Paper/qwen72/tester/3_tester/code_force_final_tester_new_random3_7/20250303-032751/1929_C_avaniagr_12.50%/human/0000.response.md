It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the function `has_close_elements` mentioned in the test case instructions. The problem is about Sasha betting in a casino and determining if he can guarantee winning any number of coins, not about checking for close elements in a list. Therefore, I will provide test cases that strictly follow the problem description for the casino betting scenario.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
3
2 1 7
2 3 15
5 4 7
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: Basic cases where Sasha has enough initial coins and the maximum number of consecutive losses is reasonable, allowing him to potentially win any number of coins.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
3
2 1 1
3 3 6
4 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
NO
NO
```
**Scenario**: Cases where Sasha starts with a very small number of coins or the maximum number of consecutive losses is too high, making it impossible to guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
2 2 10
3 2 10
4 2 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
YES
YES
```
**Scenario**: Cases with a moderate number of initial coins and a moderate number of consecutive losses allowed, which should allow Sasha to win any number of coins.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum number of coins (1) and can only lose once in a row. This is the smallest possible input, and he cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2 100 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum number of coins (1) but can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is an extreme case where the maximum number of consecutive losses is very high.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
30 1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and can only lose once in a row. This is the largest possible initial number of coins, and he can guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) but can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is an extreme case where the maximum number of consecutive losses is very high, even with a large initial number of coins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a small number of coins (2) and can only lose once in a row. This is a slightly larger initial number of coins than the minimum, and he can still guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a small number of coins (2) and can lose up to 2 times in a row. This is a case where the initial number of coins is just enough to place a bet, but the maximum number of consecutive losses is too high.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and can only lose once in a row. This is the largest possible initial number of coins with the smallest number of consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
30 100 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum number of coins (1) and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is the smallest possible initial number of coins with the largest number of consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
2 50 50
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a moderate number of coins (50) and can lose up to 50 times in a row. This is a case where the initial number of coins is not sufficient to guarantee winning any number of coins with the given maximum number of consecutive losses.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 100
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a moderate number of coins (100) and can only lose once in a row. This is a case where the initial number of coins is sufficient to guarantee winning any number of coins with the smallest number of consecutive losses allowed.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
2 1 10
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a small number of coins (10) and can only lose once in a row. This is a case where the initial number of coins is just enough to place multiple bets, and he can still guarantee winning any number of coins.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is the largest possible initial number of coins with the largest number of consecutive losses allowed, making it impossible to guarantee winning any number of coins.

**Input**:
```
1
2 1 5
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
