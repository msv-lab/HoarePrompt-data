### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- When `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `m = 0`, both installations launch fireworks every minute, but each firework is only visible for 1 minute. Therefore, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2 0
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- When `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `m = 0`, the first installation launches fireworks every minute, and the second installation launches fireworks every 2 minutes. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- When `a` and `b` are both very large and `m = 1`, the installations launch fireworks at the same frequency, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000001
```
**Explanation**: 
- When `a = 1`, `b` is very large, and `m` is also very large, the first installation launches fireworks every minute, and the second installation launches fireworks very infrequently. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 + 2 * m`.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
2000000000000000001
```
**Explanation**: 
- When `a` is very large, `b = 1`, and `m` is very large, the second installation launches fireworks every minute, and the first installation launches fireworks very infrequently. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 + 2 * m`.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
