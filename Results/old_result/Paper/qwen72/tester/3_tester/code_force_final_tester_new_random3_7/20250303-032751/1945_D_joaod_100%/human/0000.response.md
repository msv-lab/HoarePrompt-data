Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the problem, including both basic and edge scenarios. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**:
```
14
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move to position 2 by paying 7 coins to the person at position 1 and 3 coins to the person at position 2. Total cost = 7 + 3 = 14.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**:
```
22
```
**Explanation**: Kirill can move to position 2 by paying 6 coins to the person at position 1, 8 coins to the person at position 3, and 1 coin to the person at position 4. Total cost = 6 + 8 + 1 = 22.
