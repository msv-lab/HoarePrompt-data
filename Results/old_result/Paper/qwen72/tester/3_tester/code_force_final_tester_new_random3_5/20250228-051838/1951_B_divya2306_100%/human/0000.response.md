```
1
10 1
1 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
8
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the cow of interest is at the beginning but has a very low rating. It ensures the function correctly identifies the optimal swap position to maximize wins, even if the initial position is not favorable.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
