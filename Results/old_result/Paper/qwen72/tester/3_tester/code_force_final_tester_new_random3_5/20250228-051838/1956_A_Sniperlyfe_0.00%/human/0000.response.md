Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem. These test cases cover both basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
3 5
5
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a small number of players and a simple sequence. Players are lined up as ABCDE, and the 3rd and 5th players are kicked out in the first round, leaving A and B as winners.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
5 3
2 4 6 8 10
10
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a larger sequence and a moderate number of players. Players are lined up as ABCDEFGHIJ, and every 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th player is kicked out in the first round, leaving A, C, E, G, I as winners.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
1 3 5
6
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a sequence that includes the first player. Players are lined up as ABCDEF, and the 1st, 3rd, and 5th players are kicked out in the first round, leaving B, D, F as winners. The game continues, and in the second round, B and D are kicked out, leaving F as the winner.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1 5
1
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
0 1 1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: Basic case with a sequence that only includes the first player. The game ends quickly for each number of players, with only the last player remaining as the winner for n > 1.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
100
100
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Edge case with a large number of players and a sequence that only includes the first player. All players are kicked out in the first round, leaving no winners.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
100 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
100

1 1
100
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
