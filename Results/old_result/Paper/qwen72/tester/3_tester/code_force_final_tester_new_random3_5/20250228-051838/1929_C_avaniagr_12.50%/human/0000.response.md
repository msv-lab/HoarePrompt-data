It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the task. The problem is about Sasha betting in a casino, and the output is supposed to be "YES" or "NO" based on whether Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins. However, the function `has_close_elements` mentioned in the test case section is unrelated to the problem. I will provide test cases for the casino betting problem as requested.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can win any number of coins with a strategy of betting 1 coin after a win and 2 coins after a loss, given he cannot lose more than once in a row.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with only 1 coin and can only bet 1 coin. If he loses, he cannot bet anymore, so he cannot guarantee to win any number of coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3 15
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can use a strategy of increasing his bets after a loss, and since he can lose up to 3 times in a row, he can still recover and win any number of coins.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 6
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 6 coins and the bet multiplier is 3. However, he can only lose up to 3 times in a row, which is not enough to guarantee he can win any number of coins starting from 6.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 5 coins and the bet multiplier is 4. He can lose up to 4 times in a row, but this is not sufficient to ensure he can win any number of coins.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
5 4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 7 coins and the bet multiplier is 5. He can lose up to 4 times in a row, which is enough to recover and win any number of coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
4 88 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a very large number of coins (1,000,000,000), but the bet multiplier is 4 and he can lose up to 88 times in a row. This is not enough to guarantee he can win any number of coins.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
25 69 231
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 231 coins, the bet multiplier is 25, and he can lose up to 69 times in a row. Despite the high multiplier, the number of consecutive losses allowed is not sufficient to guarantee he can win any number of coins.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
13 97 18806
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 18,806 coins, the bet multiplier is 13, and he can lose up to 97 times in a row. This is a high number of consecutive losses, but it is still not enough to guarantee he can win any number of coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with only 1 coin and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is an extreme case where the initial number of coins is very low, and the number of consecutive losses allowed is very high.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
30 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a very large number of coins (1,000,000,000), the bet multiplier is 30, and he can only lose once in a row. This is a favorable condition, and he can guarantee to win any number of coins.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can only lose once in a row. He can use a strategy of betting 1 coin after a win and 2 coins after a loss to guarantee he can win any number of coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can lose up to 2 times in a row. He can use a strategy of increasing his bets to recover and win any number of coins.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a very large number of coins (1,000,000,000) but can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is a high number of consecutive losses, and despite the large initial amount, he cannot guarantee he can win any number of coins.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a very large number of coins (1,000,000,000) and can only lose once in a row. This is a favorable condition, and he can guarantee to win any number of coins.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can only lose once in a row. He can use a strategy of betting 1 coin after a win and 2 coins after a loss to guarantee he can win any number of coins.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 3 coins and can lose up to 2 times in a row. He can use a strategy of increasing his bets to recover and win any number of coins.

# Test 18

2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with a very large number of coins (1,000,000,000) and can only lose once in a row. This is a favorable condition, and he can guarantee to win any number of coins.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 2 coins and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This is an extreme case where the initial number of coins is very low, and the number of consecutive losses allowed is very high.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
