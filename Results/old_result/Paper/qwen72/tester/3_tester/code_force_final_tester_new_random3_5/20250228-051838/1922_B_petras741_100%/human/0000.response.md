Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
35
```
**Scenario**: All sticks have the same length, which is \(2^1\). Any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 7 is \(\binom{7}{3} = 35\).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: The lengths of the sticks are \(2^3, 2^2, 2^1, 2^3\). Only two combinations can form a triangle: (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: The lengths of the sticks are \(2^1, 2^2, 2^3\). No combination of these lengths can form a triangle because \(2 + 4 = 6\) is not greater than 8.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: Only one stick is given, so it's impossible to form a triangle with 3 sticks.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
2
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Scenario**: All sticks have the same length, which is \(2^0 = 1\). Any combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle. The number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 5 is \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\).
