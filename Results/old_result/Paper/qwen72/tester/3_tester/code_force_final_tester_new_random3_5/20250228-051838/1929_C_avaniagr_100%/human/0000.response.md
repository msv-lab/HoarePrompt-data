It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the function `has_close_elements` mentioned in the test case instructions. The problem description is about Sasha betting in a casino to achieve any number of coins, while `has_close_elements` is not related to this scenario. I will provide test cases that strictly follow the problem description and format you requested.

2 1 100
3 3 1000
```
**Output**:

2 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the maximum initial number of coins (10^9) and can only lose once in a row. This tests the upper limit of the initial coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
30 100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum initial number of coins (1) and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This tests the lower limit of the initial coins with the maximum consecutive losses.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can lose up to 100 times in a row, but starts with the maximum initial number of coins. This tests the interaction between the maximum initial coins and the maximum consecutive losses.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
30 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha can only lose once in a row, but starts with the minimum initial number of coins. This tests the lower limit of the initial coins with the minimum consecutive losses.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum initial number of coins (2) and can only lose once in a row. This tests the boundary condition where the initial coins are just above the minimum.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
2 100 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum initial number of coins (2) and can lose up to 100 times in a row. This tests the boundary condition with the maximum consecutive losses.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 3 coins and can only lose once in a row. This tests the next boundary condition above the minimum initial coins.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 4 coins and can only lose once in a row. This tests another boundary condition above the minimum initial coins.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with the minimum initial number of coins (2) and can lose up to 2 times in a row. This tests the boundary condition with a small number of consecutive losses.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Sasha starts with 3 coins and can lose up to 2 times in a row. This tests the boundary condition just above the minimum initial coins with a small number of consecutive losses.

These test cases cover a range of basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
