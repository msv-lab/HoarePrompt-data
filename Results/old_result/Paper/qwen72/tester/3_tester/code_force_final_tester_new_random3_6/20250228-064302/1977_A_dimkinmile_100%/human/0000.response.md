Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
3 3
2 4
5 3
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
No
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the basic scenarios where the number of moves and the desired cubes are within the normal range. The first case is a straightforward "Yes" because Nikita can add 3 cubes in 3 moves. The second case is a "No" because it's not possible to end up with 4 cubes in 2 moves. The third case is a "Yes" because Nikita can add 3 cubes in 5 moves by adding and removing cubes.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
4
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 4
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the simplest scenarios where the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes. All these cases should return "Yes" because Nikita can simply add the required number of cubes without any removals.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
10 5
15 10
20 15
25 20
30 25
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks scenarios where the number of moves is significantly greater than the desired number of cubes. All these cases should return "Yes" because Nikita can add the required number of cubes and then remove the excess cubes to reach the desired number.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. It is impossible to have 2 cubes after 1 move, so the output should be "No".

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum limit for both moves and desired cubes. Since the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes, the output should be "Yes".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is at the maximum limit but the desired number of cubes is minimal. Nikita can add 1 cube and then remove the rest, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is slightly greater than the desired number of cubes. Nikita can add 2 cubes and then remove 1, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is minimal but the desired number of cubes is at the maximum limit. It is impossible to have 100 cubes after 1 move, so the output should be "No".

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is just 1 less than the desired number of cubes. Nikita can add 99 cubes and then add 1 more, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is just 1 more than the desired number of cubes. Nikita can add 100 cubes and then remove 1, so the output should be "Yes".

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 0, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints. However, it is included to ensure the function handles invalid input gracefully. The output should be "No".

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the desired number of cubes is 0. Since the tower must have at least 1 cube after 1 move, the output should be "No".

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
100
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
5 5
...
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
...
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a large number of test cases where the number of moves is equal to the desired number of cubes. All these cases should return "Yes" because Nikita can add the required number of cubes without any removals.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
100
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
...
99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
No
No
No
No
...
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a large number of test cases where the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes. All these cases should return "No" because it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
100
2 1
3 2
4 3
5 4
6 5
...
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
Yes
...
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a large number of test cases where the number of moves is just 1 more than the desired number of cubes. All these cases should return "Yes" because Nikita can add the required number of cubes and then remove 1.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
100
100 1
99 2
98 3
97 4
96 5
...
1 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
No
No
No
No
...
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a large number of test cases where the number of moves is significantly greater than the desired number of cubes for some cases and less for others. The first case should return "Yes" because Nikita can add 100 cubes and then remove 99. The rest should return "No" because the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes.

These test cases should help thoroughly evaluate the function's behavior under various conditions, ensuring its robustness and reliability.
