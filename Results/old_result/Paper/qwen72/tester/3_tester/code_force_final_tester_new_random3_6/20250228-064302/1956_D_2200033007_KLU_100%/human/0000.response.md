**Scenario**: Simple case with the smallest possible array of length 2. The MEX of the entire array is 2, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
3
1 3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
13 0
```
**Scenario**: Case where the array already has the maximum possible sum. No operations are needed.

```
**Output**: 
```
324 1
1 18
```
**Scenario**: Maximum array length with all elements being 0. The MEX of the entire array is 1, and setting all elements to 1 maximizes the sum.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
18
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18
```
**Output**: 
```
342 0
```
**Scenario**: Maximum array length with consecutive integers starting from 1. The sum is already maximized, so no operations are needed.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 18
```
**Output**: 
```
342 1
1 18
```
**Scenario**: Maximum array length with a single missing consecutive integer (17). The MEX of the entire array is 17, and setting all elements to 17 maximizes the sum.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
18
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 10000000
