```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Verifies the solution when `x` is 2 and `n` is 2, which should result in the GCD being 1 because the only way to split 2 into 2 positive integers is 1 and 1.

```
49999999
```
**Scenario**: Verifies the solution for a large `x` and `n` equal to 2, which should result in the GCD being half of `x`.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
99999999 99999998
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Tests the solution for a large `x` and `n` just one less than `x`, which should result in the GCD being 1.
