```
**Scenario**: This test case verifies the functionality when Alice has 15 and 100 coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 3 and 10 jewels, respectively. Both cases should return "YES" with valid stall prices.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```

1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum possible value for coins with the minimum possible value for jewels. Bob can set up one stall with a price of 10^18 coins to make Alice buy exactly 1 jewel.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 60
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
60

```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum number of stalls (60) with the maximum possible value for coins. Bob can set up 60 stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, to make Alice buy exactly 60 jewels.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an impossible scenario where Alice has 10^18 coins but Bob wants her to buy 10^18 jewels. It should return "NO" because it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy that many jewels with the given constraints.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
60 60
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
60
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has exactly 60 coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 60 jewels. Bob can set up 60 stalls, each with a price of 1 coin, to make Alice buy exactly 60 jewels.

# Test 10

```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an impossible scenario where Alice has 100 coins but Bob wants her to buy 100 jewels. It should return "NO" because it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy that many jewels with the given constraints.

# Test 11

1000000000000000000 1000000000000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an impossible scenario where Alice has 10^18 coins but Bob wants her to buy 10^18 + 1 jewels. It should return "NO" because it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy that many jewels with the given constraints.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
1
1000000000000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where Alice has the maximum possible number of coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly 1 jewel. Bob can set up one stall with a price of 10^18 coins to make Alice buy exactly 1 jewel.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1000000000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an impossible scenario where Alice has 1 coin but Bob wants her to buy 10^18 jewels. It should return "NO" because it's impossible to set up stalls to make Alice buy that many jewels with the given constraints.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
61 61
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks an impossible scenario where Alice has 61 coins and Bob wants her to buy 61 jewels. It should return "NO" because Bob can only set up a maximum of 60 stalls.

# Test 15
