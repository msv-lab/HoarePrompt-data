Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
3
6
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AAABAACC
NO
YES
MM
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the basic functionality with a mix of different values for `n` (6, 1, and 2). It ensures that the function can handle typical inputs and produce the correct output.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABAA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks for a basic input where `n` is 3. The output string should have exactly 3 special characters.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABAAAB
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks for a basic input where `n` is 5. The output string should have exactly 5 special characters.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABAAABAAABAA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks for a basic input where `n` is 10. The output string should have exactly 10 special characters.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the smallest possible value for `n` (1). Since a string with exactly 1 special character cannot be constructed (a special character must have at least one neighbor), the output should be "NO".

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
50
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the largest possible value for `n` (50). The output string should have exactly 50 special characters and be within the length limit of 200.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
MM
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks for a small value of `n` (2) where the string can be very short. The output string should have exactly 2 special characters.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
49
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks for a value of `n` just below the maximum (49). The output string should have exactly 49 special characters and be within the length limit of 200.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
20
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
AABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAAABAA
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks for a value of `n` that is exactly half of the maximum (20). The output string should have exactly 20 special characters and be within the length limit of 200.
