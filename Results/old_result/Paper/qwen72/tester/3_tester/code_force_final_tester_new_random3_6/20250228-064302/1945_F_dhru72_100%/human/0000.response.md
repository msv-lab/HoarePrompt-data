**Scenario**: This test case covers a variety of basic scenarios with different numbers of mushrooms and different permutations. It ensures that the function can handle typical inputs and produce the correct results.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
1
10
1
```
**Output**:
```
10 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the simplest possible scenario where there is only one mushroom. The elixir strength should be the magic power of the single mushroom, and Kirill should use exactly one mushroom.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
2
5 10
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
10 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario with two mushrooms. The permutation indicates that the first mushroom picked will reduce the magic power of the second mushroom to zero. Therefore, the optimal solution is to pick the second mushroom, which has the higher magic power.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
6 3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the permutation is in ascending order. Kirill should pick all mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength, as picking fewer mushrooms will reduce the magic power of the remaining mushrooms to zero.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
3
3 2 1
3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
6 3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the permutation is in descending order. Kirill should pick all mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength, as picking fewer mushrooms will reduce the magic power of the remaining mushrooms to zero.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 200000
200000 199999 199998 ... 1
```
**Output**:
```
200000 200000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum limit for the number of mushrooms (n = 200,000). The permutation is in descending order, so Kirill should pick all mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
1 2 3 4 5 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
200000 200000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where all mushrooms have the same magic power (1). The permutation is in ascending order, so Kirill should pick all mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
100 10
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where all mushrooms have the same high magic power (10). The permutation is in ascending order, so Kirill should pick all mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
45 9
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the permutation is partially descending and then ascending. Kirill should pick 9 mushrooms to maximize the elixir strength, as picking fewer will reduce the magic power of the remaining mushrooms to zero.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
10 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the magic powers are in descending order and the permutation is in ascending order. Kirill should pick the first mushroom to maximize the elixir strength, as picking more will reduce the magic power of the remaining mushrooms to zero.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
