ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**:
```
0
```

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
5 5
ABCDE
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has exactly one problem of each difficulty level for one round but needs to create 15 more problems to cover five rounds.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
50 1
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGA
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, and he is missing only one difficulty level ('G') for one round.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGA
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, and he is missing only one difficulty level ('G') for five rounds.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEF
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, and he is missing one problem of each difficulty level for five rounds.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
ABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFGABCDEFG
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, and they are perfectly distributed to cover five rounds without needing any additional problems.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
G
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the minimum number of problems needed when Vlad has only one problem in the bank, and it is of difficulty level 'G'. He needs to create 6 more problems to cover all difficulty levels for one round.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
AABBCCEEDDFFGG
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, but they are not evenly distributed. He needs to create 15 more problems to cover all difficulty levels for five rounds.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
AABBCCEEDDFFGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, but some are of an invalid difficulty level ('H'). The function should ignore invalid characters and still calculate the minimum number of problems needed.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
AABBCCEEDDFFGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, but one of them is an invalid difficulty level ('H'). The function should ignore invalid characters and still calculate the minimum number of problems needed.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
50 5
AABBCCEEDDFFGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
```
**Output**:
```
15
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where Vlad has 50 problems, but multiple are of an invalid difficulty level ('H'). The function should ignore invalid characters and still calculate the minimum number of problems needed.

These test cases should help in thoroughly testing the function to ensure it handles various scenarios correctly, including edge cases.
