10 5
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
```

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
3
7 3
9 5
11 7
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
Yes
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Cases where `n` is significantly greater than `m`, but the difference is odd, allowing for the desired tower height to be achieved.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 100
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Scenario**: The maximum possible value for `m` is 100, but `n` is only 1, making it impossible to achieve the desired tower height.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The maximum possible value for `n` is 100, and `m` is 1, which is possible by removing 99 cubes after initially adding 100 cubes.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Both `n` and `m` are at their maximum value, which is possible by adding 100 cubes without any removals.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 2 and `m` is 1, which is possible by adding 1 cube and then removing 1 cube.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 3 and `m` is 2, which is possible by adding 2 cubes and then removing 1 cube.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
4 3
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 4 and `m` is 3, which is impossible because the difference between `n` and `m` is 1, and `n` is even.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
5 4
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 5 and `m` is 4, which is possible by adding 4 cubes and then removing 1 cube.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: The minimum possible value for both `n` and `m` is 1, which is trivially possible.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 100 and `m` is 99, which is possible by adding 100 cubes and then removing 1 cube.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
100 2
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 100 and `m` is 2, which is possible by adding 51 cubes and then removing 49 cubes.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
99 1
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 99 and `m` is 1, which is possible by adding 50 cubes and then removing 49 cubes.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
99 2
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 99 and `m` is 2, which is impossible because the difference between `n` and `m` is 97, and `n` is odd.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
100 101
```
**Output**:
```
No
```
**Scenario**: `m` is greater than `n`, which is impossible as Nikita cannot add more cubes than the number of moves.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 100 and `m` is 50, which is possible by adding 75 cubes and then removing 25 cubes.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
100 51
```
**Output**:
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: `n` is 100 and `m` is 51, which is possible by adding 76 cubes and then removing 25 cubes.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including basic functionality and edge cases, to ensure the code is robust and reliable.
