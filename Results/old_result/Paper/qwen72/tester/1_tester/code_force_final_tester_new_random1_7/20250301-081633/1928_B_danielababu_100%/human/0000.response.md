200000
1 2 3 ... 100000 100000 100000 ... 200000 (100000 repeated three times)
```
**Output**: 
```
100000
```
**Scenario**: Test case with a large array (200,000 elements) where a single value (100,000) is repeated three times. This checks the function's ability to handle large arrays with repeated elements in multiple positions.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
