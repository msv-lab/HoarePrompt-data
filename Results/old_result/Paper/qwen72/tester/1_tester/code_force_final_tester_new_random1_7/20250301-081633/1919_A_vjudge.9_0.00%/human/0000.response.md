It seems there was a slight mix-up in the problem description and the function mentioned (`has_close_elements`). The problem is about determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets, not about a function called `has_close_elements`. I will provide test cases that strictly follow the problem description for the game between Alice and Bob.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
10
1 1
1 4

```
**Output**:
```
Bob
Alice
Bob
Alice
Bob
Bob
Alice
Alice

Bob
```

2 1
3 3
4 4
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
Alice
Bob
Bob
```

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
5
1 3
3 1
2 4
4 2
5 5
```
**Output**:

Alice
Alice
Alice
Bob
```

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the minimum number of coins (1). This is a simple edge case where the game ends in the first round.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player starts with the maximum number of coins (1,000,000,000) and the other with the minimum (1). This tests the function's ability to handle large numbers.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 6, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function is symmetric and handles large numbers correctly regardless of which player has more coins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the maximum number of coins. This tests the function's ability to handle the largest possible input values.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with 2 coins. This is a small but non-trivial case where the game can be played out to a few rounds.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with 3 coins. This is another small but non-trivial case where the game can be played out to a few rounds.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins, and the other has one less. This tests the function's ability to handle very large numbers with a small difference.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
999999999 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 11, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function is symmetric and handles large numbers correctly regardless of which player has more coins.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player starts with the minimum number of coins (1) and the other with 2 coins. This is a simple edge case where the game can be played out to a few rounds.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 13, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function is symmetric and handles small numbers correctly regardless of which player has more coins.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 - 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins, and the other has one less. This tests the function's ability to handle very large numbers with a small difference, using a more complex expression for the second number.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 - 1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 15, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function is symmetric and handles large numbers correctly regardless of which player has more coins, using a more complex expression for the first number.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000 - 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins, and the other has two less. This tests the function's ability to handle very large numbers with a small difference, using a more complex expression for the second number.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 - 2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 17, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function is symmetric and handles large numbers correctly regardless of which player has more coins, using a more complex expression for the first number.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins, and the other has the minimum number of coins (2). This tests the function's ability to handle large numbers with a small number of coins.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 19, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function is symmetric and handles large numbers correctly regardless of which player has more coins.

These test cases cover a range of basic and edge scenarios to ensure the code is robust and reliable.
