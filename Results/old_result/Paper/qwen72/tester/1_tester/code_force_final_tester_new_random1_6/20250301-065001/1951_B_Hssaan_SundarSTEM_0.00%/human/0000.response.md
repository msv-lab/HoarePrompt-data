# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
10 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the scenario with the minimum number of cows (2) and the cow is at the beginning with a higher rating than the other cow, but it still cannot win any matches due to the tournament structure.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
1 10
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the scenario with the minimum number of cows (2) and the cow is at the end with a higher rating than the other cow, but it still cannot win any matches due to the tournament structure.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100000 50000
100000 99999 99998 ... 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
49999
```
