# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: A 2x2 grid with a requirement of 2 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is a case where the minimum number of cells to color is 1, but it covers 2 diagonals.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement of 1 diagonal having at least one colored cell. This is an extreme case testing the upper limit of \( n \).

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**:
```
100000000
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement of 400,000,000 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is an extreme case testing the upper limit of \( k \).

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
100000000 200000000
```
**Output**:
```
100000000
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement of 200,000,000 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is a case where the number of required diagonals is half the total number of diagonals, and the entire grid needs to be colored.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
100000000 200000001
```
**Output**:
```
100000001
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement of 200,000,001 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is a case where the number of required diagonals is just above half the total number of diagonals, and almost the entire grid needs to be colored.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
2 6
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: A 2x2 grid with a requirement of 6 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is an impossible case as a 2x2 grid only has 4 diagonals. The function should handle this by ensuring the minimum number of cells to color is 2, which covers all 4 diagonals.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
3 12
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Scenario**: A 3x3 grid with a requirement of 12 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is an impossible case as a 3x3 grid only has 10 diagonals. The function should handle this by ensuring the minimum number of cells to color is 6, which covers all 10 diagonals.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
100000000 100000000
```
**Output**:
```
100000000
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement of 100,000,000 diagonals having at least one colored cell. This is a case where the number of required diagonals is equal to \( n \), and the entire grid needs to be colored.
