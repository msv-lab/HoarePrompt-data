It seems there might be a mix-up in the problem description. The problem described is about maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon, but the test case format you provided is for a different function, `has_close_elements`, which is not mentioned in the problem description. I will provide test cases for the cake problem as described. Here are the test cases:
