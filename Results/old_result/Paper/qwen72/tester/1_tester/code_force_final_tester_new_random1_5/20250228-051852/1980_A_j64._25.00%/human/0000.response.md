5 5
ABCDEFG
```
**Output**:
```
28
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where Vlad has 5 problems, each of a different difficulty level, but needs to hold 5 rounds. He needs to create 28 new problems (7 problems per round * 5 rounds - 5 existing problems).

1 1
G
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where Vlad has only one problem of difficulty 'G'. He needs to create problems for all other difficulty levels ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F').
