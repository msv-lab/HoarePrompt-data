It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description. The problem you've described is about maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake from a regular polygon, and it does not mention a function called `has_close_elements`. However, I will create comprehensive test cases for the problem as described, focusing on both basic and edge scenarios.
