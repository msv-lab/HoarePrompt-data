```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, but the desired number of cubes is 1, which is possible by removing 99 cubes.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100 100
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is also 100, which is possible by adding 100 cubes.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where both the number of moves and the desired number of cubes are 1, which is the smallest possible input.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 50, which is possible by adding 50 cubes and removing 50 cubes.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 99, but the desired number of cubes is 100, which is impossible.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 99, which is possible by adding 99 cubes and removing 1 cube.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 2, and the desired number of cubes is 1, which is possible by adding 1 cube and removing 1 cube.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 2, and the desired number of cubes is 2, which is possible by adding 2 cubes.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 2, but the desired number of cubes is 3, which is impossible.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
100 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 1, which is possible by adding 1 cube and removing 99 cubes.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
100 0
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 0, which is possible by removing 100 cubes.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 1, and the desired number of cubes is 0, which is impossible.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
100 51
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 51, which is impossible because the parity of `n` and `m` does not match.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
100 49
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the number of moves is 100, and the desired number of cubes is 49, which is possible by adding 49 cubes and removing 51 cubes.

These test cases should help ensure that the solution is robust, reliable, and handles a variety of scenarios correctly.
