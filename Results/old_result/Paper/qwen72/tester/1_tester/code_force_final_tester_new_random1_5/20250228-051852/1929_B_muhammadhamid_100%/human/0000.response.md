### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: A 3x3 grid with a requirement to have at least 4 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is a basic case where the minimum number of cells to color is 2.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: A 3x3 grid with a requirement to have at least 3 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is another basic case where the minimum number of cells to color is 2.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
4 7
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Scenario**: A 4x4 grid with a requirement to have at least 7 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is a basic case where the minimum number of cells to color is 4.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 8
```
**Output**: 
```
4
```
**Scenario**: A 5x5 grid with a requirement to have at least 8 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is a basic case where the minimum number of cells to color is 4.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
2 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: A 2x2 grid with a requirement to have at least 3 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is a basic case where the minimum number of cells to color is 2.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: A 2x2 grid with a requirement to have at least 1 diagonal with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case where the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: A 2x2 grid with a requirement to have at least 2 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case where the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement to have at least 1 diagonal with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case testing the upper limit of the grid size where the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 400000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement to have at least 400,000,000 diagonals (which is the maximum possible for this grid size) with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case testing the upper limit of the number of diagonals where the minimum number of cells to color is 100,000,000.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3 10
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Scenario**: A 3x3 grid with a requirement to have at least 10 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case where the grid size is small but the number of diagonals required is the maximum possible for this grid size, requiring all 6 cells to be colored.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Scenario**: A 3x3 grid with a requirement to have at least 9 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case where the grid size is small but the number of diagonals required is one less than the maximum possible for this grid size, requiring 5 cells to be colored.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
7 11
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Scenario**: A 7x7 grid with a requirement to have at least 11 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case where the grid size is larger but the number of diagonals required is relatively small, requiring 6 cells to be colored.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: A 1x1 grid with a requirement to have at least 1 diagonal with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case testing the smallest possible grid size, where the minimum number of cells to color is 1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100000000 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: A 100,000,000x100,000,000 grid with a requirement to have at least 2 diagonals with at least one colored cell. This is an edge case testing the upper limit of the grid size with a very small number of required diagonals, where the minimum number of cells to color is 2.
