### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the minimum number of coins (1). Alice cannot make a move after the first turn, so Bob wins.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (10^9), and Bob starts with the minimum (1). Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping and then removing coins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000

```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the maximum number of coins (10^9). The game will end in a draw, but since Bob makes the last move, he wins.

# Test 10

```
1
1000000000 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (10^9), and Bob starts with 2. Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping and then removing coins.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000
```
**Output**:

Bob
```
**Scenario**: Bob starts with the maximum number of coins (10^9), and Alice starts with 2. Bob can force Alice to lose by swapping and then removing coins.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000001
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Bob starts with one more coin than Alice, both at the maximum limit. Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping and then removing coins.

# Test 15
**Input**:
