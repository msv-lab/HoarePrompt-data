- It loses the second match against the cow with rating 14.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 1.

#### Test 2: Basic Scenario - Cow in the Middle
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
7 2 12 10 14 13
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 12 is initially in position 3.
- It wins the first match against the cow with rating 7.
- It wins the second match against the cow with rating 2.
- It loses the third match against the cow with rating 14.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 2.

#### Test 3: Basic Scenario - Cow at the End
**Input**:
```
1
6 6
12 10 14 11 8 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 3 is initially in position 6.

- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 0.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 4: Minimum Number of Cows
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
10 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 10 is initially in position 1.
- It plays against the cow with rating 1 and wins.
- Since there are only 2 cows, the maximum number of wins is 0 (as the cow in position 1 cannot win any more matches).

#### Test 5: Maximum Number of Cows
**Input**:
```
1
100000 50000
1 2 3 4 5 ... 100000
```
**Output**:
```
49999
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 50000 is initially in position 50000.
- It will win all matches until it faces the cow with rating 100000.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 49999.

#### Test 6: Cow with the Highest Rating
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
1 2 1000000000 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 1000000000 is initially in position 3.
- It will win all matches because it has the highest rating.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 5.

#### Test 7: Cow with the Lowest Rating
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
1000000000 999999999 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 1 is initially in position 3.
- It will lose all matches because it has the lowest rating.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 0.

#### Test 8: Cow in a Position Where It Can Win All Matches
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 1000000000 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 1000000000 is initially in position 2.
- It will win all matches because it has the highest rating.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 4.

#### Test 9: Cow in a Position Where It Can Win Only One Match
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1000000000 1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 1 is initially in position 2.
- It will lose the first match against the cow with rating 1000000000.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 0.

#### Test 10: Cow in a Position Where It Can Win by Swapping
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 10 11 12 13 14
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 10 is initially in position 2.
- By swapping it to position 3, it will win the first match against the cow with rating 1.
- It will then win the next 4 matches until it faces the cow with rating 14.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 4.

#### Test 11: Cow with a Rating Just Below the Highest
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 1000000000 999999999 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 999999999 is initially in position 3.
- By swapping it to position 2, it will win the first match against the cow with rating 1.
- It will then win the next 3 matches until it faces the cow with rating 1000000000.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 3.

#### Test 12: Cow with a Rating Just Above the Lowest
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 2 is initially in position 2.
- By swapping it to position 3, it will win the first match against the cow with rating 1.
- It will then win the next 4 matches until it faces the cow with rating 6.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 4.

#### Test 13: Multiple Test Cases
**Input**:
```
3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13
2 2
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- This test case combines the scenarios from the example input to verify the solution works for multiple test cases.

#### Test 14: Cow in a Position Where It Can Win by Swapping to the First Position
**Input**:
```
1
6 3
1 2 10 11 12 13
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 10 is initially in position 3.
- By swapping it to position 1, it will win the first match against the cow with rating 2.
- It will then win the next 5 matches until it faces the cow with rating 13.
- Therefore, the maximum number of wins is 5.

#### Test 15: Cow with a Rating Just Below the Second Highest
**Input**:
```
1
6 2
1 1000000000 999999998 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- The cow with rating 999999998 is initially in position 3.
