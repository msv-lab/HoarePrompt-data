2
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
1
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible values of n (1 and 2) to ensure the function handles the minimum input correctly. For n=1, no operations are performed, and for n=2, only one swap is performed.

**Input**:
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
536870912
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the maximum possible value of n (10^9) to evaluate the function's performance and correctness with the largest input. It checks if the function can handle such a large number efficiently.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
3
10
11
12
```
**Output**:
```
10
11
12
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes values of n that are close to each other to verify the function's consistency and correctness for similar inputs. It covers the scenarios where n is 10, 11, and 12.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000000
```
**Output**:
```
524288
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a large value of n (1,000,000) to evaluate the function's performance and correctness with a moderately large input. It checks if the function can handle such a large number efficiently.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
100000000
```
**Output**:
```
536870912
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a very large value of n (100,000,000) to further evaluate the function's performance and correctness with a large input. It checks if the function can handle such a large number efficiently and correctly.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000001
```
**Output**:
```
536870912
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a value of n that is just above the maximum possible value (1,000,000,001) to ensure the function handles out-of-bound inputs correctly. It checks if the function can gracefully handle such inputs.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Error: n exceeds the maximum allowed value of 10^9
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes an extremely large value of n (10,000,000,000) to ensure the function handles out-of-bound inputs correctly. It checks if the function can gracefully handle such inputs and provide an appropriate error message.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
536870912
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the maximum possible value of n (10^9) to ensure the function handles the boundary condition correctly. It checks if the function can handle the largest valid input efficiently and correctly.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
536870912
```
**Scenario**: This test case is a repeat of the maximum possible value of n (10^9) to ensure the function's consistency and reliability when handling the same large input multiple times.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
536870912
```
**Scenario**: This test case is another repeat of the maximum possible value of n (10^9) to ensure the function's consistency and reliability when handling the same large input multiple times.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible value of n (1) to ensure the function handles the minimum input correctly. For n=1, no operations are performed, and the array remains [1].

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes the smallest possible value of n greater than 1 (2) to ensure the function handles the minimum input correctly. For n=2, only one swap is performed, and the array changes to [2, 1].
