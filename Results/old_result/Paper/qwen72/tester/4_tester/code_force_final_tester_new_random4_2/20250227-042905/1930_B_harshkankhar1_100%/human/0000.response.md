1000
3
```
**Output**:
```
1 2 3
1 2 3
...
1 2 3
```

#### Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
4 1 2 3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a specific small value of `n` (4) to ensure it handles this particular input correctly, as it is a common small input that can reveal issues.

#### Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100
```
**Output**:
```
100 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 99
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a medium-sized value of `n` (100) to ensure it can handle a larger input that is still manageable for manual verification.

#### Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1000
```
**Output**:
```
1000 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a large value of `n` (1000) to ensure it can handle a significantly larger input that is still within the constraints.

#### Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10000
```
**Output**:
```
10000 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 9999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a very large value of `n` (10,000) to ensure it can handle a large input that is still within the constraints and verify its performance and correctness.

#### Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
100000
```
**Output**:
```
100000 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 99999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with the maximum possible value of `n` (100,000) again, but this time with a single test case to ensure it can handle the largest input efficiently and correctly.

#### Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
10
```
**Output**:
```
10 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a value of `n` that is a power of 10 (10) to ensure it handles such inputs correctly.

#### Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
15
```
**Output**:
```
15 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 11 12 14 10 13
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a value of `n` that is a prime number (15) to ensure it handles such inputs correctly.

#### Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
100001
```
**Output**:
```
100001 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 100000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a value of `n` that is just above the maximum constraint (100,001) to ensure it handles invalid inputs gracefully (though this input should not be valid according to the problem constraints).

### Additional Test Cases

#### Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
10000
```
**Output**:
```
10000 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 9999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a large value of `n` (10,000) to ensure it can handle a large input that is still within the constraints and verify its performance and correctness.

#### Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
100000
```
**Output**:
```
100000 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 99999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with the maximum possible value of `n` (100,000) again, but this time with a single test case to ensure it can handle the largest input efficiently and correctly.

#### Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
100000
```
**Output**:
```
100000 1 2 4 3 5 6 8 7 9 ... 99999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with the maximum possible value of `n` (100,000) one more time to ensure consistency in handling the largest input.

### Summary
These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including small, medium, and large inputs, as well as edge cases. They are designed to ensure the function is robust, reliable, and scalable. Each test case is well-documented to explain the specific scenario it covers.
