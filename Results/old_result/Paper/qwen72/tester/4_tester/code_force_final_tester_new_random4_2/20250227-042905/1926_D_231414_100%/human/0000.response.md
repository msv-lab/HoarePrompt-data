Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
4
1 4 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Each number has a unique set of bits that conflict with others, so each number must be in its own group.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
2
0 2147483647
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The binary representation of 0 is all zeros, and the binary representation of 2147483647 is all ones. They can be in the same group as they do not share any matching bits.

1
3
0 0 2147483647
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The numbers 0 and 2147483647 can be in the same group, but since there are two 0s, we need 2 groups to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.
