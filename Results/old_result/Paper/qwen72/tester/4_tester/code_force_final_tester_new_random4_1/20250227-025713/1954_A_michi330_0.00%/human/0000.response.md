```
1
4 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: No matter how Alice paints the ribbon, Bob can always repaint two parts to make all parts the same color.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3 1

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The ribbon has two parts, and Alice can use two colors. Bob can repaint both parts, so he can always make all parts the same color.

```
1
3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The ribbon has three parts, and Alice can use three colors. Bob can repaint all three parts, so he can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
50 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The ribbon has 50 parts, and Alice can use 2 colors. Bob can only repaint one part, so he cannot make all parts the same color if Alice paints the ribbon as [1, 2, 1, 2, ..., 1, 2].
