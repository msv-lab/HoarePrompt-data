Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
11
```
**Scenario**: Single type of card, with a large number of coins. The goal is to maximize the number of subarrays of length 1, which is simply the total number of cards.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
2 4
8 4
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: Two types of cards, with enough coins to buy additional cards. The goal is to create the maximum number of subarrays of length 2 that are permutations of [1, 2].

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: Three types of cards, with a moderate number of coins. The goal is to balance the number of cards to maximize the number of subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3 9
7 6 2
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Scenario**: Three types of cards, with a large number of coins. The goal is to buy additional cards to maximize the number of subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
5 3
6 6 7 4 6
```
**Output**: 
```
28
```
**Scenario**: Five types of cards, with a small number of coins. The goal is to use the coins efficiently to maximize the number of subarrays of length 5 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 0
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Single type of card, with no coins. The only possible subarray is the single card itself.
