1
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes longer ribbons with chips spread out, requiring multiple moves to form a single block. It also includes a case where chips are close to each other but still need to be moved.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the minimum possible ribbon length (2 cells) with one chip and one free cell. The chip is already in the leftmost position, so no moves are needed.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```

50
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with a single chip at the rightmost position. No moves are needed since the chip is already in a single block.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```

1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with a single chip at the leftmost position. No moves are needed since the chip is already in a single block.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with two chips at the rightmost positions. Only one move is needed to form a single block.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with all cells containing chips. No moves are needed since all chips are already in a single block.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
```
**Output**: 
```
25
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the maximum possible ribbon length (50 cells) with chips and free cells alternating. The minimum number of moves required is 25, as each chip needs to move to the left to form a single block.
