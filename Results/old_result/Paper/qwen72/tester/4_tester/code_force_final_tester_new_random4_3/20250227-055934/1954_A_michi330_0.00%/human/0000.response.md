```
3
3 3 1
4 3 2
5 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the number of colors and the number of parts Bob can repaint are varied.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
3
2 2 1
3 3 2
4 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
YES
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the number of parts is small and the number of colors and parts Bob can repaint are varied.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
1 10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has only one part, but Alice has multiple colors available. Bob can still repaint the single part to any color.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has multiple parts, but only one color is available. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 9
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when Bob can repaint almost all parts of the ribbon. Alice can still paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has the maximum number of parts and colors, but Bob can only repaint one part. Alice can easily paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50 25
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has the maximum number of parts and colors, and Bob can repaint half of the parts. Alice can still paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
50 50 50
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has the maximum number of parts and colors, and Bob can repaint all parts. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has the minimum number of parts (greater than 1) and Bob can repaint all parts. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has the minimum number of parts (greater than 1) and Bob can only repaint one part. Alice can paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
3 2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has a small number of parts and Bob can repaint almost all parts. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
3 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has a small number of parts, and Bob can repaint almost all parts. Alice can still paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
4 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has a small number of parts, and Bob can repaint a significant portion of the parts. Alice can still paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
4 4 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has a small number of parts, and Bob can repaint almost all parts. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 4
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has a small number of parts, and Bob can repaint almost all parts. Alice can still paint the ribbon to prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has a small number of parts, and Bob can repaint all parts. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
50 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function's response when the ribbon has the maximum number of parts, but only one color is available. Bob can always make all parts the same color.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including the basic and edge cases, to ensure the robustness, reliability, and scalability of the solution.
