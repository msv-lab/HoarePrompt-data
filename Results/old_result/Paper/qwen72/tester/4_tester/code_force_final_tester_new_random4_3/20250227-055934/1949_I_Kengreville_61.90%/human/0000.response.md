0 2 1
2 0 1
2 2 1
```

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
2
0 0 1
3 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```

0 4 2
4 0 2
4 4 2

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
0 0 1
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: With only one disk, we can reduce its radius by any small positive amount, and the condition of no overlap is trivially satisfied.

1000
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
...
999 0 1

```
3
0 0 1
1 0 1
2 0 1
```
**Output**:
```

0 1 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
