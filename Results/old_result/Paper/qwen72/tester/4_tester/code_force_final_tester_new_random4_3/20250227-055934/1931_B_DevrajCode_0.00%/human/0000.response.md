**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... (200,000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```

#### Test 9: Containers with Large Water Amounts
**Input**:
```
1
5
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 10: Containers with Zero Water
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers are already empty, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 11: Containers with Highly Unbalanced Water
**Input**:
```
1
5
0 0 0 0 20
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: It is impossible to balance the containers as the sum of 20 is not divisible by 5.

#### Test 12: Containers with One Large and Others Small
**Input**:
```
1
5
19 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 19 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 23, which is not divisible by 5.

#### Test 13: Containers with All Water in One Container
**Input**:
```
1
5
20 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 20 is divisible by 5, and it is possible to balance the containers by pouring 4 units of water from the first to each of the other containers.

#### Test 14: Containers with Nearly Balanced Water
**Input**:
```
1
5
4 4 4 4 6
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22, and 22 / 5 = 4.4. By pouring 2 units from the last container to any other container, the containers can be balanced.

#### Test 15: Containers with Large Number of Containers and Small Amounts
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1 1 1 ... (200,000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 16: Containers with Large Number of Containers and Large Amounts
**Input**:
```
1
200000
1000000000 1000000000 ... (200,000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: All containers have the same amount of water, so no operations are needed.

#### Test 17: Containers with Random Distribution
**Input**:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15, and 15 / 5 = 3. However, it is impossible to balance the containers using the allowed operations.

#### Test 18: Containers with One Container Having All the Water
**Input**:
```
1
7
28 0 0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
YES
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 28 is divisible by 7, and it is possible to balance the containers by pouring 4 units of water from the first container to each of the other containers.

#### Test 19: Containers with One Container Having More Than the Average
**Input**:
```
1
5
10 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 10 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 18, and 18 / 5 = 3.6. However, it is impossible to balance the containers using the allowed operations.

#### Test 20: Containers with One Container Having Less Than the Average
**Input**:
```
1
5
2 2 2 2 10
```
**Output**:
```
NO
```
**Explanation**: The sum of 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 10 = 18, and 18 / 5 = 3.6. However, it is impossible to balance the containers using the allowed operations.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios, including the basic functionality and edge cases, to ensure the solution is robust and reliable.
