1 1 -1 
2 1 -1 1 2 
2 1 1 3 1 1 4
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers multiple test scenarios with different lengths and configurations of slimes. It ensures that the function can handle various basic configurations and produce the correct output.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the slimes are in strictly increasing order. The last slime cannot be eaten, and each other slime can be eaten by its right neighbor in one second.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 1 1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the slimes are in strictly decreasing order. The first slime cannot be eaten, and each other slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in one second.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1 -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where all slimes have the same size. No slime can eat another, so all outputs are -1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
1 3 2 4 2 5
```
**Output**: 
```
1 2 1 2 1 -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a mixed configuration where some slimes can be eaten quickly and others take longer. The last slime cannot be eaten.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
-1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario where there is only one slime. Since it has no neighbors, it cannot be eaten, so the output is -1.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2
10 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge scenario with the minimum number of slimes (two). The first slime cannot be eaten, and the second slime can be eaten by the first slime in one second.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 10
```
**Output**: 
```
1 -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks another edge scenario with two slimes. The second slime cannot be eaten, and the first slime can be eaten by the second slime in one second.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
1 10 2
```
**Output**: 
```
1 -1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the middle slime is much larger than its neighbors. The middle slime cannot be eaten, and the other two slimes can be eaten by the middle slime in one second.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
3
10 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where the first slime is much larger than its neighbors. The first slime cannot be eaten, and the other two slimes can be eaten by the first slime in one second.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 300000
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with a strictly increasing sequence. The last slime cannot be eaten, and each other slime can be eaten by its right neighbor in one second.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
300000 299999 299998 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with a strictly decreasing sequence. The first slime cannot be eaten, and each other slime can be eaten by its left neighbor in one second.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ... -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) where all slimes have the same size. No slime can eat another, so all outputs are -1.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 2 1 2 1 2 ... 1 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with an alternating pattern of sizes. Each slime can be eaten by its neighbor in one second.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 ... 1 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 -1 1 -1 1 ... 1 -1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with a pattern where every second slime is much larger. The larger slimes cannot be eaten, and the smaller slimes can be eaten by the larger slimes in one second.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 ... 1 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
-1 1 -1 1 -1 ... 1 -1 1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with a pattern where every second slime is much smaller. The smaller slimes cannot be eaten, and the larger slimes can be eaten by the smaller slimes in one second.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 300000 299999 299998 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with a sequence that first increases and then decreases. The last slime cannot be eaten, and each other slime can be eaten by its neighbor in one second.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
300000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1

**Output**: 
```
-1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ... -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 ... -1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the maximum input size (300,000 slimes) with a sequence where all slimes have the same size. No slime can eat another, so all outputs are -1.
