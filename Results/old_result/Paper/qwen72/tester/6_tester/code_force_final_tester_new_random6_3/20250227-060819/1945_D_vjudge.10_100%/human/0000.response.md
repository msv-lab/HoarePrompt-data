Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
**Output**: 
```
14
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 4 people and wants to be among the first 2. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 2, which costs 3 (for position 2) + 8 (for position 3) = 14 coins.

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
6 2
6 9 7 1 8 3
5 8 8 1 4 1
```
**Output**: 
```
22
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 6 people and wants to be among the first 2. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 2, which costs 3 (for position 2) + 8 (for position 3) + 1 (for position 4) + 4 (for position 5) = 22 coins.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
**Output**: 
```
9
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 7 people and wants to be among the first 7. Since he is already within the acceptable range, he doesn't need to move and thus spends 0 coins. However, the problem specifies that he must move, so the minimum cost is 9 (for position 7).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
2 1
2 3
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 2 people and wants to be the first. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 1, which costs 2 (for position 1) = 3 coins.

```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 100,000 people and wants to be the first. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 1, which costs 1,000,000,000 coins.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 1
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
20000000000
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 200,000 people and wants to be the first. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 1, which costs the sum of all `b_i` values from position 1 to 200,000.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000 200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
20000000000
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 200,000 people and wants to be among the first 200,000. Since he is already within the acceptable range, he doesn't need to move and thus spends 0 coins. However, the problem specifies that he must move, so the minimum cost is the sum of all `b_i` values from position 1 to 200,000.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```

2 2
1 2
1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 2 people and wants to be among the first 2. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 2, which costs 2 coins.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```

200000 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
200000
```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 200,000 people and wants to be the first. All `a_i` and `b_i` values are 1. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 1, which costs the sum of all `b_i` values from position 1 to 200,000, which is 200,000 coins.

# Test 11

**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 200,000 people and wants to be among the first 200,000. All `a_i` and `b_i` values are 1,000,000,000. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 200,000, which costs the sum of all `b_i` values from position 1 to 200,000, which is 200,000 * 1,000,000,000 = 200,000,000,000,000 coins.

```
**Scenario**: Kirill is at the end of a queue of 200,000 people and wants to be the first. The `a_i` values are in ascending order, and the `b_i` values are in descending order. The optimal strategy involves moving to position 1, which costs the sum of all `b_i` values from position 1 to 200,000, which is 200,001,000,000 coins.
