### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 3 1 1
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The only row has no depth, so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2 for the two mandatory supports.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
100 3 100 1
0 0 0
0 0 0
...
0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
200
```
**Explanation**: Each row has only two mandatory supports, and the cost for each support is 1. Therefore, the total cost is 100 * 2 = 200.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 200000 1 100000
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Explanation**: The only row has a very large number of columns, and the maximum distance between supports is 100000. The optimal solution is to place supports at the river banks and every 100000 columns in between, resulting in a total cost of 200000.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 1 1
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
...
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
20000000
```
**Explanation**: Each row has a very large number of columns, and the maximum distance between supports is 1. The optimal solution is to place supports at every column, resulting in a total cost of 100 * 200000 = 20000000.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 3 2 1
0 1 0
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: Both rows have the same depth, and the maximum distance between supports is 1. The optimal solution is to place supports at every column, resulting in a total cost of 2 * (1 + 1 + 1) = 6.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 100 200000
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
...
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
20000000
```
**Explanation**: Each row has a very large number of columns, and the maximum distance between supports is 200000. The optimal solution is to place supports at the river banks, resulting in a total cost of 100 * 200000 = 20000000.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 1 1
0 1000000 1000000 ... 1000000 1000000 0
0 1000000 1000000 ... 1000000 1000000 0
...
0 1000000 1000000 ... 1000000 1000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
200000000000
```
**Explanation**: Each row has a very large number of columns with a high depth, and the maximum distance between supports is 1. The optimal solution is to place supports at every column, resulting in a total cost of 100 * 200000 * 1000001 = 200000000000.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 3 1 1
0 1000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
2000002
```
**Explanation**: The only row has a very high depth in the middle column, and the maximum distance between supports is 1. The optimal solution is to place supports at every column, resulting in a total cost of 1 + 1000001 + 1 = 2000002.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 1 200000
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0

...
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
20000000
```
**Explanation**: Each row has a very large number of columns, and the maximum distance between supports is 200000. The optimal solution is to place supports at the river banks, resulting in a total cost of 100 * 200000 = 20000000.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
1 200000 1 1
0 1 1 1 ... 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
200000
```
**Explanation**: The only row has a very large number of columns with
