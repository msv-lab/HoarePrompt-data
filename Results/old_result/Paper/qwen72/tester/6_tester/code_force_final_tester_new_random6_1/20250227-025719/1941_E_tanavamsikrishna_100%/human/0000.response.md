Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1: Single Bridge with Simple Grid
**Input**:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal row to build the bridge is the first row. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + (1+1) + 0 = 4\).

#### Test 2: Multiple Bridges with Simple Grid
**Input**:
```
1
4 6 2 2
0 1 2 1 2 0
0 2 1 2 1 0
0 1 2 1 2 0
0 2 1 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
8
```
**Explanation**: The optimal rows to build the bridges are the first and second rows. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + (1+1) + 0\) for the first row and \(0 + (2+1) + (1+1) + (2+1) + 0\) for the second row, totaling 8.

#### Test 3: Multiple Bridges with Larger Grid
**Input**:
```
1
5 7 2 3
0 1 2 3 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 0
0 2 1 2 1 2 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The optimal rows to build the bridges are the first and third rows. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + (3+1) + (2+1) + 0\) for the first row and \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + (3+1) + (2+1) + 0\) for the third row, totaling 10.

#### Test 4: Single Bridge with Uniform Depth
**Input**:
```
1
2 5 1 1
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 1 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal row to build the bridge is either the first or second row. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + (1+1) + (1+1) + 0 = 4\).

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 5: Minimum Grid Size
**Input**:
```
1
1 3 1 1
0 1 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The grid is the smallest possible size. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + 0 = 2\).

#### Test 6: Maximum Grid Size
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 1 199999
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
...
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
399998
```
**Explanation**: The grid is at the maximum size, and the optimal row to build the bridge is any row. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + ... + (199999+1) + 0 = 399998\).

#### Test 7: Maximum Number of Bridges
**Input**:
```
1
100 200000 100 1
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
...
0 1 2 3 ... 199998 199999 0
```
**Output**:
```
39999800
```
**Explanation**: The maximum number of bridges (100) are built on consecutive rows. The cost for each row is \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + ... + (199999+1) + 0 = 399998\), and for 100 rows, the total cost is \(399998 \times 100 = 39999800\).

#### Test 8: Maximum Distance Between Supports
**Input**:
```
1
4 5 2 4
0 1 2 3 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 3 2 1 0
0 4 3 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The maximum distance between supports is 4, so the optimal rows to build the bridges are the first and second rows. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + 0\) for the first row and \(0 + (2+1) + 0\) for the second row, totaling 4.

#### Test 9: Minimum Distance Between Supports
**Input**:
```
1
4 5 2 1
0 1 2 3 0
0 2 1 2 0
0 3 2 1 0
0 4 3 2 0
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The minimum distance between supports is 1, so the optimal rows to build the bridges are the first and second rows. The cost is \(0 + (1+1) + (2+1) + (3+1) + 0\) for the first row and \(0 + (2+1) + (1+1) + (2+1) + 0\) for the second row, totaling 10.

#### Test 10: All Depths are Zero
**Input**:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: All depths are zero, so the cost is \(0 + (0+1) + (0+1) + 0 = 2\) for any row.

#### Test 11: All Depths are Maximum
**Input**:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1000000 1000000 1000000 0
0 1000000 1000000 1000000 0
0 1000000 1000000 1000000 0
```
**Output**:
```
3000002
```
**Explanation**: All depths are the maximum possible value, so the cost is \(0 + (1000000+1) + (1000000+1) + (1000000+1) + 0 = 3000002\) for any row.

#### Test 12: Multiple Test Cases
**Input**:
