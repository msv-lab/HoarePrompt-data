998001
```
**Scenario**: A 1000x1000 chessboard with 1 initial move on the diagonal. The initial move is (500, 500), and the computer skips its turn. The test checks the number of valid final configurations, which is the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining 999x999 grid.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
998001
```
**Scenario**: A 1000x1000 chessboard with no initial moves. The test checks the number of valid final configurations, which is the number of ways to place rooks in the entire 1000x1000 grid.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 1
150000 150000
```
**Output**: 
```
89999900000
```
**Scenario**: A 300000x300000 chessboard with 1 initial move on the diagonal. The initial move is (150000, 150000), and the computer skips its turn. The test checks the number of valid final configurations, which is the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining 299999x299999 grid. Note that the output is modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 0
```
**Output**: 
```
89999900000
```
**Scenario**: A 300000x300000 chessboard with no initial moves. The test checks the number of valid final configurations, which is the number of ways to place rooks in the entire 300000x300000 grid. Note that the output is modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 12
