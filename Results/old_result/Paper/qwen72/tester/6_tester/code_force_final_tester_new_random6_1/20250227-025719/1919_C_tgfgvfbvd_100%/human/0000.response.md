Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` can be split into `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 2` (since `2 < 4` and `4 < 5`).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 1` (since `1 < 3`).
- The total penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 2 + 1 = 3`.

# Test 2
**Input**:

```
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a = [8, 2, 3, 1, 1, 7, 4, 3]` can be split into `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 0` (no elements are in increasing order).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 1` (since `1 < 7`).
- The total penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
5
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]` can be split into `s = []` and `t = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 0` (since `s` is empty).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 0` (no elements are in increasing order).
- The total penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
5
1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a = [1]` can be split into `s = []` and `t = [1]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 0` (since `s` is empty).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 0` (since `t` has only one element).
- The total penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
5
2
2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a = [2, 1]` can be split into `s = [2]` and `t = [1]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `p(s) = 0` (since `s` has only one element).
- The penalty for `t` is `p(t) = 0` (since `t` has only one element).
- The total penalty is `p(s) + p(t) = 0 + 0 = 0`.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a` is a sequence of numbers from 1 to 200000.
- The optimal split is to keep all elements in one subsequence, as splitting would only increase the penalty.
- The penalty for the entire array is `p(a) = 199999` (since every consecutive pair is in increasing order).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
200000 199999 199998 199997 ... 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a` is a sequence of numbers from 200000 to 1.
- The optimal split is to keep all elements in one subsequence, as splitting would only increase the penalty.
- The penalty for the entire array is `p(a) = 0` (since no consecutive pair is in increasing order).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- The array `a` consists of all 1s.
- The optimal split is to keep all elements in one subsequence, as splitting would only increase the penalty.

**Explanation**: 
- The array `a` is a sequence of numbers from 10 to 1.
- The optimal split is to keep all elements in one subsequence, as splitting would only increase the penalty.
- The penalty for the entire array is `p(a) = 0` (since no consecutive pair is in increasing order).
