**Explanation**: For a 3x3 board with no initial moves, the possible final configurations are:
1. (1,1), (2,2), (3,3)
2. (1,1), (2,3), (3,2)
3. (1,2), (2,1), (3,3)
4. (1,2), (2,3), (3,1)
5. (1,3), (2,1), (3,2)

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
5 2
1 2
3 4
```
**Output**:
```
12
```
**Explanation**: After the initial moves, the board has:
- White rook at (1,2) and black rook at (2,1)
- White rook at (3,4) and black rook at (4,3)
The remaining valid moves and their mirrored counterparts can result in 12 different configurations.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
6 1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
20
```
**Explanation**: After the initial move, the board has a white rook at (1,1) and the computer skips its turn. The remaining valid moves and their mirrored counterparts can result in 20 different configurations.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
1 0
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 1x1 board with no initial moves, the only possible configuration is placing one rook (either white or black).

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 2x2 board with one initial move, the board has:
- White rook at (1,2) and black rook at (2,1)
No more valid moves can be made, so there is only one configuration.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
3 3
1 2
2 3
3 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 3x3 board with three initial moves, the board has:
- White rook at (1,2) and black rook at (2,1)
- White rook at (2,3) and black rook at (3,2)
- White rook at (3,1) and black rook at (1,3)
No more valid moves can be made, so there is only one configuration.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000 0
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: For a 1000x1000 board with no initial moves, the number of possible configurations is very large, but we need to print it modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
300000 1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
899999999
```
**Explanation**: For a 300000x300000 board with one initial move, the board has:
- White rook at (1,1) and the computer skips its turn
The number of possible configurations is very large, but we need to print it modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1000 1000
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
1000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: For a 1000x1000 board with 1000 initial moves, the board is almost full, and no more valid moves can be made, so there is only one configuration.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1000 500
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
500 501
```
**Output**:
```
1000000000
```
**Explanation**: For a 1000x1000 board with 500 initial moves, the number of possible configurations is still very large, but we need to print it modulo 10^9+7.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
1000 1
1 1000
```
**Output**:
```
999999999
```
**Explanation**: For a 1000x1000 board with one initial move, the board has:
- White rook at (1,1000) and the computer skips its turn
The number of possible configurations is very large, but we need to print it modulo 10^9+7.
