Certainly! Below is a comprehensive set of test cases for the given problem. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
10
```
**Output**: 
```
5
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a small, even number. The expected output is 5 because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 10\).

# Test 2
**Input**: 
```
1
7
```
**Output**: 
```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a small, prime number. The expected output is 6 because \(\gcd(7, 6) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 7\).

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
21
```
**Output**: 
```
18
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a small, composite number. The expected output is 18 because \(\gcd(21, 18) + 18 = 3 + 18 = 21\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 21\).

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
100
```
**Output**: 
```
98
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a larger, even number. The expected output is 98 because \(\gcd(100, 98) + 98 = 2 + 98 = 100\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 100\).

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
6
```
**Output**: 
```
3
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the basic functionality with a small, even number. The expected output is 3 because \(\gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 6\).

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
2
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge condition with the smallest possible input. The expected output is 1 because \(\gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 2\).

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1000
```
**Output**: 
```
750
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge condition with the largest possible input. The expected output is 750 because \(\gcd(1000, 750) + 750 = 250 + 750 = 1000\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 1000\).

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1001
```
**Output**: 
```
1000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior just above the upper limit of the input range. The expected output is 1000 because \(\gcd(1001, 1000) + 1000 = 1 + 1000 = 1001\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 1001\).

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge condition with the smallest composite number. The expected output is 2 because \(\gcd(3, 2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 3\).

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
999
```
**Output**: 
```
998
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the edge condition with a large, odd number. The expected output is 998 because \(\gcd(999, 998) + 998 = 1 + 998 = 999\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 999\).

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior with a very large input to ensure the function can handle large numbers efficiently. The expected output is 999999999 because \(\gcd(1000000000, 999999999) + 999999999 = 1 + 999999999 = 1000000000\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 1000000000\).

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior just above the upper limit of the input range with a very large number. The expected output is 1000000000 because \(\gcd(1000000001, 1000000000) + 1000000000 = 1 + 1000000000 = 1000000001\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 1000000001\).

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
999999999999
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior with an extremely large input to ensure the function can handle such large numbers without performance issues. The expected output is 999999999999 because \(\gcd(1000000000000, 999999999999) + 999999999999 = 1 + 999999999999 = 1000000000000\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 1000000000000\).

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
1000000000001
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000000
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the behavior just above the upper limit of the input range with an extremely large number. The expected output is 1000000000000 because \(\gcd(1000000000001, 1000000000000) + 1000000000000 = 1 + 1000000000000 = 1000000000001\), which is the maximum possible value for \(y < 1000000000001\).
