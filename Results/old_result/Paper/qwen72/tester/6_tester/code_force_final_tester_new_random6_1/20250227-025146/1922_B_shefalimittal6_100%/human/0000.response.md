Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
4
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
35
```
**Explanation**: Any three sticks out of the seven can be chosen, and they will all form a non-degenerate triangle because all lengths are the same (2^1 = 2).

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
4
3 2 1 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The valid combinations are (1, 2, 4) and (1, 3, 4).

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The lengths are 2, 4, and 8, and no three of these can form a non-degenerate triangle.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Only one stick is given, so it's impossible to form a triangle.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
5
0 1 2 3 4
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The only valid combination is (1, 2, 4).

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
300000
0 0 0 ... 0 (300000 times)
```
**Output**:
```
49999750000000
```
**Explanation**: All sticks have the same length (2^0 = 1), and the number of ways to choose 3 sticks out of 300000 is \(\binom{300000}{3}\).

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
300000
1 2 3 ... 300000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: Each stick has a unique length, and no three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle because the lengths are 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^300000.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
10000
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
0
...
0 (10000 times)
```
**Explanation**: Each test case has only one stick, so no triangles can be formed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
2
2
1 1
3
1 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
1
```
**Explanation**: 
- In the first test case, only two sticks are given, so no triangle can be formed.
- In the second test case, the valid combination is (2, 2, 4).
