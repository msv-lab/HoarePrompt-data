It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description. The function `has_close_elements` is not mentioned, and the problem is about a game between Alice and Bob with their wallets. I will provide the test cases for the game as described.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the minimum number of coins (1). This tests the base case where the game ends immediately after the first move.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins (10^9) and the other has the minimum (1). This tests the scenario where one player has a significantly larger number of coins.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 7, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the second player has a significantly larger number of coins.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the maximum number of coins (10^9). This tests the scenario where both players have the same large number of coins.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with a small number of coins (2). This tests the scenario where both players have the same small number of coins.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins (10^9) and the other has one less (10^9 - 1). This tests the scenario where the difference in coins is minimal but significant.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
999999999 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 11, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the second player has one less coin.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the minimum number of coins (1) and the other has the maximum (10^9). This tests the scenario where the difference in coins is maximized.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 13, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the first player has the maximum number of coins.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins (10^9) and the other has a very small number of coins (2). This tests the scenario where the second player has a small but non-minimal number of coins.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
2 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 15, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the first player has a small but non-minimal number of coins.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 3
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins (10^9) and the other has a small number of coins (3). This tests the scenario where the second player has a small but non-minimal number of coins.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
3 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 17, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the first player has a small but non-minimal number of coins.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players have the maximum number of coins (10^9). This tests the scenario where both players have the same large number of coins, ensuring the function handles large inputs correctly.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999998
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins (10^9) and the other has a very close but smaller number of coins (10^9 - 2). This tests the scenario where the difference in coins is very small but still significant.

# Test 21
**Input**:
```
1
999999998 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 20, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the second player has a very close but smaller number of coins.

# Test 22
**Input**:
```
1
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the minimum number of coins (1) and the other has a small number of coins (2). This tests the scenario where the difference in coins is minimal but still significant.

# Test 23
**Input**:
```
1
2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 22, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the first player has a small but non-minimal number of coins.

# Test 24
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1000000001
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: One player has the maximum number of coins (10^9) and the other has one more coin (10^9 + 1). This tests the scenario where the difference in coins is minimal but still significant.

# Test 25
**Input**:
```
1
1000000001 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Similar to Test 24, but with the roles reversed. This ensures the function handles the case where the first player has one more coin.

# Test 26
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000001
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: One player has the minimum number of coins (1) and the other has the maximum plus
