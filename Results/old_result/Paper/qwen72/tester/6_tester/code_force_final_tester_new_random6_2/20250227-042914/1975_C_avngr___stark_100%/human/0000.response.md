7
1 2 3 4 5 6 7
```
**Output**: 
```
1
4
```
**Scenario**: The first array is a uniform array, so no operations are needed. The second array has seven elements, and the median of the entire array is 4, testing the function's ability to handle odd-length arrays.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```

10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
5
5
```
**Scenario**: The first array is in ascending order, and the second array is in descending order. Both have ten elements, and the median of the entire array is 5, testing the function's ability to handle sorted arrays in different orders.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
2
5
1 2 2 3 4
4
1 3 3 2
```
**Output**: 
```
2
3
```
**Scenario**: The first array has a repeated median value, and the second array has repeated elements but a different median. This tests the function's ability to handle arrays with repeated elements.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
2
5
1 1 2 2 3
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
2
2
```
**Scenario**: Both arrays have repeated elements, and the median is 2. This tests the function's ability to handle arrays with multiple repeated elements and different lengths.

50
```
**Scenario**: The first array is in ascending order with 100,000 elements, and the second array is in descending order with 100,000 elements. Both arrays have a median of 50, testing the function's ability to handle the maximum allowed input size.
