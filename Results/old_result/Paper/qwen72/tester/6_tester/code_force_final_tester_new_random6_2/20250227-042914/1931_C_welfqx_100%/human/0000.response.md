Sure, here are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem:

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
8
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 2, j = 5, and x = 1. The cost is (5 - 2 + 1) = 4 burles.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
8
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already equal, so no operation is needed.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
8
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 4, j = 5, and x = 8. The cost is (5 - 4 + 1) = 2 burles.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
8
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so it is already equal.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
8
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 2, and x = 1. The cost is (2 - 1 + 1) = 1 burle.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
8
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 3, and x = 1. The cost is (3 - 1 + 1) = 3 burles. However, selecting i = 2, j = 3, and x = 2 is more optimal with a cost of (3 - 2 + 1) = 2 burles.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
8
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 200000
```
**Output**:
```
199999
```
**Explanation**: The array has 200,000 elements, and the optimal solution is to select i = 1, j = 200000, and x = 1. The cost is (200000 - 1 + 1) = 200000 burles. However, since the problem states that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 200,000, this test case is not feasible. Instead, we can use a smaller array to simulate a large array:
```
8
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
10
```

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
8
10
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already equal, so no operation is needed.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
8
10
1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 2, j = 10, and x = 2. The cost is (10 - 2 + 1) = 9 burles. However, selecting i = 1, j = 1, and x = 2 is more optimal with a cost of (1 - 1 + 1) = 1 burle.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
8
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 1. The cost is (10 - 1 + 1) = 10 burles. However, selecting i = 1, j = 5, and x = 1, then i = 6, j = 10, and x = 1 is more optimal with a total cost of 5 + 5 = 10 burles. The optimal single operation is selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 1.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
8
10
1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 5, and x = 5, then i = 6, j = 10, and x = 5. The total cost is 5 + 5 = 10 burles. However, the optimal single operation is selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 5 with a cost of 10 burles.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
8
10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 1. The cost is (10 - 1 + 1) = 10 burles.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
8
10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**:
```
10
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 10. The cost is (10 - 1 + 1) = 10 burles.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
8
10
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
5
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 5, and x = 1, then i = 6, j = 10, and x = 1. The total cost is 5 + 5 = 10 burles. However, the optimal single operation is selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 1 with a cost of 10 burles.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```

```
6
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 5, and x = 1, then i = 6, j = 10, and x = 1. The total cost is 5 + 5 = 10 burles. However, the optimal single operation is selecting i = 1, j = 10, and x = 1 with a cost of 10 burles. Alternatively, selecting i = 6, j = 10, and x = 1, then i = 1, j = 5, and x = 1 is more optimal with a total cost of 5 + 1 = 6 burles.
