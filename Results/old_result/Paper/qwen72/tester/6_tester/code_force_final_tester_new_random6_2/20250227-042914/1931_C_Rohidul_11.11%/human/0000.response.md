Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
8
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 2, j = 5, and x = 1, which costs (5 - 2 + 1) = 4 burles.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
8
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already equal, so no operation is needed.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```

8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 4, j = 5, and x = 8, which costs (5 - 4 + 1) = 2 burles.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
8
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already equal, so no operation is needed.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
8
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 2, and x = 1, which costs (2 - 1 + 1) = 1 burle.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
8
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The array can be made equal by selecting i = 1, j = 3, and x = 1, which costs (3 - 1 + 1) = 3 burles. However, selecting i = 2, j = 3, and x = 2 costs (3 - 2 + 1) = 2 burles, which is the minimum.
