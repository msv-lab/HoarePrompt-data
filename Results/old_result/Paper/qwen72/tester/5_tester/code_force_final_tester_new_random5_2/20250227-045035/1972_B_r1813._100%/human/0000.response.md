**Input**: 
```
1
7
UDDUUDD
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a longer sequence with an imbalance of up and down coins.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
8
UUDDUUDD
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a longer sequence with a balanced number of up and down coins but in a different pattern.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1
U
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario with only one coin facing up. Alice wins by default as Bob has no move.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
1
D
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario with only one coin facing down. Alice loses as there are no facing-up coins to choose from.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
2
UD
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario with two coins, one facing up and one facing down. Alice can remove the up coin and flip the down coin, leaving Bob with no move.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
2
DU
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario with two coins, one facing down and one facing up. Alice can remove the up coin and flip the down coin, leaving Bob with no move.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
100
UDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUUDDUU
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario with the maximum number of coins (100) in a repeating pattern. It ensures the function can handle the largest input size.
