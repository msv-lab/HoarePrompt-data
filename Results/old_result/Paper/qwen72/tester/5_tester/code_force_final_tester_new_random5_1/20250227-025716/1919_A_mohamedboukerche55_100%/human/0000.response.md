# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```

2 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 2 coins and Bob with 1. Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping wallets.

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with the maximum number of coins (1000000000) and Bob with 1. Alice can force Bob to lose by swapping wallets.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
1 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Alice starts with 1 coin and Bob with the maximum number of coins (1000000000). Alice cannot make a move after the first turn, so Bob wins.

```
**Output**:
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: Both players start with the maximum number of coins (1000000000). The game will end in a draw, but since the problem states that the player who cannot make a move loses, Bob wins.
