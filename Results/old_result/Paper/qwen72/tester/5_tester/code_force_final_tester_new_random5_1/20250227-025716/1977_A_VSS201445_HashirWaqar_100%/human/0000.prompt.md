**Role**: As a tester, your task is to create comprehensive test cases for the following coding problem. These test cases should encompass Basic and Edge scenarios to ensure the code's robustness, reliability, and scalability.

**Problem Description**:
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) â€” the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

**1. Basic Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To verify the fundamental functionality of the `has_close_elements` function under normal conditions.

**2. Edge Test Cases**:
- **Objective**: To evaluate the function's behavior under extreme or unusual conditions.

**Instructions**:
- Implement a comprehensive set of test cases following the guidelines above.
- Ensure each test case is complete (no omission) and well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.
- Pay special attention to edge cases as they often reveal hidden bugs.
- Do not repeat, do not summarize.

All test cases you give need to strictly follow the problem description and format like this:
# Test 1
**Input**: 
```

```
**Output**: 
```

```
