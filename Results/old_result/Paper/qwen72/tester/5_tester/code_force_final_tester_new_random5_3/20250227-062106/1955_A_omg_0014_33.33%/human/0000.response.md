```
1
100 1 2
```
**Output**:
```
100
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the scenario where the promotion price is exactly double the regular price for one yogurt, but with the maximum number of yogurts.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
100 15 29
```
**Output**:
```
750
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the scenario where the promotion price is just below the double of the regular price, with the maximum number of yogurts.

**Input**:
```
1
100 15 30
```
**Output**:
```
750
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the scenario where the promotion price is exactly double the regular price, with the maximum number of yogurts.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
100 15 31
```
