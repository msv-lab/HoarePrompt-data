# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
2 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
100 50
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Tests the case where the number of moves is 100, and the target cubes are 50, which is achievable by adding 50 cubes and removing 50 cubes.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
101 50
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Tests the case where the number of moves is 101, and the target cubes are 50, which is impossible to achieve because the parity of moves and target cubes does not match.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
50 101
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Tests the case where the number of moves is 50, and the target cubes are 101, which is impossible to achieve because the number of moves is less than the target cubes.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
100 99
```
**Output**: 
```
Yes
```
**Scenario**: Tests the case where the number of moves is 100, and the target cubes are 99, which is achievable by adding 99 cubes and removing 1 cube.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
99 100
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Tests the case where the number of moves is 99, and the target cubes are 100, which is impossible to achieve because the number of moves is less than the target cubes.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
0 0
```
**Output**: 
```
No
```
**Scenario**: Tests the case where both the number of moves and target cubes are 0, which is not a valid input according to the problem constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100).
