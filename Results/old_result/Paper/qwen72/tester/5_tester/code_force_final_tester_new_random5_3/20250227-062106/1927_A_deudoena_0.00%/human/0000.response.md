```
10
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip of length 10 with alternating black and white cells, starting with a black cell.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
10
BWWWWWWWWW
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with a single black cell at the beginning.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
10
WWWWWWWWWWB

```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with black cells distributed in a non-continuous manner, ensuring the function can handle multiple segments of black cells.

# Test 13

```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with black cells distributed in a non-continuous manner, starting with a black cell.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
10
BWWBWWBWWW
```
**Output**:
```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with black cells distributed in a non-continuous manner, ending with white cells.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
10
WWBWWBWWBW
```
**Output**:
```

```
6
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with black cells distributed in a non-continuous manner, but the length exceeds the maximum allowed (10). This is a theoretical edge case to ensure the function handles input validation correctly.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
10
BWWBWWBWWB
```
**Output**:
```
7
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers a strip with black cells distributed in a non-continuous manner, ensuring the function can handle multiple segments of black cells.
