Certainly! Below are the comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
**Output**:
```
4
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to select i = 2, j = 5, and x = 1, which costs (5 - 2 + 1) = 4 burles. The array becomes [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1].

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array is already uniform, so no operation is needed.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to select i = 4, j = 5, and x = 8, which costs (5 - 4 + 1) = 2 burles. The array becomes [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8].

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: The array has only one element, so it is already uniform.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to select i = 1, j = 2, and x = 1, which costs (2 - 1 + 1) = 1 burle. The array becomes [1, 1].

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The optimal operation is to select i = 1, j = 3, and x = 1, which costs (3 - 1 + 1) = 3 burles. However, a better choice is to select i = 2, j = 3, and x = 1, which costs (3 - 2 + 1) = 2 burles. The array becomes [1, 1, 1].
