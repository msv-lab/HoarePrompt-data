Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**: 
```
1
1
43
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Single container with a non-zero amount of water. Since there's only one container, the condition is trivially satisfied.

**Input**: 
```
1
2
1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: Two containers with different amounts of water. It is impossible to make them equal since the only allowed operation is pouring from the left to the right.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
1
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
```
**Scenario**: Five containers with varying amounts of water. It is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by performing the operations as described in the problem note.

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
3
