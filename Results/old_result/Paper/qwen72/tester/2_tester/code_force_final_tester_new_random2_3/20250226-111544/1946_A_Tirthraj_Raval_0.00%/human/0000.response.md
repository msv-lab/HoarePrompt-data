Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the problem, covering both basic and edge scenarios. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

### Basic Test Cases

# Test 1
**Input**:
```
1
3
2 2 8
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2. By increasing the first element by 1, we get [3, 2, 8], and the median becomes 3.

# Test 2
**Input**:
```
1
4
7 3 3 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [7, 3, 3, 1] is 3. By increasing the second and third elements by 1, we get [7, 4, 4, 1], and the median becomes 4.

# Test 3
**Input**:
```
1
1
1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [1000000000] is 1000000000. By increasing the only element by 1, we get [1000000001], and the median becomes 1000000001.

# Test 4
**Input**:
```
1
5
5 5 5 4 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5. By increasing the first, second, and third elements by 1, we get [6, 6, 6, 4, 5], and the median becomes 6.

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2. By increasing the first and third elements by 1, we get [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4], and the median becomes 3.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [1, 2] is 1. By increasing the first element by 1, we get [2, 2], and the median becomes 2.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
2
1 1
```
**Output**:
```
2
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [1, 1] is 1. By increasing both elements by 1, we get [2, 2], and the median becomes 2.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
4
5 5 5 5
```
**Output**:
```
3
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [5, 5, 5, 5] is 5. By increasing the first, second, and third elements by 1, we get [6, 6, 6, 5], and the median becomes 6.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 9
**Input**:
```
1
1
1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array [1] is 1. By increasing the only element by 1, we get [2], and the median becomes 2.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
100000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
```
**Output**:
```
50
```
**Explanation**: The median of the original array is 50.5 (since the array length is even, the median is the average of the 50th and 51st elements). By increasing the first 50 elements by 1, the median becomes 51.
