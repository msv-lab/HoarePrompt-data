Certainly! Below are comprehensive test cases for the given problem, including both basic and edge scenarios. Each test case is well-documented with comments explaining the scenario it covers.

### Basic Test Cases

#### Test 1
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a small permutation where the maximum XOR is straightforward to find.
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 1 3
? 0 3 1 2
! 3 2
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[0, 3, 1, 2]`.
- The first query checks `(p_0 | p_1) < (p_2 | p_3)`, which is `0 < 3`.
- The second query checks `(p_0 | p_2) < (p_1 | p_3)`, which is `1 < 3`.
- The third query checks `(p_0 | p_3) > (p_1 | p_2)`, which is `2 > 3`.
- The maximum XOR is `3` (from `2 ⊕ 1`), so the answer is `! 3 2`.

#### Test 2
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a small permutation where the maximum XOR is not immediately obvious.
**Input**:
```
1
4
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 1 2 0 3
? 1 3 0 2
! 1 0
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[1, 0, 3, 2]`.
- The first query checks `(p_0 | p_1) < (p_2 | p_3)`, which is `1 < 3`.
- The second query checks `(p_1 | p_2) > (p_0 | p_3)`, which is `3 > 3`.
- The third query checks `(p_1 | p_3) > (p_0 | p_2)`, which is `2 > 3`.
- The maximum XOR is `3` (from `1 ⊕ 0`), so the answer is `! 1 0`.

### Edge Test Cases

#### Test 3
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with the smallest possible permutation.
**Input**:
```
1
2
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 0 1 1
! 0 1
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[0, 1]` or `[1, 0]`.
- The only possible XOR is `1` (from `0 ⊕ 1`), so the answer is `! 0 1`.

#### Test 4
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a large permutation where the maximum XOR is between the smallest and largest elements.
**Input**:
```
1
10
```
**Output**:

? 0 2 3 4
? 0 3 4 5
? 0 4 5 6
? 0 5 6 7
? 0 6 7 8
? 0 7 8 9
? 0 8 9 1
? 0 9 1 2
! 0 9
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.
- The maximum XOR is `9` (from `0 ⊕ 9`), so the answer is `! 0 9`.

#### Test 5
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a permutation where all elements are the same except for one.
**Input**:
```
1
5
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 3 4
? 0 3 4 1
? 0 4 1 2
! 0 4
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The maximum XOR is `4` (from `0 ⊕ 4`), so the answer is `! 0 4`.

#### Test 6
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a permutation where the maximum XOR is between two elements that are not the smallest or largest.
**Input**:
```
1
6
```
**Output**:
```
? 0 1 2 3
? 0 2 3 4
? 0 3 4 5
? 0 4 5 1
? 0 5 1 2
? 1 2 3 4
? 1 3 4 5
? 1 4 5 2
? 1 5 2 3
! 1 4
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0]`.
- The maximum XOR is `7` (from `2 ⊕ 5`), so the answer is `! 1 4`.

#### Test 7
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a permutation where the maximum XOR is between two elements that are adjacent in the permutation.
**Input**:
```
1

? 1 2 3 0
? 2 3 0 1
? 3 0 1 2
! 1 2
```
**Explanation**:
- The hidden permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 0]`.
- The maximum XOR is `3` (from `2 ⊕ 1`), so the answer is `! 1 2`.

#### Test 8
**Objective**: Verify the functionality with a permutation where the maximum XOR is between two elements that are far apart in the permutation.
**Input**:
```
