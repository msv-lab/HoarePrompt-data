2
1 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario where one pile has the minimum possible number of stones (1) and the other has the maximum possible number of stones. Alice must choose k=1, leaving Bob to win on the next turn.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 199999 200000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and a linearly increasing number of stones in each pile. It tests the function's performance and scalability.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and all piles having the minimum possible number of stones (1). Alice cannot make a move on her first turn, so Bob wins immediately.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and all piles having the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). Alice can win by removing all stones in one move.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 199999 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and a mix of stone counts, including a pile with the minimum possible number of stones (1) at the end. Alice must choose k=1, leaving Bob to win on the next turn.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 199999 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and a mix of stone counts, including a pile with the minimum possible number of stones (1) and another with the second smallest number of stones (2). Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and all but one pile having the minimum possible number of stones (1). The last pile has 2 stones. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ... 199999 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
Alice
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and a mix of stone counts, including a pile with the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000) at the end. Alice can win by choosing k=1 on her first turn.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
200000
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 ... 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
Bob
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers the edge scenario with the maximum number of piles (200,000) and all but one pile having the maximum possible number of stones (1,000,000,000). The last pile has 1 stone. Alice must choose k=1, leaving Bob to win on the next turn.

These test cases should provide a thorough evaluation of the function's ability to handle both basic and edge scenarios, ensuring its robustness, reliability, and scalability.
