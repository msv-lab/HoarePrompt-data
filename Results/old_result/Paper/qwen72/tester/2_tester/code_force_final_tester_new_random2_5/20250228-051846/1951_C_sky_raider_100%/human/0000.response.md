It seems there was a mix-up in the problem description and the function name. The problem is about purchasing concert tickets with specific constraints, not about the `has_close_elements` function. I will create test cases for the concert ticket problem as described.

### Basic Test Cases

6 3 9
5 5 5 5 5 5
```
**Output**: 
```
10
64

72
```

# Test 2

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1 1
1
```
**Output**: 
```
1
```
**Scenario**: Minimum possible values for n, m, and k. Only one day, one ticket, and one purchase.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
300000 1 300000
1 2 3 4 ... 300000
```
**Output**: 
```
45000000000
```
**Scenario**: Maximum possible value for n, with m = 1 and k = n. This tests the upper limit of n and ensures the function can handle large inputs efficiently.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1000000000 1000000000
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
1000000000
```
**Scenario**: Maximum possible value for k and m, with all ticket prices being the minimum. This tests the function's ability to handle very large values of k and m.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
1000000000 999999999 999999998 999999997 999999996 999999995 999999994 999999993 999999992 999999991
```
**Output**: 
```
9999999955
```
**Scenario**: Maximum possible value for k with m = 1, and very high ticket prices. This tests the function's ability to handle large sums and the constraint of buying only one ticket per day.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10000000000
```
**Scenario**: Mixed ticket prices with high and low values, and m = k. This tests the function's ability to handle mixed prices and the constraint of buying all tickets in one day.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: k is less than the total number of days, and m is greater than k. This tests the function's ability to handle scenarios where tickets can be bought over multiple days with varying prices.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 5
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
15
```
**Scenario**: k is less than the total number of days, and m = 1. This tests the function's ability to handle scenarios where tickets must be bought one at a time over multiple days.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
10 5 10
1000000000 999999999 999999998 999999997 999999996 999999995 999999994 999999993 999999992 999999991
```
**Output**: 
```
9999999955
```
**Scenario**: k is equal to the total number of days, and m is greater than k. This tests the function's ability to handle scenarios where tickets can be bought in large quantities but are spread over multiple days.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 100
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Scenario**: k is much larger than the number of days, and all ticket prices are the minimum. This tests the function's ability to handle scenarios where tickets are bought in large quantities over a few days.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 100
1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**: 
```
100000000000
```
**Scenario**: k is much larger than the number of days, and all ticket prices are the maximum. This tests the function's ability to handle scenarios where tickets are bought in large quantities over a few days with very high prices.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1 1000000000 1
```
**Output**: 
```
10000000010
```
**Scenario**: k is equal to the number of days, and ticket prices alternate between very high and very low. This tests the function's ability to handle mixed prices and the constraint of buying tickets over multiple days.

# Test 17
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
```
**Output**: 
```
100
```
**Scenario**: All ticket prices are the same, and k is equal to the number of days. This tests the function's ability to handle uniform prices and the constraint of buying tickets over multiple days.

# Test 18
**Input**: 
```
1
10 1 10
10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
**Output**: 
```
55
```
**Scenario**: k is equal to the number of days, and ticket prices are in descending order. This tests the function's ability to handle descending prices and the constraint of buying one ticket per day.

# Test 19
**Input**: 
```
1
10 10 10
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```
**Output**: 
```
