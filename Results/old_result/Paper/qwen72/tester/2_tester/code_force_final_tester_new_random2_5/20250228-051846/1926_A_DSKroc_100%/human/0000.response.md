**Input**: 
```
1
AAABB
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string where the most frequent character is at the end, ensuring the function can handle such patterns.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
ABABB
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string where the most frequent character is in the middle, ensuring the function can handle such patterns.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
ABABA
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string with a repeating pattern, ensuring the function can handle such patterns.

1
AABBB
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string where the most frequent character is not at the beginning or end, ensuring the function can handle such patterns.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
BBBAA
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string where the most frequent character is not at the beginning or end, ensuring the function can handle such patterns.

**Input**: 
```
1
ABABB
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string where the most frequent character is not at the beginning or end, ensuring the function can handle such patterns.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
AAAAA
```
**Output**: 
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string with the maximum possible length of 5, all characters being \texttt{A}, ensuring the function can handle the maximum length.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
BBBBB
```
**Output**: 
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes a string with the maximum possible length of 5, all characters being \texttt{B}, ensuring the function can handle the maximum length.
