```
1
3 2
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- For `n = 3` and `x = 2`, no value of `k` fits because the pattern does not allow `x = 2` at `n = 3`.

```
1
1000000000 1
```
**Output**:
```
1
```

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 999999999
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- For `n = 1000000000` and `x = 999999999`, no value of `k` fits because `x` is too close to `n`.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
1000000000 2
```
**Output**:
```
1
```
**Explanation**:

1
1000000000 1000000000
```
**Output**:
```
0
```
**Explanation**: 
- For `n = 1000000000` and `x = 1000000000`, no value of `k` fits because `x` cannot be equal to `n`.

# Test 10
