2 2
3 3
```
**Output**: 
```
abc
baab
abcabc
```
**Scenario**: This test case includes basic scenarios with `n` and `k` values that are slightly larger than the example but still manageable.

# Test 3
**Input**: 
```
2
1 5
2 4
```
**Output**: 
```
abcde
abcdabc
```
**Scenario**: This test case covers scenarios with a few more alphabets and longer strings to ensure the solution works for a broader range of inputs.

### Edge Test Cases

# Test 4
**Input**: 
```
1
1 1
```
**Output**: 
```
a
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the smallest possible input where `n` and `k` are both 1.

# Test 5
**Input**: 
```
1
26 1
```
**Output**: 
```
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where `n` is at its maximum (26) and `k` is 1, ensuring the output is a string of 26 'a's.

# Test 6
**Input**: 
```
1
26 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where both `n` and `k` are at their maximum (26), ensuring the output is a string that contains all possible subsequences of length 26 using all 26 alphabets.

# Test 7
**Input**: 
```
1
2 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where `n` is 2 and `k` is at its maximum (26), ensuring the output contains all possible 2-length subsequences using all 26 alphabets.

# Test 8
**Input**: 
```
1
1 26
```
**Output**: 
```
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where `n` is 1 and `k` is at its maximum (26), ensuring the output contains all 26 alphabets.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
1
26 2
```
**Output**: 
```
aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where `n` is at its maximum (26) and `k` is 2, ensuring the output contains all possible 26-length subsequences using the first 2 alphabets.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
13 2
```
**Output**: 
```
aabbccddeeffgghhiijjkkllmmnnooppqqrrssttuuvvwwxxyyzz
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks a scenario where `n` is a large value (13) and `k` is 2, ensuring the output is a string that contains all possible 13-length subsequences using the first 2 alphabets.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
26 3
```
**Output**:
