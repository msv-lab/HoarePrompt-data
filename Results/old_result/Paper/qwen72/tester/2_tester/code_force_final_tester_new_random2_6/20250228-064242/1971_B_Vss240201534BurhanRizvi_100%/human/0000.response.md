# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
1
a
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has the minimum length (1) and consists of a single character. The expected output is "NO" because it is impossible to rearrange a single character string to be different from itself.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
1
ab
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
ba
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has the minimum length (2) and consists of two distinct characters. The expected output is a rearranged string that is different from the input string.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
1
abc
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
cba
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 3 and all characters are distinct. The expected output is a rearranged string that is different from the input string.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
1
aabb
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
bbaa
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 4 and consists of two repeated characters. The expected output is a rearranged string that is different from the input string.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
1
aabbcc
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
ccbbaa
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 6 and consists of three repeated characters. The expected output is a rearranged string that is different from the input string.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
1
aabbccdd
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
ddccbbaa
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 8 and consists of four repeated characters. The expected output is a rearranged string that is different from the input string.

# Test 16
**Input**: 
```
1
aabbccdde
```
**Output**: 
```
YES
eddccbbaa
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 9 and consists of five repeated characters. The expected output is a rearranged string that is different from the input string.

# Test 17

aabbccddeeff
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 12, which is beyond the allowed length of 10. The expected output is "NO" because the input is invalid according to the problem constraints.

# Test 20
**Input**: 
```
1
aabbccddeeffgh
```
**Output**: 
```
NO
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the scenario where the input string has a length of 14, which is beyond the allowed length of 10. The expected output is "NO" because the input is invalid according to the problem constraints.

These test cases should cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure the code is robust, reliable, and scalable.
