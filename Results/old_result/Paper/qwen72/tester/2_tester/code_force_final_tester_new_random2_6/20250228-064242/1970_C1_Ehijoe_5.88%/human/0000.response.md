**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the minimum number of nodes (2 nodes). The stone starts at one of the leaves. Hermione wins by default as Ron has no valid moves.

**Input**: 
```
2 1
1 2
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the minimum number of nodes (2 nodes). The stone starts at the other leaf. Hermione wins by default as Ron has no valid moves.

1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the maximum number of nodes (10 nodes). The stone starts at one of the leaves. Hermione can always win by forcing Ron to move the stone to the other leaf.

# Test 9
**Input**: 
```
10 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
7 8
8 9
9 10
10
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the maximum number of nodes (10 nodes). The stone starts at the other leaf. Hermione can always win by forcing Ron to move the stone to the other leaf.

# Test 10
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
1
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000 nodes). The stone starts at one of the leaves. Hermione can always win by forcing Ron to move the stone to the other leaf. This test case evaluates the scalability of the solution.

# Test 11
**Input**: 
```
200000 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
199999 200000
200000
```
**Output**: 
```
Hermione
```
**Scenario**: Tree with the maximum number of nodes (200,000 nodes). The stone starts at the other leaf. Hermione can always win by forcing Ron to move the stone to the other leaf. This test case evaluates the scalability of the solution.

# Test 12
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
2
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Tree with 4 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. Ron can always win by moving the stone to one of the leaves.

# Test 13
**Input**: 
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
3
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Tree with 4 nodes and the stone starting at the other middle node. Ron can always win by moving the stone to one of the leaves.

# Test 14
**Input**: 
```
100 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
...
99 100
50
```
**Output**: 
```
Ron
```
**Scenario**: Tree with 100 nodes and the stone starting at the middle node. Ron can always win by moving the stone to one of the leaves. This test case evaluates the solution's performance with a larger but manageable tree.

# Test 15
**Input**: 
```
