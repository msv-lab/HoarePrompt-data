```
**Explanation**:
- The array `a` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- One possible optimal split is `s = [2, 4, 5]` and `t = [1, 3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `2` (since `2 < 4` and `4 < 5`).
- The penalty for `t` is `1` (since `1 < 3`).
- The total penalty is `2 + 1 = 3`.

# Test 2

- One possible optimal split is `s = [8, 3, 1]` and `t = [2, 1, 7, 4, 3]`.
- The penalty for `s` is `0` (since there are no increasing pairs).
- The penalty for `t` is `1` (since `1 < 7`).
- The total penalty is `0 + 1 = 1`.
