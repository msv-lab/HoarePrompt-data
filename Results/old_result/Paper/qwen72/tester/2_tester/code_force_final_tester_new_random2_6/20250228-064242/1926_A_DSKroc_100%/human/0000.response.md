### Edge Test Cases

# Test 5
**Input**:
```
1
AAAAA
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string that contains only \texttt{A} characters. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{A} as the most frequent character.

# Test 6
**Input**:
```
1
BBBBB
```
**Output**:
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string that contains only \texttt{B} characters. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{B} as the most frequent character.

# Test 7
**Input**:
```
1
ABABA
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string where \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are equally frequent. The problem description does not specify a tie-breaking rule, so the function should return \texttt{A} by default.

# Test 8
**Input**:
```
1
BBABA
```
**Output**:
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string where \texttt{B} is slightly more frequent than \texttt{A}. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{B} as the most frequent character.

**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with the maximum number of test cases (32). It includes a variety of strings to ensure the function can handle multiple test cases efficiently and correctly.

# Test 10
**Input**:
```
1
ABBBB
```
**Output**:
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string where \texttt{B} is significantly more frequent than \texttt{A}. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{B} as the most frequent character.

# Test 11
**Input**:
```
1
AAABB
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string where \texttt{A} is significantly more frequent than \texttt{B}. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{A} as the most frequent character.

# Test 12
**Input**:
```
1
AABBA
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string where \texttt{A} is slightly more frequent than \texttt{B}. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{A} as the most frequent character.

# Test 13
**Input**:
```
1
BBAAB
```
**Output**:
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string where \texttt{B} is slightly more frequent than \texttt{A}. It ensures that the function correctly identifies \texttt{B} as the most frequent character.

# Test 14
**Input**:
```
1
ABABABABAB
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string that is longer than the specified length (5). Although the problem specifies strings of length 5, this test case ensures that the function can handle unexpected input gracefully.

# Test 15
**Input**:
```
1
ABAB
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string that is shorter than the specified length (5). Although the problem specifies strings of length 5, this test case ensures that the function can handle unexpected input gracefully.

# Test 16
**Input**:
```
1
ABACD
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string that contains characters other than \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. Although the problem specifies strings of \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}, this test case ensures that the function can handle unexpected characters gracefully.

# Test 17
**Input**:
```
1
A
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a string of length 1. Although the problem specifies strings of length 5, this test case ensures that the function can handle very short strings gracefully.

# Test 18
**Input**:
```
1
BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
```
**Output**:
```
B
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a very long string of \texttt{B} characters. Although the problem specifies strings of length 5, this test case ensures that the function can handle very long strings gracefully.

# Test 19
**Input**:
```
1
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a very long string of \texttt{A} characters. Although the problem specifies strings of length 5, this test case ensures that the function can handle very long strings gracefully.

# Test 20
**Input**:
```
1
ABABABABABABABABABABABABABABABAB
```
**Output**:
```
A
```
**Scenario**: This test case checks the function with a very long string where \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are equally frequent. Although the problem specifies strings of length 5, this test case ensures that the function can handle very long strings with equal frequency of characters gracefully.

These test cases cover a wide range of scenarios to ensure the function's robustness, reliability, and scalability.
