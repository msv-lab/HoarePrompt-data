State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `_` is not relevant as it is a throwaway variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the throwaway variable `_`.
- The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 500 inclusive).
- The throwaway variable `_` is used to iterate over the range of `t` and does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
