Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of "01" and "10" transitions in the binary string. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of cuts required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the fact that we can have multiple "01" or "10" transitions without needing to cut the string at every transition.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify the positions where we can make cuts such that all "0"s come before all "1"s. This means we should look for the last occurrence of "0" and the first occurrence of "1". The number of cuts required will be one less than the number of "1"s from the start of the string up to the position of the last "0".

Here's how the corrected program would work:
1. Iterate through the string to find the last index of "0".
2. Count the number of "1"s from the start of the string up to the last index of "0".
3. The number of cuts required is one less than this count.

Now, let's evaluate the given program against this understanding:

- The program counts "01" and "10" transitions, which is not relevant to determining the minimum number of cuts.
- The logic for printing the result is incorrect because it doesn't reflect the actual minimum number of cuts needed.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
