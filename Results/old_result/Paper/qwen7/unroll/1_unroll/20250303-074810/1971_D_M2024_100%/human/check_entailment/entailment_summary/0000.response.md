Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.
2. The proposed solution counts the occurrences of "01" and "10" substrings.
3. If there are no "01" substrings, it correctly prints the count of "10" substrings plus one, which represents the number of pieces needed.
4. If there are "01" substrings, it incorrectly sums the counts of "01" and "10" substrings instead of considering the minimum number of cuts required.

For example, consider the string "1010". The program would count 2 "01" substrings and 2 "10" substrings, resulting in a total of 4 pieces, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 2 pieces ("10", "10").

Therefore, the logic in the current implementation is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
