You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()

        cut1 = 0
        
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':

            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)
        
    #State: Output State: The value printed by the program based on the input string `a` for each iteration, where `cut0` is the count of "01" substrings and `cut1` is the count of "10" substrings. If there are no "01" substrings, the output is `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, the output is `cut0 + cut1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two counters `cut0` and `cut1` are initialized to zero. These counters will be used to count the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' and vice versa.

3. **Counting Cuts:**
   - The program iterates through the string `a` from the start to the second last character.
   - If a '1' is followed by a '0', it increments `cut1`.
   - If a '0' is followed by a '1', it increments `cut0`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Pieces:**
   - After counting the cuts, the program checks if `cut0` is zero.
     - If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0's followed by '1's, so the string is already sorted. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1`.
     - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are '0's followed by '1's, and the minimum number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Counting Cuts:**
   - The logic for counting cuts is flawed. The program counts both '10' and '01' transitions but does not correctly handle the requirement to minimize the number of pieces.
   - The program should focus on finding the points where the transition from '0' to '1' happens, as this is the critical point for determining the minimum number of pieces.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '0'. The number of pieces required will be the position of the first '1' plus one (if there is at least one '1') or just 1 if there are no '1's.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        # Find the first occurrence of '1'
        first_one = a.find('1')
        # Find the last occurrence of '0'
        last_zero = a.rfind('0')
        
        if first_one == -1:  # No '1' found, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        elif last_zero == -1:  # No '0' found, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            # The number of pieces is the index of the first '1' plus one
            print(first_one + 1)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a logical flaw in how it counts and processes the cuts. The corrected approach focuses on finding the critical points ('0' to '1' transition) and calculates the minimum number of pieces accordingly.
