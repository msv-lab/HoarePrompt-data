Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop.**

This means that for each index `i` from 0 to n-2 in the list `prog_cities`, the value is determined as follows:
- If the difference between the coordinate of the city at index `i+1` and the city at index `i` is less than the difference between the coordinate of the city at index `i` and the city at index `i-1` (if available), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at index `i+1` and the city at index `i`.

The program returns this list `prog_cities`.
