Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The `func_1` function is supposed to determine the closest city for each city. However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It sets `prog_cities[i]` to `1` if the forward city is closer, otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the current city and the forward city. This does not correctly identify the closest city as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Incorrect Use of Prefix Sums**:
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated based on the incorrect values produced by `func_1`. These sums are used to compute the minimum cost of travel between two cities, but they are based on an incorrect assumption about the closest cities.

3. **Reversing Cities**:
   - The program reverses the list of cities and calculates `backward_cities`, but it doesn't properly handle the logic to determine the closest city in reverse order. This is unnecessary and complicates the solution without adding value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Identify the closest city for each city.
2. Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of travel between any two cities.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def closest_city(cities):
    n = len(cities)
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            closest[i] = 1  # The closest city to the first city is the second city
        elif i == n - 1:
            closest[i] = n - 2  # The closest city to the last city is the second-to-last city
        else:
            if cities[i + 1] - cities[i] <= cities[i] - cities[i - 1]:
                closest[i] = i + 1
            else:
                closest[i] = i - 1
    return closest

def min_cost_to_travel(cities, queries, closest):
    n = len(cities)
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = abs(cities[i] - cities[closest[i]])
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] += dp[i-1]
    
    m = len(queries)
    results = []
    for (x, y) in queries:
        if x < y:
            results.append(dp[y-1] - dp[x-1])
        else:
            results.append(dp[n-1] - dp[y-1] - (dp[x-1] - dp[n-y]))
    
    return results

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cities = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = int(input())
    queries = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
    
    closest = closest_city(cities)
    results = min_cost_to_travel(cities, queries, closest)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
```

This corrected program correctly identifies the closest city for each city and uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum cost of travel between any two cities.
