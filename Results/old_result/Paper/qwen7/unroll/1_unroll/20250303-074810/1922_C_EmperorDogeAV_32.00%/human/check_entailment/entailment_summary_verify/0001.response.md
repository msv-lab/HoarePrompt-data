### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of moving directly to another city is the absolute difference in their positions.
   - The key is to correctly identify the closest city for each city and then use this information to compute the minimum cost for each query.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases, processes each test case, and calculates the closest city for each city using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function aims to determine the closest city for each city. However, its logic is flawed because it incorrectly identifies the closest city. Specifically, it sets `back` to `-99999999` and `forward` to `99999999` at the start, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists are used to store prefix sums of the distances to the closest cities, but these are based on the incorrect closest city distances.
   - For each query, the code uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. It should find the city that minimizes the absolute distance, but the current logic is flawed.
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect closest city distances, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

However, upon closer inspection, the original assessment overlooks a critical aspect of the problem. The `func_1` function is indeed flawed, but the rest of the code logic, particularly the calculation of prefix sums and handling of queries, is correct given the flawed `func_1` function. The issue lies in the identification of the closest city, not in the overall structure of the solution.

To correctly identify the closest city, we need to iterate through the list and find the city that minimizes the absolute distance. The provided `func_1` function does not do this correctly, but the overall approach of using prefix sums and handling queries is sound.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is overly critical and overlooks the fact that the rest of the code logic, once the closest city is correctly identified, is correct. Therefore, the program can be fixed by correcting the `func_1` function to properly identify the closest city.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
