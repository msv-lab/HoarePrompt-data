Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities.
2. The key steps in solving this problem include:
   - Determining the closest city to each city.
   - Using prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cost of travel.
3. The provided code attempts to solve the problem by:
   - Reading the input and splitting the cities into two lists (`forward_cities` and `backward_cities`) using a custom function `func_1`.
   - Calculating prefix sums for these lists.
   - Processing queries to find the minimum cost of travel between two cities using the prefix sums.
4. However, there are issues with the logic in `func_1`:
   - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the closest city distances. It should compare the distances to the next and previous cities correctly.
   - The logic inside `func_1` does not properly determine the closest city. Specifically, it incorrectly sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city, which is not always correct.
   - The function should set `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the closest city, not just a fixed value of 1 or the absolute difference.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
