Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to n-2, if the difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate is less than the difference between the current city coordinate and the backward city coordinate (if available), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the forward and current city coordinates.
