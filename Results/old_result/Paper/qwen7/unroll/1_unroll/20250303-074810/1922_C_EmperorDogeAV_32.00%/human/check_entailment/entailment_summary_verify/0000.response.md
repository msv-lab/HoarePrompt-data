Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` aims to create a list `prog_cities` where each element represents the distance to the next city if it is closer than the previous city. However, the function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city based on the problem description. Specifically, it only checks the distance to the next and previous cities, which is insufficient to ensure that the closest city is unique for each city.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Closest City**: The function `func_1` does not ensure that for every city, the closest city is unique. It only compares the distances to the next and previous cities, which can fail in cases where the cities are densely packed or have specific spacing that violates the unique closest city condition.
2. **Example Provided**: The original assessment provides an example with cities `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. The closest city to city 1 is city 2, to city 2 is city 3, to city 3 is city 4, to city 4 is city 3, and to city 5 is city 4. The function `func_1` does not correctly identify these closest cities, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Analysis of the Main Program

The main program uses the results from `func_1` to compute prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) and then uses these sums to answer the queries. However, since `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest cities, the prefix sums will also be incorrect, leading to wrong answers for the queries.

### Correctness of the Program

Given the analysis above, the program is indeed incorrect because it relies on the results of `func_1`, which does not correctly identify the closest cities. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
