Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
2. The provided code correctly initializes the process for each test case by setting `current_year` to 0.
3. For each sign's periodicity \( a_i \), the code calculates the next year when the sign will occur. This is done by ensuring that the next year is the smallest multiple of \( a_i \) that is greater than or equal to the current year.
4. The logic in the loop ensures that the current year is updated only when a new sign occurs, and this process continues until all signs have occurred.
5. The function `func_1` processes each test case correctly and returns the expected results.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
