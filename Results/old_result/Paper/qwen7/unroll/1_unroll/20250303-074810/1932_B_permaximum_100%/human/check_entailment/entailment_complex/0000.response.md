Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it initializes the `current_year` to 0 and then iterates over the list of periodicities (`a`).
3. The logic inside the loop ensures that the `current_year` is adjusted to the next multiple of `ai` if the current year is not a multiple of `ai`. This ensures that the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one.
4. After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.
5. The provided examples match the expected behavior of the program. For instance, in the first example, the sequence of years calculated is correct: 3, 4, 8, 10, 18, 36.
6. The function `func_1` correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
