You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_i`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - It initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
     - If `current_year` is divisible by `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year` using `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

3. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic for finding the next year when the sign will occur seems correct.
   - The loop iterates through each periodicity, updating `current_year` accordingly.
   - This ensures that the program waits for the first sign to occur before moving to the next one.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the year when all signs will occur.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  3 2 4 5 9 18
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `3` (next year is `3`).
  - Second sign: `4` (next year is `4`).
  - Third sign: `4` (next year is `8`).
  - Fourth sign: `5` (next year is `10`).
  - Fifth sign: `9` (next year is `18`).
  - Sixth sign: `18` (next year is `36`).

- Output: `36`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 2 3 4 5
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `1` (next year is `1`).
  - Second sign: `2` (next year is `2`).
  - Third sign: `3` (next year is `3`).
  - Fourth sign: `4` (next year is `4`).
  - Fifth sign: `5` (next year is `5`).

- Output: `5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - Each sign occurs every year, so the next year for each sign is `1`.

- Output: `5` (since the last sign occurs in the 5th year)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  50 30 711 200 503 1006
  ```

- Calculation:
  - Start with `current_year = 0`.
  - First sign: `50` (next year is `50`).
  - Second sign: `50` (next year is `80`).
  - Third sign: `711` (next year is `1012`).
  - Fourth sign: `200` (next year is `1212`).
  - Fifth sign: `503` (next year is `1715`).
  - Sixth sign: `1006` (next year is `2012`).

- Output: `2012`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is correct.
