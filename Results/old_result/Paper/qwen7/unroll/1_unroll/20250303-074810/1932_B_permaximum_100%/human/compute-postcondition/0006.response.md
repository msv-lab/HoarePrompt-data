Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It returns a list `results` containing the final year `current_year` for each test case after executing a loop. For each test case `(n, a)`, `current_year` starts at 0 and iterates through each `ai` in `a`, updating `current_year` based on specific conditions. The final value of `current_year` for each test case is appended to `results`.**
