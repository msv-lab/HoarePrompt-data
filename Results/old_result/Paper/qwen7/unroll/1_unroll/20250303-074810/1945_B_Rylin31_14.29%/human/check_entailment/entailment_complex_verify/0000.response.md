### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time accurately. The issue lies in the calculation of `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is incorrect. The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then using that value in the calculation.

Let's break down the problem and the correct solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The key insight is that the fireworks from both installations will overlap at intervals that are multiples of the LCM of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` represents the smallest interval where both installations launch fireworks at the same time.
   - After this interval, the next overlapping point will be `LCM(a, b) + LCM(a, b)` and so on.

3. **Formula Derivation:**
   - Let `lcm_ab` be the LCM of `a` and `b`.
   - The number of fireworks from the first installation visible at any given time is `lcm_ab // a`.
   - The number of fireworks from the second installation visible at any given time is `lcm_ab // b`.
   - However, we must subtract 1 because the overlapping fireworks are counted twice.

Thus, the correct formula is:
\[ \text{max\_visible} = \left(\frac{\text{lcm\_ab}}{a} + \frac{\text{lcm\_ab}}{b} - 1\right) \]

4. **Corrected Code:**
   ```python
   from math import gcd

   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for i in range(t):
           (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
           lcm_ab = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
           mn = lcm_ab + m
           print(mn // a + mn // b - 1)
   ```

The original assessment provided a detailed explanation and a corrected version of the function. The corrected function uses the LCM of `a` and `b` and correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Given the analysis and the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
