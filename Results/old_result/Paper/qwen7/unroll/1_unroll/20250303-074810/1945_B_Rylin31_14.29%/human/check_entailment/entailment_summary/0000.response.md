Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function accurately solves the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
- Fireworks from the first installation are launched every \(a\) minutes.
- Fireworks from the second installation are launched every \(b\) minutes.
- Each firework is visible for \(m+1\) minutes after launch.
- The key observation is that if \(m\) is a multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\), then fireworks launched at \(m\) minutes from the start will overlap with the previous ones, allowing us to count them twice.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculation of \(mn\)**: The variable `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. This is a crucial part of the logic but needs further examination.
3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is used to check if \(m\) is a common multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\), excluding the trivial case where \(a\) or \(b\) is 1.
4. **Output Calculation**:
   - If the condition is true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

### Correctness Verification:
- The formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1` is derived from the fact that if \(m\) is a common multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\), then the number of fireworks visible at any given time is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation, plus one additional firework due to the overlap.
- The condition `m % a == 0 and m % b == 0` ensures that \(m\) is indeed a common multiple of both \(a\) and \(b\).
- The rest of the logic seems to handle the general case correctly.

Given the execution summary and the problem constraints, the provided solution appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
