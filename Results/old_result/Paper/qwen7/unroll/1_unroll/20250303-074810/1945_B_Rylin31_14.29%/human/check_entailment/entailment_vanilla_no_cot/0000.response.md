Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time is simply the sum of the divisions of `mn` by `a` and `b`. This approach does not account for the overlaps between the intervals when fireworks from both installations are visible at the same time.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`, which represents the interval at which both installations will launch fireworks simultaneously. The number of fireworks visible at any given time is then determined by how many intervals fit into the visibility period `m + 1`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of intervals of lcm within m+1
        intervals_a = (m + 1) // a
        intervals_b = (m + 1) // b
        intervals_lcm = (m + 1) // lcm
        # Maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time
        max_visible = intervals_a + intervals_b - intervals_lcm
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the least common multiple (LCM) to accurately determine the number of fireworks visible at the same time, accounting for overlaps.
