Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for all test cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
3
>><
```

Expected Output:
```
3 2 3 
```

However, the program outputs:
```
3 6 3 
```

This discrepancy occurs because the program incorrectly calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid when the pinball moves towards the center of the grid and then bounces back. The program's logic for calculating the time is flawed, leading to incorrect results for certain configurations of the grid.
