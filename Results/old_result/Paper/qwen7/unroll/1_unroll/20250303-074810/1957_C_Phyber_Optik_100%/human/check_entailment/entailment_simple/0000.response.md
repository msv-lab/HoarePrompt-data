Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of valid moves. The key points are:
   - You and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - No two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
   - The computer mirrors your moves unless \( r = c \).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations.
   - `dp` is initialized as a list of -1s, and `func_1` sets up the base cases and fills the DP table.
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it calculates the number of valid positions left after the initial moves and prints the corresponding value from the DP table.

3. **DP Table Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes the DP table such that `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), the recurrence relation used is:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This relation correctly models the number of ways to place rooks without attacking each other on an \( n \times n \) board.

4. **Main Loop Execution**:
   - The main loop reads the input for each test case.
   - It calculates the number of invalid positions (those already occupied by rooks) and uses this to index into the precomputed DP table.
   - The result is printed modulo \( 1000000007 \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where no more valid moves are possible by ensuring `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` returns 1 if no valid positions remain.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic and implementation appear to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
