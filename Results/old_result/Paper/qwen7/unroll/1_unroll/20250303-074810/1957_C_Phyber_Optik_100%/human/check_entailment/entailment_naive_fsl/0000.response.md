Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. Specifically, the program uses a precomputed dynamic programming array `dp` which does not account for the constraints and the mirroring behavior of the computer's moves.

To illustrate, let's consider the following test case:

- \( n = 4 \)
- \( k = 1 \)
- Moves: \( (1, 2) \)

After the initial moves, the board looks like this:
- White rook at (1, 2)
- Black rook at (2, 1)

The program calculates the number of configurations based on the size of the board minus the number of invalid positions (positions already occupied by rooks). However, this approach does not correctly account for the mirroring behavior and the fact that the computer cannot mirror certain moves.

The correct approach would involve calculating the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining valid positions, considering the constraints of no two rooks attacking each other and the mirroring behavior of the computer's moves. The current implementation does not handle this complexity correctly.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and hence the correctness is **False**.
