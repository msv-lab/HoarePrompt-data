You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:
import sys

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
dp = [-1 for _ in range(300007)]
func_1(300000)
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    invalid = set([])
    for _ in range(k):
        (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
        invalid.add(r)
        invalid.add(c)
    print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))

def func_1(n):
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. It computes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n contains the value `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for each respective `i`. After the function concludes, `dp` is returned, representing the computed values under the specified conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Import Statements and Recursion Limit Setting**:
   - The program starts by importing `sys` and setting the recursion limit to 400,000 using `sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)`. This is necessary because the problem involves potentially large values of `n`, and setting a high recursion limit ensures the program can handle deep recursive calls.
   - A list `dp` is initialized with -1 values up to 300,007, and a function `func_1` is called with 300,000 as an argument. This suggests that `dp` is intended to store results of some dynamic programming calculations.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.

3. **Tracking Invalid Positions**:
   - A set `invalid` is used to track positions that are already occupied by rooks. This is done by adding `r` and `c` for each of the `k` moves.
   - The size of this set gives the number of positions that are already invalid.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The program uses a precomputed DP array `dp` to calculate the number of valid configurations.
   - The value `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board without any two rooks attacking each other.
   - The formula used in the loop is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, which seems to be derived from combinatorial logic related to placing non-attacking rooks.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The number of valid configurations for an `n x n` board with `k` invalid positions is calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`. This accounts for the fact that even if all positions are invalid, there is still one valid configuration (no rooks placed).

### Verification:

- **Base Cases**:
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly defined.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` appears to be correct for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks.

- **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
  - The `dp` table is initialized to -1, and the function `func_1` populates it using the given recurrence relation. This ensures that the table is precomputed and ready for use.

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the input and tracks invalid positions.

- **Output Calculation**:
  - The calculation of the number of valid configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]` is correct.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and uses appropriate data structures and calculations, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
