Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Check for Impossibility**:
   - The logic to check if it's impossible to make all squares the same color is flawed. Specifically, the current implementation only checks the corners and edges but doesn't fully cover all necessary conditions.
   
2. **Insufficient Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The code does not handle cases where the grid size is small enough to make the task trivially impossible, such as a 1x1 grid or a 2x2 grid with mixed colors.

3. **Incomplete Logic**:
   - The solution does not account for all possible configurations of the grid. It only checks specific patterns and does not cover all scenarios where making all squares the same color is possible.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should consider the following steps:

1. **Check Initial Colors**:
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color because no operation can change the color of the entire subrectangle without affecting other parts of the grid.

2. **Check Rows and Columns**:
   - Ensure that all rows and columns have the same color. If any row or column has mixed colors, it indicates that it's impossible to make all squares the same color.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        # Check if top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n-1][m-1]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if all rows have the same color
        row_colors = set(gr[i][0] for i in range(n))
        if len(row_colors) > 1:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if all columns have the same color
        col_colors = set(gr[0][i] for i in range(m))
        if len(col_colors) > 1:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        print("YES")

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the solution handles all necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.
