### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation involves selecting any two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if the top-left corner (0,0) and the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) have the same color.
     - If they do not, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If they do, it further checks if the entire first row and the entire first column are uniform in color.
       - If the first row or the first column is not uniform, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If all checks pass, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Initial Check:**
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the corners independently.
   - **Row and Column Checks:**
     - If the first row and the first column are uniform, it implies that the entire grid can be made uniform by performing operations along these rows and columns.
     - However, there are several issues with this logic:
       - The solution assumes that if the first row and first column are uniform, then the entire grid must be uniform. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider a grid where the first row and first column are 'W', but the rest of the grid is a mix of 'W' and 'B'. The solution would incorrectly mark this as 'YES' because the first row and column are uniform, even though the entire grid cannot be uniformized.
       - The solution does not account for other configurations where the grid can still be uniformized even if the first row and column are not uniform. For instance, a grid where the first row and column are 'W', but the rest of the grid is uniform 'B' can still be made uniform 'W' by performing operations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where the grid might already be uniform (as seen in some test cases).
   - However, it fails to handle cases where the grid can be uniformized without the first row and column being uniform. For example, a grid where the first row and column are 'W', but the rest of the grid is 'B' cannot be uniformized, but the solution would incorrectly mark it as 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is not correct because it incorrectly marks some grids as 'YES' when they should be marked as 'NO'. Specifically, it fails to account for scenarios where the grid can be uniformized without the first row and column being uniform.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
