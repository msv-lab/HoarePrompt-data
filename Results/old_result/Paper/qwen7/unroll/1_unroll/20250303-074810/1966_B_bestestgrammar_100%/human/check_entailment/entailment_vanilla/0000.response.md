### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation involves selecting any two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if the top-left corner (0,0) and the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) have the same color.
     - If they do not, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If they do, it further checks if the entire first row and the entire first column are uniform in color.
       - If the first row or the first column is not uniform, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If all checks pass, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Initial Check:** 
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the corners independently.
   - **Row and Column Checks:**
     - If the first row and the first column are uniform, it implies that the entire grid can be made uniform by performing operations along these rows and columns.
     - This logic is sound because:
       - If the first row is uniform, any operation involving this row will maintain its uniformity.
       - Similarly, if the first column is uniform, any operation involving this column will maintain its uniformity.
       - By extending these uniform rows and columns, the entire grid can be made uniform.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where the grid might already be uniform (as seen in some test cases).
   - It correctly identifies grids that cannot be uniformized (as seen in the first test case).

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
