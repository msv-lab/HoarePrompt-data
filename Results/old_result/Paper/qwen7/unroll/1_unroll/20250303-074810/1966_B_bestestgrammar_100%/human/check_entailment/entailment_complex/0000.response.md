Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and the grid itself.

2. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the top-left cell (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right cell (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are different, it immediately sets `ans` to 'NO' because it's impossible to make all cells the same color if the corners are of different colors.

3. **Row and Column Checks**: 
   - It then checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same. This is done by iterating through the first row and first column and checking if any cell differs from the first cell in its respective row or column.
   - Similarly, it checks if all cells in the last row and last column are the same.

4. **Final Decision**: If the top-left and bottom-right cells are the same, and all cells in the first row and first column, as well as the last row and last column, are the same, the program sets `ans` to 'YES'. Otherwise, it remains 'NO'.

5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

Given the logic and the checks performed, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
