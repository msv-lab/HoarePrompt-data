### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation involves selecting any two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if the top-left corner (0,0) and the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) have the same color.
     - If they do not, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If they do, it further checks if the entire first row and the entire first column are uniform in color.
       - If the first row or the first column is not uniform, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If all checks pass, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Initial Check:**
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the corners independently.
   - **Row and Column Checks:**
     - If the first row and the first column are uniform, it implies that the entire grid can be made uniform by performing operations along these rows and columns.
     - However, the current implementation only checks the uniformity of the first row and the first column, but it does not ensure that the entire grid can be uniformized.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where the grid might already be uniform (as seen in some test cases).
   - It correctly identifies grids that cannot be uniformized (as seen in the first test case).
   - However, there are scenarios where the grid can be uniformized even if the first row and first column are not uniform. For example, consider a grid where the first row and first column are mixed but the rest of the grid is uniform. The solution would incorrectly mark such a grid as 'NO'.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios where the grid can be uniformized. The checks for the first row and first column are insufficient to guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the grid can be uniformized even if the first row and first column are not uniform.
