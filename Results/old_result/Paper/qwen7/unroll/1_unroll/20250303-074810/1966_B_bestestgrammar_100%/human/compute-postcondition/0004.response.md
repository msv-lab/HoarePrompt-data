Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they are different, it checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same, and if all cells in the last row and last column are the same. Based on these checks, the function sets the variable `ans` to either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions are met. Finally, the function prints `ans` for each test case.**
