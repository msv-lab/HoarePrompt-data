You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        ans = 'YES'
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they are different, it checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same, and if all cells in the last row and last column are the same. Based on these checks, the function sets the variable `ans` to either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions are met. Finally, the function prints `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are different, it assumes it's impossible to make all squares the same color. However, this assumption is incorrect because the program does not consider other possible configurations that could lead to all squares being the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```

In this case, the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors ('B' and 'W'), so the program incorrectly outputs 'NO'. However, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:

1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 3) to color all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) to the same color.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2) to color all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 2) to (3, 2) to the same color.

After these operations, all squares in the grid will be the same color. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for this case.
