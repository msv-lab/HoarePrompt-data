Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and now `t` is the integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific integer value input by the user.
