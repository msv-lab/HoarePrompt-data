Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string and prints their sum. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters when we encounter the substrings "map" or "pie". Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        i = 0
        deletions = 0
        
        while i < len(s):
            if 'map' in s[i:i+3]:
                deletions += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            elif 'pie' in s[i:i+3]:
                deletions += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This corrected program iterates through the string and checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in each possible 3-character window. When found, it increments the deletion count and skips the next 3 characters to avoid double-counting overlaps.
