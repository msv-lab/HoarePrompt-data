Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the maximum final score by always choosing the minimum of the current pair of integers from the sorted list. This approach ensures that the score is maximized because it always adds the smaller number of each pair, which is optimal for maximizing the sum.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. The program reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and the list of \( 2n \) integers.
3. It sorts the list of integers.
4. It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair to the score.
5. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

This approach works correctly because:
- Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are paired together first.
- Adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller of the two) ensures that we are always maximizing the score at each step.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program logic aligns with the requirement to maximize the score by always selecting the minimum of the current pair.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
