You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        score = 0
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        print(score)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \). For each test case, it sorts the \( 2n \) integers and calculates the score as the sum of the first element of each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list. The function prints the score for each test case and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is crucial because the optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available numbers to maximize the score.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`).
   - It adds the elements at even indices to the score. Since the list is sorted, these elements are the smallest available numbers.

4. **Output**:
   - The score is printed for each test case.

### Reasoning

- **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to pair the smallest numbers together to maximize the score. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired first.
- **Correctness of Iteration**: By iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, the program pairs the smallest numbers together, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always picking the smallest available numbers.
