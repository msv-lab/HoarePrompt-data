Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is crucial because the optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available numbers to maximize the score.

3. **Scoring**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2 (i.e., `range(0, 2 * n, 2)`).
   - It adds the elements at even indices to the score. Since the list is sorted, these elements are the smallest available numbers.

4. **Output**:
   - The score is printed for each test case.

### Reasoning

- **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to pair the smallest numbers together to maximize the score. Sorting ensures that the smallest numbers are paired first.
- **Correctness of Iteration**: By iterating over the sorted list in steps of 2, the program pairs the smallest numbers together, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always picking the smallest available numbers.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
