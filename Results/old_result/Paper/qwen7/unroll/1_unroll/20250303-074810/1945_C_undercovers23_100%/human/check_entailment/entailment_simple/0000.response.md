### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The program initializes necessary variables (`n`, `s`, `sl`, `o`, `z`, `zero`, `one`, `lst`, `mini`) appropriately. This is correct.

3. **Calculation of Zero and One Percentages**: The program calculates the percentage of zeros and ones correctly. However, the calculation of percentages using `* 100 //` might lead to incorrect results due to integer division. It should use floating-point division for more accurate results.

4. **Condition Checking**: The program checks if the percentage of zeros and ones in the respective halves is at least 50%. This logic is correct but could be optimized.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position**: The program iterates through the string to find the optimal position `i` where the conditions are met. This is correct.

6. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where no suitable position is found by checking the overall percentage of '1's. This is correct.

7. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position `i` correctly. This is correct.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Line 13**: `pk = n / 2` is redundant since the value of `pk` is used only once and can be directly calculated inside the loop.
- **Line 15**: `sl = list(s)` converts the string `s` to a list, which is unnecessary since `s` is already a string and can be iterated directly.
- **Line 16**: `o = sl.count('1')` and `z = sl.count('0')` count the number of '1's and '0's, which is correct.
- **Line 18**: `zero, one = 0, 0` initializes counters for zeros and ones.
- **Line 20**: `lst = []` initializes an empty list to store valid positions.
- **Line 22**: `mini = pow(10, 8)` sets an initial large value for `mini`.
- **Loop from Line 24 to 32**: This loop iterates through the string to check if the conditions are met. The logic is correct but can be simplified.
- **Line 34**: `for ele in lst`: This loop finds the minimum distance from `pk` and appends the corresponding position to `final`.
- **Line 36**: `final.sort()` sorts the list, which is unnecessary if the list is already sorted.
- **Line 38**: The edge case handling is correct.
- **Line 40**: The final position is printed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program logic is correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The minor issues mentioned do not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
**True**
