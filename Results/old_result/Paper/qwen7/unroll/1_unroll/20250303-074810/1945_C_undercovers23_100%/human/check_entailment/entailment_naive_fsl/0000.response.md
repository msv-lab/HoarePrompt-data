Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program calculates percentages instead of using the ceiling function to determine the required number of zeros and ones on each side of the road. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
011001
```

According to the problem description, the program should:
- Calculate the required number of zeros on the left side: \(\lceil \frac{2}{2} \rceil = 1\)
- Calculate the required number of ones on the right side: \(\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\)

However, the program calculates percentages and checks if these percentages are greater than or equal to 50%. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that the number of zeros and ones meet the required threshold.

In the given input, the program will incorrectly determine that the road can be placed after the second house, but this does not satisfy the condition since there are only 1 zero on the left side and 2 ones on the right side, which is correct but the logic used is flawed.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
