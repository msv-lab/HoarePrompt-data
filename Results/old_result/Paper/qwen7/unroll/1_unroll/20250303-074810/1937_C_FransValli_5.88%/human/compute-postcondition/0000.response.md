Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, often to iterate over a specified number of times without using the value in the loop body.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the condition provided in the `range()` function, which in this case is `int(input())`.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will execute based on user input, we need to ensure that the input provided will allow the loop to run at least once. 

Given that `int(input())` is used to determine the number of iterations, the user must provide an integer input that is at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Formulate the State**: Based on the above analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input provided to `int(input())`, ensuring it is a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **The input provided to `int(input())` must be a positive integer**.
