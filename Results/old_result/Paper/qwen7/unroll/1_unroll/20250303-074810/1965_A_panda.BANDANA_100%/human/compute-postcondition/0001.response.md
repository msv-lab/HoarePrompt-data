Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and `t`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Therefore, the loop will start executing when `i` is 0 and continue until `i` is less than `t`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `i` must start at 0 and `t` must be a positive integer such that the loop can run for at least one iteration (i.e., `t > 0`).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` and `i`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 0 and `t` should be a positive integer.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
