Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list a contains n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each a_i, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid, but now `t` is specifically assigned the value of the input integer. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
