Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \) such that \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided code does not actually construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it computes a list `mex` which is supposed to represent the MEX values for the permutation, but it does not use these values to construct the permutation itself.
3. The function `func_1()` simply prints the `mex` list without using it to generate the permutation \( p \).

Given the requirements of the problem, the function should generate the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX values, but the current implementation does not do this. Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
