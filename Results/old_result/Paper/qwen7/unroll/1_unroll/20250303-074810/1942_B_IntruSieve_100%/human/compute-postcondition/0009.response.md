Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`.
- `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- `mex` is iterated over and printed.
- `used` remains unchanged.

The `print()` statement without any arguments will simply print an empty line. Since no variables or objects are explicitly mentioned to be printed within the `print()` function, the output will be an empty line.

Output: **an empty line**
