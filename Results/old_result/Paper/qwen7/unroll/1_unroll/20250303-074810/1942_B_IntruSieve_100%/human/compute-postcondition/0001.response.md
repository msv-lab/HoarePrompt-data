Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from the standard input, converts each integer to a string, and then splits the string into individual elements. These elements are then mapped to integers and collected into a list named `arr`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
