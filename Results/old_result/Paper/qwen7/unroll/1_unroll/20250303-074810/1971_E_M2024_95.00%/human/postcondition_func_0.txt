The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, k, q, and lists a and b. For each test case, it handles q queries, where each query provides an integer d. The function calculates and prints the interpolated value between two points in the lists a and b based on the position d for each query. The interpolated value is determined using the differences in elements of lists a and b, and the results are printed as integers. This process is repeated for all test cases.
