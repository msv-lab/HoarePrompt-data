You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Timur is in a car traveling on the number line from point 0 to point n . The
car starts moving from point 0 at minute 0 .

There are k+1 signs on the line at points 0, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k , and Timur
knows that the car will arrive there at minutes 0, b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k ,
respectively. The sequences a and b are strictly increasing with a_k = n .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/eaf3bfb8e7a8fa4f5e8673f9a02116761cb86c93.png)

Between any two adjacent signs, the car travels with a constant speed. Timur
has q queries: each query will be an integer d , and Timur wants you to output
how many minutes it takes the car to reach point d , rounded down to the
nearest integer.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and q , (k
\leq n \leq 10^9 ; 1 \leq k, q \leq 10^5 ) — the final destination, the number
of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

The second line of each test case contains k integers a_i (1 \leq a_i \leq n ;
a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ; a_k = n ).

The third line of each test case contains k integers b_i (1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9
; b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 \leq i \leq k-1 ).

Each of the following q lines contains a single integer d (0 \leq d \leq n ) —
the distance that Timur asks the minutes passed for.

The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 , and the sum of q over
all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output a single integer — the number of minutes passed until
the car reaches the point d , rounded down.

Note

For the first test case, the car goes from point 0 to point 10 in 10 minutes,
so the speed is 1 unit per minute and:

  * At point 0 , the time will be 0 minutes. 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 6 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 7 minutes. 

For the second test case, between points 0 and 4 , the car travels at a speed
of 1 unit per minute and between 4 and 10 with a speed of 2 units per minute
and:

  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 4 , the time will be 4 minutes. 
  * At point 2 , the time will be 2 minutes. 
  * At point 7 , the time will be 5.5 minutes, so the answer is 5 . 

For the fourth test case, the car travels with 1.2 units per minute, so the
answers to the queries are:

  * At point 2 , the time will be 1.66\dots minutes, so the answer is 1 . 
  * At point 6 , the time will be 5 minutes. 
  * At point 5 , the time will be 4.16\dots minutes, so the answer is 4 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each query within each test case. For each test case, there will be `q` lines of output, where each line contains the result of a query. Each query involves finding the interpolated value between two points defined by arrays `a` and `b`, based on the position `ql` provided in the query. The interpolated value is calculated using the differences in `a` and `b` arrays and printed as an integer. This process is repeated for `t` test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and stores them in `ad`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the time differences between consecutive points in `b` and stores them in `bd`.

3. **Speed Calculation:**
   - It computes the speed between each pair of consecutive points using the formula \( v = \frac{ad[i]}{bd[i]} \) and stores these speeds in the list `v`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the queried point `ql` lies.
   - If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance within the current segment and adds the time taken to travel this distance at the current speed.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Binary Search Usage:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` is correct for finding the segment where the queried point lies.

2. **Time Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the time to reach the queried point is sound. It correctly handles the case where the point lies exactly on a known point and calculates the time for the remaining distance in the current segment.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as the first point (0) and the last point (`n`) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the queried point is exactly one of the known points.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program is consistent with the problem statement and correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and handles all the specified requirements and edge cases appropriately.
