Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
2. It computes the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b` to derive the distances traveled and the corresponding times.
3. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in `a` where the queried distance `d` lies.
4. If the queried distance exactly matches a known point in `a`, it directly outputs the corresponding time from `b`.
5. Otherwise, it interpolates the time based on the known segments in `a` and `b`.
6. The interpolation logic seems correct, as it calculates the time taken to travel the remaining distance within the current segment using the speed derived from the previous segment.

Given the provided execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to handle the problem correctly according to the specified requirements.

Correctness: **True**
