Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the function accurately calculates the time taken for the car to reach a given point \(d\) based on the known points and times.

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`. It also correctly initializes the lists `a` and `b` with the given points and times, respectively.

2. **Speed Calculation**: The function correctly computes the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and then calculates the speed between these points. This part of the code is correct.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, the function uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of the journey that includes the queried point `ql`. It then interpolates the time taken to reach `ql` within that segment. The interpolation formula used is correct:
   \[
   m += b[s - 1] + bd[s] \times \frac{ql - a[s - 1]}{ad[s]}
   \]
   This formula correctly calculates the time taken to travel from the previous known point to the queried point.

4. **Output**: The function prints the calculated time for each query, which is correct.

Given that the logic for handling the test cases, parsing the input, calculating speeds, and interpolating the time for each query is correct, the program should produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
