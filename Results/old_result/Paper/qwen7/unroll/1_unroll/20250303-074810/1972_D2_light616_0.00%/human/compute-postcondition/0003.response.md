Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `x * x <= n`.
2. **Identify the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `x` and `n`.
3. **Determine the current state of these variables**:
   - `x` is currently 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `x * x <= n` must be true.
   - Substituting the current value of `x` (which is 1), the condition becomes `1 * 1 <= n` or `1 <= n`.

Since `n` is an input integer, we cannot directly change its value. However, we need to ensure that the condition `1 <= n` holds true for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is 1, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0**
