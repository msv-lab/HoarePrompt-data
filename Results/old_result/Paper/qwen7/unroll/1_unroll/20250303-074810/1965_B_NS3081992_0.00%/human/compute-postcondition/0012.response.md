Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `l` is the length of `b`.**

Explanation: The code `bk = bin(k)[2:]` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation using `bin(k)`, which includes the '0b' prefix. By slicing `[2:]`, it removes the '0b' prefix and assigns the result to `bk`. The values of `b`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
