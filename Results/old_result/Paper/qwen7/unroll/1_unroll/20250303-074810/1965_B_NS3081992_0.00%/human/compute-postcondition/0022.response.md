Postcondition: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` contains the initial values `[2, 3]` plus additional powers of 2 starting from `2^2` up to `2^(l-2)`, and `n` is not equal to 2. If `k` is not 1, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2`**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the variables after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
