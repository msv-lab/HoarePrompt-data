Output State: **`ans` is [1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1]**.

The list `ans` originally contains the values [1, 2, 4, 8, 13]. After executing the line `ans.append(k + 1)`, the value `k + 1` is appended to the list `ans`. Since the value of `k` is not specified, the updated list includes the new element `k + 1`.
