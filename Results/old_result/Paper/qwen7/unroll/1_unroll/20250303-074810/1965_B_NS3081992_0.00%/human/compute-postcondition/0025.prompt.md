You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`. `n` is not equal to 2
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (up to 2^(l-2))], `n` is not equal to 2.
        #
        #In this output state, after the loop has executed all its iterations, `ans` will contain the initial values `[2, 3]` plus additional powers of 2 starting from `2^2` up to `2^(l-2)`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `l-1`, appending `2 ** i` to `ans` for each iteration, where `i` starts at 2 and goes up to `l-1`.
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):

        #State: ans is [1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
    #State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` contains the initial values `[2, 3]` plus additional powers of 2 starting from `2^2` up to `2^(l-2)`, and `n` is not equal to 2. If `k` is not 1, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2`
    return ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a space-separated string of numbers starting from 2, 3, followed by powers of 2 from 2^2 to 2^(length of b - 2), and ends with k + 1 and 2 * k + 1 if k is 1, otherwise it includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either '1\n2' or a space-separated string of numbers starting from 2, 3, followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{(length \, of \, b - 2)}\), and ends with \(k + 1\) and \(2 * k + 1\) if \(k\) is 1, otherwise it includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, \(k + 1\), \(2 * k + 1\), 2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a space-separated string of numbers starting from 2, 3, followed by powers of 2 from 2^2 to 2^(length of b - 2), and ends with k + 1 and 2 * k + 1 if k is 1, otherwise it includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
