### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_14()` in detail to determine if it correctly generates a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions.

1. **Function `func_14()` Analysis:**
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation and calculates the length `l` of this binary string.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n` is either `2` or greater than `2`.
     - For `n == 2`, it returns `1` and `2`.
     - For `n > 2`, it initializes the answer list `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of `2` starting from `2^2` up to `2^l`.
   - For other values of `k`, it constructs the sequence by:
     - Initializing an empty list `ans`.
     - Appending powers of `2` up to `2^(lk-1)` where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - Appending `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum `k` is not possible.
     - Appending `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure certain sums are possible.
     - Appending powers of `2` starting from `2^lk` up to `2^l`.

2. **Validation Against Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1:** No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`.
     - The function ensures that `k` is not a subsequence sum by explicitly avoiding it.
   - **Condition 2:** For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.
     - The function includes all necessary powers of `2` to cover all sums from `1` to `n` except `k`.

3. **Examples:**
   - **Test Case: `n = 9`, `k = 3`**
     - Binary representation of `9` is `1001`.
     - Binary representation of `3` is `11`.
     - The sequence generated is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
     - Checking subsequences:
       - Subsequences that sum to `3`: `[3]`, `[1, 2]` (not included).
       - All other sums from `1` to `9` are covered except `3`.

   - **Test Case: `n = 6`, `k = 1`**
     - Binary representation of `6` is `110`.
     - The sequence generated is `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
     - Checking subsequences:
       - Subsequences that sum to `1`: None (correctly handled).
       - All other sums from `2` to `6` are covered.

4. **Function `func_15()` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14()` for each test case.
   - It prints the sequence size for each test case.

Given the analysis, the function `func_14()` correctly generates sequences that meet the required conditions for all test cases. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues that do not exist in the provided implementation.
