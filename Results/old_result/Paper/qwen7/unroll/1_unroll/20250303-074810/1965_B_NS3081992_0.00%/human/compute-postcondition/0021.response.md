Output State: **ans is [1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)].**

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = lk` and continues until `i < l`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, the elements added to `ans` will be `2 ** lk`, `2 ** (lk + 1)`, ..., `2 ** (l - 1)`. The initial elements `[1, 2, 4, 8, 13, k + 1, 2 * k + 1]` remain unchanged.
