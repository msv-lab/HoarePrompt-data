Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the number of test cases as an integer, which is obtained from the function func_10. It then returns the size of the sequence for each test case as an integer, which is obtained from the function func_14.**

This means the function `func_15` does not take any input parameters. Instead, it relies on two other functions, `func_10` and `func_14`, to provide the necessary data. Specifically, it first retrieves the number of test cases using `func_10` and then, for each test case, gets the size of the sequence using `func_14`.
