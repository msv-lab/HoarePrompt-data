### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function processes the input values `n` and `k` and ensures that `k` is even if `n` is odd. It also checks if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`), which is calculated based on whether `n` is odd or even.
   - If `k` is odd or exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no solution exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to construct a permutation with the given `n` and `k` such that the Manhattan value matches `k`.
   - It iteratively modifies the list `l` by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The function ensures that after processing, the list `l` has a Manhattan value of `k`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function swaps elements at specific indices in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It helps in achieving the required Manhattan value by swapping elements strategically.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function swaps elements at symmetric positions in the list `l` to further adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It helps in fine-tuning the list to match the required Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function prints the result if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` and a newline, indicating a valid permutation was found.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to validate the input and then `func_1` to generate the permutation.
   - It then uses `func_5` to print the result if a valid permutation is found.

### Analysis:
- The overall logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the steps to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value.
- Each function is designed to handle specific parts of the problem:
  - `func_4` validates the input.
  - `func_1` constructs the permutation.
  - `func_2` and `func_3` help in adjusting the permutation to meet the required Manhattan value.
  - `func_5` handles the output.

### Conclusion:
Given the logical flow and the correctness of each function, the program should work as intended for the given problem constraints.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
