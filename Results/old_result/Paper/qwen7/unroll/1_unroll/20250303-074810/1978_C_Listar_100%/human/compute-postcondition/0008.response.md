Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns 0. Alternatively, it returns the value of `l`, which is the return value of `func_1(n, k)` and is also passed as an argument to `func_5(l)`**.

This means the function does not take any input parameters but instead relies on the values of `n` and `k` from elsewhere (possibly from previous function calls). It then either returns 0 or the result of `func_5(l)`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`.
