Output State: **`l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `l = func_1(n, k)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `k`. The function `func_1` returns a value which is assigned to `l`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The precondition that `n` is a positive integer within the specified range and `k` is an integer within the specified range, and `n` is not equal to 0, still holds true.
