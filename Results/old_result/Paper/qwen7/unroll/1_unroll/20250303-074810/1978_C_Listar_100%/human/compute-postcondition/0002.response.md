Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), but its specific value is not provided.
- Both `n` and `k` are the results of a call to `func_4()`, but the exact function is not specified, so we do not need to determine the value of `k` to answer the question.

The print statement simply outputs the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
