### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) when the permutation is reversed.
   - If \( k \) is odd, no permutation can achieve this because the Manhattan value is always even (sum of absolute differences).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_4` checks if \( k \) is even and within the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given \( n \).
   - `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` handle specific swaps to adjust the permutation.

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - `func_4` correctly identifies if \( k \) is even and within bounds.
   - `func_1` tries to build the permutation but has issues with logic and edge cases.
   - The swap functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are intended to adjust the permutation but are not fully implemented to handle all cases.

5. **Issues Identified**:
   - `func_1` does not handle all edge cases and may return incorrect permutations.
   - The logic in `func_1` is incomplete and relies on recursive calls without proper base cases.
   - The swap functions do not cover all necessary adjustments to achieve the exact Manhattan value.

6. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to reduce the problem size by decrementing `k` and recursively calling itself. However, it does not ensure that the permutation is constructed correctly.
   - The function `func_1` uses a loop that decrements `k` by `i - 1` and calls `func_3` and `func_2` to swap elements. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the Manhattan value will be exactly `k`.

7. **Correctness of Swap Functions**:
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are intended to swap elements to adjust the permutation. However, these functions are not implemented to handle all necessary adjustments and may lead to incorrect permutations.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases where `k` is very small or very large relative to `n`.
   - The function does not ensure that the permutation is valid (i.e., contains all numbers from 1 to `n` exactly once).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for finding a permutation with the specified Manhattan value. There are logical errors and missing parts in the implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the detailed steps and the lack of proper handling of edge cases and the construction of the permutation.
