Output State: **The program returns the values of `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. The value of `max_k` is the maximum value between `n` (if `n` is odd) and `k` (if `n` is even), and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
