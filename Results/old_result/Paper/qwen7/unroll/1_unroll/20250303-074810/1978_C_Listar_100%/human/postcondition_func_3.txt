The function processes two integers `n` and `k` provided as space-separated values on a single line. It first checks if `k` is odd and returns (0, 0) if true. Then, it calculates the maximum possible value `max_k` based on whether `n` is odd or even. If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.
