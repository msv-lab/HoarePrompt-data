Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, n and q are integers derived from the input, a is a list of n integers, and each query consists of two integers l and r where 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n.**

The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
