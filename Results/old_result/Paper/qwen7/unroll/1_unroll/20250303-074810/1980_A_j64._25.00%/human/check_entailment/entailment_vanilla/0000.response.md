Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input.
2. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq`.
3. It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
4. The sum of these missing problems is appended to the `results` list.
5. Finally, the function returns the list of results.
6. The main part of the program iterates over the predefined `test_cases` and prints the results returned by `func_1`.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the logic in the `func_1` function matches the requirements accurately. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
