Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input.
2. For each test case, it calculates the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using a list `freq`. This part is correct and matches the problem description.
3. It then determines how many problems are missing for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds. This is also correct.
4. The sum of these missing problems is appended to the `results` list. This step is accurate and aligns with the problem requirements.
5. Finally, the function returns the list of results. This is correct and matches the expected output format.
6. The main part of the program iterates over the predefined `test_cases` and prints the results returned by `func_1`. However, there is a discrepancy here. The original assessment mentions that the program reads input from standard input, but the provided code does not read any input; instead, it uses predefined `test_cases`.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the logic in the `func_1` function matches the requirements accurately. However, the main part of the program does not match the problem description because it does not read input from the user but instead uses predefined test cases.

Since the main part of the program does not follow the problem description, the original assessment is partially correct regarding the function `func_1` but incorrect regarding the main part of the program.

Final: **False**
