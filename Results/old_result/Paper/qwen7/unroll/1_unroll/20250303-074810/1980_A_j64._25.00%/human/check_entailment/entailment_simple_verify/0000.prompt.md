You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure he has at least one problem of each difficulty level for the specified number of rounds. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (10, 1, 'BGECDCBDED'):
     - The bank has 10 problems with difficulties 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'E'.
     - Since only one round is needed, we need at least one problem of each difficulty level.
     - The program correctly identifies that two additional problems ('A' and 'F') are needed, resulting in a total of 2.
   - For the second test case (10, 2, 'BGECDCBDED'):
     - The bank has 10 problems with difficulties 'B', 'G', 'E', 'C', 'D', 'B', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'E'.
     - Two rounds are needed, so we need at least two problems of each difficulty level.
     - The program correctly identifies that five additional problems ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E') are needed, resulting in a total of 5.
   - For the third test case (9, 1, 'BBCDEFFGG'):
     - The bank has 9 problems with difficulties 'B', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'F', 'F', 'G'.
     - Only one round is needed, so we need at least one problem of each difficulty level.
     - The program correctly identifies that one additional problem ('A') is needed, resulting in a total of 1.

2. **General Case Analysis**:
   - The program uses a frequency array to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
   - It then calculates the number of missing problems required for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
   - The logic ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases like having fewer than `m` problems of a certain difficulty level.

Since the program works correctly for all provided test cases and generalizes well to handle the described problem, the correctness is **True**.
