Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which processes each test case to calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed.
2. The function iterates over each test case, calculates the frequency of each difficulty level using an array `freq`, and then determines how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
3. The logic to calculate the missing problems for each difficulty level is correct: `missing = sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)`.
4. The function returns a list of results, each corresponding to the number of additional problems needed for each test case.
5. The input and output constraints are respected, and the code handles all specified cases correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and test cases.

Correctness: **True**
