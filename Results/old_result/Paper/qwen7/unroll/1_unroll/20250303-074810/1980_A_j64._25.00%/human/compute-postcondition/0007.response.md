Functionality: **The function calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case to ensure that the frequency of each character in the string 'a' is at least 'm'. It accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer indicating the number of test cases (with 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the number of problems `n`, the number of upcoming rounds `m`, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of missing elements required for the corresponding test case.**
