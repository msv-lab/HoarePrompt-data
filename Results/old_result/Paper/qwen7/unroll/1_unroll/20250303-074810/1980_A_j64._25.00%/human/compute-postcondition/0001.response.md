Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases` is still a list of tuples containing the specified elements.
