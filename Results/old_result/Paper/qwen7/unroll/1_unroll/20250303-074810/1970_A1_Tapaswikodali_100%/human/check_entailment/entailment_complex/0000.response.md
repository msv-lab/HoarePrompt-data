Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The operation involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting based on balance and position, and then constructing the resulting sequence.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position. It correctly handles the sorting logic by returning the difference in balance or position depending on the conditions.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function processes the input string `s` to create a list of `BalanceInfo` objects. It then sorts this list based on the specified criteria and constructs the result string. The overall logic aligns with the problem statement.

Given the provided annotations and the logic implemented in both functions, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
