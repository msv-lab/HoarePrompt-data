Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character from `s` at that index, sorted by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order within groups of same balance.**

Explanation: The code sorts the `balance_info` list based on two criteria: first by the `balance` attribute in ascending order, and second by the `position` (index) in descending order for those elements that have the same balance. The other variables (`s`, `n`, and `balance`) remain unchanged.
