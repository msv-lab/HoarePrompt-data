Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to implement a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence.
2. The `func_2` function is responsible for performing the entire process as described in the problem statement.
3. Let's break down the steps in `func_2`:
   - It initializes an empty list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string `s`, calculating the balance at each position and storing the `BalanceInfo` object in the list.
   - After collecting all `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them based on their balance (ascending) and position (descending).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.
4. The `func_1` function is used as a key function in the sorting process to ensure that the `BalanceInfo` objects are sorted correctly.
5. Given the problem description and the execution summary of `func_2`, the implementation appears to follow the steps required to perform the balanced shuffle operation accurately.

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
