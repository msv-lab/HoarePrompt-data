### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires implementing a balanced shuffle operation on a balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves sorting the characters based on their prefix balance and position.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Class Definition**: A class `BalanceInfo` is defined to store the balance, position, and character information for each position in the input string.
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic but is part of the provided code. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function implements the balanced shuffle operation.
     - **Initialization**: It initializes variables and creates a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - **Balance Calculation**: It calculates the balance for each character in the string.
     - **Sorting**: It sorts the `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
     - **Result Construction**: It constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.
     - **Output**: It prints the result string.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the balance and constructing the result string appears correct.
   - The sorting key `(x.balance, -x.position)` ensures that characters are sorted by their prefix balance in ascending order and by their position in descending order when balances are equal.
   - The final result is constructed correctly by joining the characters from the sorted list of `BalanceInfo` objects.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
