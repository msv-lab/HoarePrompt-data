You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        ans.append(p)
    return reversed(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end of `a` based on the characters in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, taking the result modulo `m` at each step, and stores these intermediate results in a list `ans`. Finally, it returns the reversed list of these intermediate results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The given program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the value `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
3. The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
4. In `func_1`, the logic to handle the commands 'L' and 'R' is incorrect. It appends the elements from the array `a` to the list `b` based on the command, but this does not align with the problem statement. According to the problem, the product of the array elements should be computed before each command is processed, and the element should be removed after computing the product.
5. The variable `p` in `func_1` is used to store the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command is processed. This is correct.
6. However, the loop in `func_1` iterates over the list `b` in reverse, which is unnecessary and incorrect because `b` is built by appending elements from `a` based on the commands, not by the remaining elements after each command.
7. The final result should be returned in the correct order, but the current implementation returns the results in reverse order.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement.
