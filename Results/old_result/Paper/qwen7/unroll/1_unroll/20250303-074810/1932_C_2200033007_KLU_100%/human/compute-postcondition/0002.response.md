Output State: **`b` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R', `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The code simply assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `r`. The other variables remain unchanged.
