### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the given function summary.

1. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters, which is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by iterating through `a` and appending elements from the start or end of `a` based on the commands in `s`. This part is incorrect according to the problem statement.
   - The problem requires computing the product of the array elements before each command is processed and then removing the corresponding element.
   - Instead, the function builds `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands, which does not reflect the intended logic.

3. **Product Calculation:**
   - The variable `p` is used to store the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command is processed. This is correct.
   - However, the loop in `func_1` iterates over the list `b` in reverse, which is unnecessary and incorrect because `b` is built by appending elements from `a` based on the commands, not by the remaining elements after each command.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The final result should be returned in the correct order, but the current implementation returns the results in reverse order. This is a minor issue since the results can be reversed to match the expected order.

5. **Correct Logic:**
   - To correctly implement the logic, the function should:
     - Initialize `p` to 1.
     - Iterate through the string `s` and for each command:
       - Compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` and append the result to `ans`.
       - Remove the corresponding element from `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R').
     - Return the list `ans` without reversing it.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` should build the list `b` by processing the commands and computing the product of the remaining elements, but it does not do so correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not follow the logic specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it incorrectly builds the list `b` and does not compute the product of the remaining elements before each command is processed.
