You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'L') or `a[r]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'R'), with `l` starting at 0 and `r` starting at `n-1`, and moving towards each other based on the characters in `s`. The final positions of `l` and `r` will be `n` (after the loop) since `l` will be incremented until it reaches `n` and `r` will be decremented until it becomes -1.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `p` is the product of all elements in the list `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a reversed list of all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of 'L' and 'R'). It performs operations based on the string `s` and returns a reversed list of all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a reversed list of all intermediate results of `p` from each iteration of the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
