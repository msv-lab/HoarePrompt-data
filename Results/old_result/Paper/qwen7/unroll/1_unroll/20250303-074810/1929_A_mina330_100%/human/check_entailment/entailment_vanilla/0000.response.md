### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the next smallest, and the largest element is paired with the second largest, leading to the maximum possible differences.

3. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array and prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array.

4. **Verification:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest values are at the ends.
   - The difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array is maximized because these two values contribute the most to the sum of differences when placed at the ends.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are the same, sorting them will still result in the same value for the maximum and minimum elements, yielding a difference of 0.
   - The program handles arrays of different sizes and values correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

**Correctness: True**
