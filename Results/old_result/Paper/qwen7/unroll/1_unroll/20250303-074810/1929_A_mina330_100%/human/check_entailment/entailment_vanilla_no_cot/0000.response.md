Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program sorts the array and prints the difference between the last and first elements, which only gives the maximum possible difference but does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\). The correct approach is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This way, we ensure that the differences are maximized.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            max_beauty += a[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)

func()
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by pairing the smallest and largest elements appropriately.
