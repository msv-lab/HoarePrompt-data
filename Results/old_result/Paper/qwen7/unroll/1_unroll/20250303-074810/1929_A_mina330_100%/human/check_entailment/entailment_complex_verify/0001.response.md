### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. However, the provided solution only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array. This approach does not necessarily maximize the overall sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array and calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements only gives the maximum possible difference between two elements, not the maximum sum of differences between all consecutive elements.
   - Consider the example where the array is \([1, 100, 2]\). Sorting this array results in \([1, 2, 100]\), and the difference between the largest and smallest elements is \(100 - 1 = 99\). However, the actual beauty is \((100 - 1) + (2 - 100) = 99 - 99 = 0\), which is not maximized.

5. **Example Counter-Argument**:
   - In the example \([1, 100, 2]\), the correct maximum beauty is 0, but the program outputs 99. This shows that the program does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. Sorting the array and finding the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not guarantee the maximum sum of differences between consecutive elements.

**Correctness:** **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
