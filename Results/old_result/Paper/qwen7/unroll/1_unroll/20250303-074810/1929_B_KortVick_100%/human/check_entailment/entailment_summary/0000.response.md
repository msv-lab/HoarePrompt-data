Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored based on the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A square grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \).
     - If true, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \left\lceil \frac{k}{2} \right\rceil \).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - When \( 4n - 2 = k \):
     - Each diagonal must have at least one colored cell.
     - Since there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need to color at least half of them plus one (because each cell can belong to at most two diagonals).
     - Hence, \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \). This matches the formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) since \( k = 4n - 2 \).
   - When \( 4n - 2 \neq k \):
     - We need to color enough cells to cover at least \( k \) diagonals.
     - The ceiling function \( \left\lceil \frac{k}{2} \right\rceil \) ensures that we round up to the nearest whole number, which is necessary because we cannot color a fraction of a cell.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cells to be colored based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
