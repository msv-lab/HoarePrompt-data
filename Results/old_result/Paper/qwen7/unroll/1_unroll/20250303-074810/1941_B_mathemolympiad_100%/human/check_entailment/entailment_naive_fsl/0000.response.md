Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the program only checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and prints 'NO' immediately, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of making all elements zero.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The expected output is "YES" because, as shown in the example, it is possible to make all elements zero. However, the program will incorrectly output "NO" because it checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and stops early.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that after performing the operations, all elements of the array become zero. The current implementation does not fully check this condition.
