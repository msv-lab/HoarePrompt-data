Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and applying the specified operation as many times as necessary to check if all elements can be reduced to zero. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Operation Application**: The program subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i + 1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i + 2]`. This is not the correct way to simulate the operation described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the correct operation should be:
   - `a[i-1] = a[i-1] - 1`
   - `a[i] = a[i] - 2`
   - `a[i+1] = a[i+1] - 1`

2. **Index Handling**: The loop starts from `0` and goes up to `n-2`, which means it skips the last two elements of the array. This is incorrect because the operation can be applied to any index `i` where `2 \leq i \leq n-2`.

3. **Negative Check**: The program checks if any element becomes negative during the iteration and prints 'NO' immediately. However, the problem does not specify that the array must be non-negative throughout the process; it only needs to end up with all zeros.

4. **Final Check**: The final check for the last two elements being zero is correct, but the overall logic for determining whether the array can be made zero is flawed due to the incorrect application of the operation.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
