### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure we cover all aspects:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of the array along with the array itself.

2. **Checking for Negative Values:**
   - The program iterates through the array and checks if any element becomes negative. If any element becomes negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This is correct because the operations defined in the problem cannot produce negative values, so if a negative value appears, it means the array cannot be made entirely zero.

3. **Applying Operations:**
   - The program applies the operations correctly. For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the number of operations needed (`opNum`), which is `a[i]`. It then updates the array by subtracting `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2*opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`. This ensures that the operations are applied as per the problem statement.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If either `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]` is not zero, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. This final check ensures that the array can indeed be made zero if the operations were applied correctly without any negative values appearing.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.
