Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits. Each digit in the first string is the maximum value between the corresponding digits of the two input strings, and each digit in the second string is the minimum value between the corresponding digits of the two input strings. This process is repeated for the number of iterations specified by the user, with the same logic applied to each pair of input strings.
