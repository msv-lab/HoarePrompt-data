You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits. For each iteration of the loop, a new string `new` and `new2` are generated based on the comparison of two input strings `a` and `b`. The first string `new` contains the maximum value at each position where `a` and `b` differ or when they are different from the previous matching pair. The second string `new2` contains the minimum value at each position where `a` and `b` differ or when they are different from the previous matching pair. After all iterations, the final `new` and `new2` strings are printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Conversion:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` representing integers `x` and `y`.
   - It converts these strings into lists of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two new lists `new` and `new2` are initialized with `None` values.
   - These lists will store the maximized and minimized versions of the numbers `x` and `y` respectively.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the digits of `a` and `b`:
     - If the current digits of `a` and `b` are equal, it sets `new[i]` and `new2[i]` to the maximum and minimum of those digits, respectively.
     - If the digits are not equal, it sets `new[i]` and `new2[i]` to the maximum and minimum of those digits, respectively.
     - After handling the first differing digit, it continues to set subsequent digits of `new` and `new2` to minimize and maximize the remaining digits, respectively.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximized version (`new`) and the minimized version (`new2`) of the numbers `x` and `y`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Handling Equal Digits:**
   - When the digits at the same position in `a` and `b` are equal, the program correctly sets both `new[i]` and `new2[i]` to that digit.
   
2. **Handling Different Digits:**
   - When the digits at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the program correctly sets `new[i]` to the maximum of the two digits and `new2[i]` to the minimum of the two digits.
   - This ensures that the product of the resulting numbers is maximized.

3. **Subsequent Digits:**
   - After handling the first differing digit, the program sets the remaining digits of `new` and `new2` to minimize and maximize the remaining digits, respectively. This ensures that the remaining part of the numbers are also optimized.

### Conclusion:

The given program follows the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits as required. The logic is sound and correctly implements the described strategy.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
