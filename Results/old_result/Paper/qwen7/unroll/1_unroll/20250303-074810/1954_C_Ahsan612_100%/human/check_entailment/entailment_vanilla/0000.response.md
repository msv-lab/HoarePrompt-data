Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Conversion:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` representing integers `x` and `y`.
   - It converts these strings into lists of integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two new lists `new` and `new2` are initialized with `None` values.
   - These lists will store the maximized and minimized versions of the numbers `x` and `y` respectively.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the digits of `a` and `b`:
     - If the current digits of `a` and `b` are equal, it sets `new[i]` and `new2[i]` to the maximum and minimum of those digits, respectively.
     - If the digits are not equal, it sets `new[i]` and `new2[i]` to the maximum and minimum of those digits, respectively.
     - After handling the first differing digit, it continues to set subsequent digits of `new` and `new2` to minimize and maximize the remaining digits, respectively.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximized version (`new`) and the minimized version (`new2`) of the numbers `x` and `y`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Handling Equal Digits:**
   - When the digits at the same position in `a` and `b` are equal, the program correctly sets both `new[i]` and `new2[i]` to that digit.
   
2. **Handling Different Digits:**
   - When the digits at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the program correctly sets `new[i]` to the maximum of the two digits and `new2[i]` to the minimum of the two digits.
   - This ensures that the product of the resulting numbers is maximized.

3. **Subsequent Digits:**
   - After handling the first differing digit, the program sets the remaining digits of `new` and `new2` to minimize and maximize the remaining digits, respectively. This ensures that the remaining part of the numbers are also optimized.

### Conclusion:

The given program follows the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping digits as required. The logic is sound and correctly implements the described strategy.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
