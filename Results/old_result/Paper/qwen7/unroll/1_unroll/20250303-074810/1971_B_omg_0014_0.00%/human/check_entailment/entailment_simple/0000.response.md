Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Set Usage**: The program uses a set `a` to store unique characters in the string `s`. If the size of the set is exactly 2 (`len(a) == 2`), it prints 'NO'. This logic is correct because if a string has only two unique characters, any permutation of the string will still have those same two characters, making it impossible to create a different string.

3. **Sorting Logic**: 
   - If the string `s` is already sorted (in ascending order), the program prints the reverse sorted string `c`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For strings with more than two unique characters, the program correctly identifies that a different string can be formed and prints 'YES' followed by a possible rearrangement.
   - For strings with exactly two unique characters, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

5. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a possible rearranged string for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all described scenarios and produces the expected output based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
