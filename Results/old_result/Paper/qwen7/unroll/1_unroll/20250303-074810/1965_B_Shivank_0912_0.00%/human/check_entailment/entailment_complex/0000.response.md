Reasoning:

The function `func_1` generates a fixed sequence of the first 25 powers of 2 for each test case. This sequence ensures that every integer from 1 to 32768 (which is \(2^{15}\)) can be formed as a subsequence sum, because these numbers are distinct and cover all possible sums up to 32768. However, it fails to meet the requirement of not having any subsequence sum equal to `k`.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 8` and `k = 8`. The sequence generated by the function is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768]`. Here, the subsequence `[8]` sums to 8, which violates the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.

Therefore, the function does not correctly generate a sequence that meets all the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
