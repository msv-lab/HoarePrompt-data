You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each string `s`, it counts the number of consecutive character pairs where a '0' is immediately followed by a '1'. If such a pair exists, the count is decremented by 1. Finally, it prints the adjusted count for each string `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 1. This variable will keep track of the number of pieces.
   - `flag` is initialized to `False`. This flag will indicate whether a transition from '0' to '1' has been observed.

3. **Loop Through the String**:
   - The loop iterates through the string `s` until the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j + 1]`, it means there is a transition between '0' and '1'.
     - `count` is incremented because a new piece is needed.
     - If the transition is from '0' to '1', the `flag` is set to `True`.

4. **Adjustment for Flag**:
   - After the loop, if the `flag` is `True`, it means there was at least one transition from '0' to '1'. In this case, we subtract 1 from `count` because the last piece can be combined with the previous piece to form a sorted binary string.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `count` is printed, which represents the minimum number of pieces required.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic against the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `11010`
  - Transitions: `1 -> 0` (at index 2), `0 -> 1` (at index 3)
  - `count` increments twice: `1 -> 2 -> 3`
  - Transition from '0' to '1' observed, so `count` is adjusted: `3 - 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Expected: `3`)

- **Test Case 2**: `00000000`
  - No transitions, so `count` remains `1`
  - Output: `1` (Expected: `1`)

- **Test Case 3**: `1`
  - No transitions, so `count` remains `1`
  - Output: `1` (Expected: `1`)

- **Test Case 4**: `10`
  - Transition: `1 -> 0` (at index 1)
  - `count` increments once: `1 -> 2`
  - Transition from '0' to '1' not observed, so no adjustment
  - Output: `2` (Expected: `2`)

- **Test Case 5**: `0001111`
  - No transitions, so `count` remains `1`
  - Output: `1` (Expected: `1`)

- **Test Case 6**: `0110`
  - Transition: `0 -> 1` (at index 1), `1 -> 0` (at index 3)
  - `count` increments twice: `1 -> 2 -> 3`
  - Transition from '0' to '1' observed, so `count` is adjusted: `3 - 1 = 2`
  - Output: `2` (Expected: `2`)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the test case `11010`. The expected output should be `3`, but the program outputs `2`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
