Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and calculating the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic within the loop seems flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and the subsequent addition to `ans` do not correctly account for the condition that `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

To properly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and check for each `a` how many values of `b` from 1 to `m` satisfy the condition. This involves computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Given the current implementation, it appears that the function is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
