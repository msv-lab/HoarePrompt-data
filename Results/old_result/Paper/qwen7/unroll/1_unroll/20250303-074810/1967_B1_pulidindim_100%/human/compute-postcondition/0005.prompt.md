You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; for each i in the range(t), n and m are integers where n is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive and m is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive; ans is the final value calculated after executing the loop for the given n and m, which is an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^6, with the sum of `n` or `m` over all test cases not exceeding 2·10^6. The function returns results based on the values of `n` and `m` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
