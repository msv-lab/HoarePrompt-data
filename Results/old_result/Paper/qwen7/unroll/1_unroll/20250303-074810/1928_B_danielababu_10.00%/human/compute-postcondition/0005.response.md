Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements from the end of `arr` to the current position.**

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `ans` is a list where each element is the product of all elements from the end of `arr` to the current position.
- `tem` is 1.

The code snippet `return ans` simply returns the list `ans`. Since no further operations are performed on `ans` within the given code snippet, the value of `ans` remains as it was calculated before the return statement. Therefore, the program returns the list `ans` which contains the product of all elements from the end of `arr` to the current position for each element in the list.
