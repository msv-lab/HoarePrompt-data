Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `arr` is a list of positive integers.
   - `i` is initialized using `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`, which means `i` will start from `len(arr) - 1` and decrement until it reaches `-1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `arr` is a list of positive integers, its state remains unchanged.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Initially, `i` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, so we need to ensure that this value is valid and non-negative.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` being greater than or equal to 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
