#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i in the array a.

def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained from user input, split and converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes user input to return a list of integers. Specifically, it first reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the length of an array, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array. The function then returns a list containing all these integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers representing the elements of the array a.

    #The program returns a sorted list of integers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input from the user, reading multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an array of integers, sorts the array, and collects these sorted arrays into a list. Finally, it returns this list of sorted arrays.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of integers where each integer is within the range [1, 10^9].
def func_5():

    #The program returns a map object containing strings converted from the input split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input from the user, splitting the input into separate strings based on spaces, and then converts these strings into a map object containing integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_6()` are defined or used in the provided context. The function does not take any parameters and returns a list obtained from user input, but it does not seem to contribute to solving the described problem.
def func_6():

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6()` accepts no parameters and returns a list of characters entered by the user through input.

def func_7():

    #The program returns a list of strings, which are the elements of the input array 'a' converted to strings and sorted alphabetically.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input consisting of multiple space-separated integers and returns a list of these integers converted to strings, sorted in alphabetical order. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `n` as described in the annotation; instead, it directly reads a single line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts them to strings, and sorts them.

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `arr`; `tem` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of elements in `arr`, starting from 1 (the initial value of `tem`). `tem` will be equal to the product of all elements in `arr` because it gets multiplied by each element in `arr` during each iteration, but its final value is not appended to `ans`.
    return ans
    #`ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of elements in `arr`, and `tem` is equal to the product of all elements in `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative product of elements in `arr`. Additionally, it returns the variable `tem`, which holds the product of all elements in `arr`.

    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements from the end of `arr` to the current position.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` represents the product of all elements from the last element of `arr` to the current element. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
