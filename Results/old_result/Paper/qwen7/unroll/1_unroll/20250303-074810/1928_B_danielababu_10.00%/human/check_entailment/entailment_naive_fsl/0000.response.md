Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions do not implement the required functionality. The problem requires implementing a function that finds the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. However, none of the provided functions attempt to solve this problem. Instead, they contain various utility functions that do not contribute to solving the given problem. For instance:

- `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7` are utility functions that read input in different ways but do not process it according to the problem description.
- `func_8` and `func_9` compute prefix and suffix products, which are irrelevant to the problem at hand.

Since the provided functions do not attempt to solve the problem described, the program is incorrect.
