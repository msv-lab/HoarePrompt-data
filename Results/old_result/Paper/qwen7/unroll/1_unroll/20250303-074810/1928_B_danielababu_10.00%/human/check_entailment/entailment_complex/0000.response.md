Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. The provided solution iterates through each test case, constructs a new array by subtracting each element from the maximum element in the original array plus one, sorts the new array, and then determines the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - **func_3()**: Reads the array elements for each test case.
   - **Main Logic**: The main logic is encapsulated in the provided code snippet, which correctly implements the transformation and calculation required to solve the problem.

3. **Main Code Snippet Analysis**:
   - **n = func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **arr = func_3()**: Reads the array elements for the current test case.
   - **m = max(arr)**: Finds the maximum value in the array.
   - **new = []**: Initializes a new list to store transformed values.
   - **Loop**: Iterates through the array, transforming each element to `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - **Sorting**: Sorts the new list.
   - **Set Calculation**: Uses a set to find unique values in the sorted list.
   - **Print**: Outputs the size of the set, which represents the maximum frequency of any number in the transformed array.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` ensures that the new array contains values from 1 to n, which simplifies the problem to finding the maximum frequency of any number in a transformed array.
   - Sorting the new array allows for easy determination of the maximum frequency using a set.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
