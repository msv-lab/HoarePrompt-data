Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, and lists a and b. It returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for t, n, m, k, a, and b.**

- For each test case, it checks if `t` is within the range 1 to \(10^4\).
- It verifies that `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
- It ensures `k` is an even integer within the range 2 to \(2 \cdot \min(n, m)\).
- It validates that `a` is a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and \(10^6\).
- It confirms that `b` is a list of `m` integers, each between 1 and \(10^6\).
- The sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases in a test does not exceed \(4 \cdot 10^5\).

The function processes these inputs and returns outputs based on the specified conditions.
