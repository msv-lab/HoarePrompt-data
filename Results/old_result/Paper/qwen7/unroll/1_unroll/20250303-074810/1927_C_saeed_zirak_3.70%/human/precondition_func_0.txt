t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5; k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m); a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6; the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
