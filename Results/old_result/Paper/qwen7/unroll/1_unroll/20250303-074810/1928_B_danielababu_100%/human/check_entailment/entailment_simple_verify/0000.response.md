### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and its behavior against the problem description and the example input.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \(a\) of length \(n\), we need to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation \(p\) to the array \(a\). Formally, \(a_i := a_i + p_i\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function Definitions**:
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc., are defined but are not utilized in the main logic. They are placeholders or might be intended for other purposes.
   
2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic is encapsulated in the loop that iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case:
     - `n = func_1()` retrieves the length of the array.
     - `arr = sorted(list(set(func_3())))` sorts and removes duplicates from the array.
     - `m = max(arr)` finds the maximum value in the sorted unique array.
     - A loop iterates over the sorted unique array to calculate the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.

#### Detailed Breakdown:
- **Removing Duplicates**: By sorting and removing duplicates (`sorted(list(set(func_3())))`), the code assumes that the array has unique values. This is a critical assumption that may not hold for all test cases.
- **Finding Maximum Value**: `m = max(arr)` finds the maximum value in the array, which is a step towards understanding the distribution of values.
- **Calculating Maximum Equal Elements**: The loop calculates the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by considering the difference between the current value and the maximum value in the array. This is done using `bisect_left` to find the position where the current value plus the length of the array would fit in the sorted array.

#### Example Input Analysis:
Consider the example input:
```
3
2
1 2
4
7 1 4 1
3
103 102 104
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - Array: `[1, 2]`
  - Sorted Unique Array: `[1, 2]`
  - Maximum Value: `2`
  - Loop: 
    - For `1`: `bisect_left([1, 2], 1 + 2) = bisect_left([1, 2], 3) = 2` (index 2)
    - For `2`: `bisect_left([1, 2], 2 + 2) = bisect_left([1, 2], 4) = 2` (index 2)
  - Result: `max(2 - 0, 2 - 1) = 2`

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Array: `[7, 1, 4, 1]`
  - Sorted Unique Array: `[1, 4, 7]`
  - Maximum Value: `7`
  - Loop:
    - For `1`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 1 + 4) = bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 5) = 2` (index 2)
    - For `4`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 4 + 4) = bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 8) = 3` (index 3)
    - For `7`: `bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 7 + 4) = bisect_left([1, 4, 7], 11) = 3` (index 3)
  - Result: `max(2 - 0, 3 - 1, 3 - 2) = 2`

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Array: `[103, 102, 104]`
  - Sorted Unique Array: `[102, 103, 104]`
  - Maximum Value: `104`
  - Loop:
    - For `102`: `bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 102 + 3) = bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 105) = 3` (index 3)
    - For `103`: `bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 103 + 3) = bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 106) = 3` (index 3)
    - For `104`: `bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 104 + 3) = bisect_left([102, 103, 104], 107) = 3` (index 3)
  - Result: `max(3 - 0, 3 - 1, 3 - 2) = 3`
