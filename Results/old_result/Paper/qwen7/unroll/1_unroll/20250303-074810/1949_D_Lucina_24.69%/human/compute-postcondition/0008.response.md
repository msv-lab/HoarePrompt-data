Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the input for each index, `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the input for each index, `xx` is a list containing n elements, each being the input string received during each iteration of the loop, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `sb = []` initializes an empty list named `sb`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, or `sa`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
