Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from all inputs for that index, `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from all inputs for that index, `xx` is a list containing n elements, each being a string input received during the loop iterations.
