Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the input for each index, `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the input for each index, `xx` is a list containing n elements, each being the input string received during each iteration of the loop, `sa` is a list containing indices where 'F' was counted but not 'S', `sb` is a list containing indices where 'S' was counted but not 'F'.
