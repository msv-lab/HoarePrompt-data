Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which ranges from 1 to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 and that the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` remains within the range `[1, n + 1]`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` is within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 24\).

Since the other variables (`a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`) are not directly involved in the loop condition, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24**
