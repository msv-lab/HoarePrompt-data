Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24 remains valid, and now `n` also holds the specific value entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged.
