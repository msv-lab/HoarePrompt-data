Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly processes the input by counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each row and storing these counts in lists `a` and `b`. This step ensures that the counts are accurate and can be used to determine how to fill in the undecided cells ('?').

2. **Categorization**: The program categorizes the rows into `sa` and `sb` based on the counts of 'F' and 'S'. Specifically, `sa` contains indices of rows with more 'F' than 'S', and `sb` contains indices of rows with more 'S' than 'F'. This categorization is correct and necessary for determining how to fill in the undecided cells.

3. **Decision Logic**: 
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the program fills in the undecided cells ('?') with 'F' under certain conditions.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the program fills in the undecided cells ('?') with 'S' under certain conditions.
   
   These conditions are designed to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of the scenarios. The logic here is sound and follows the problem statement requirements.

4. **Output Generation**: The program generates the output by iterating over the rows and filling in the undecided cells ('?') based on the conditions derived from the `sa` and `sb` lists. The conditions are correctly applied to ensure that the resulting grid meets the problem's constraints.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` by appending these indices to `sa` or `sb` as needed, ensuring that the final grid is complete and meets the problem's requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to generate a valid transition video plan that satisfies the problem's constraints.

Correctness: **True**
