The function processes a symmetric 2D grid of size n x n, where each cell contains a character indicating the type of transition video between scenarios (F for funny, S for scary, ? for undecided, or . for no video). It counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each row and stores these counts in lists `a` and `b`. Based on the counts, it categorizes rows into two groups: `sa` for rows with more 'F' than 'S', and `sb` for rows with more 'S' than 'F'. If the number of rows in `sa` is greater than or equal to the number of rows in `sb`, it fills in the undecided cells ('?') with 'F' under certain conditions; otherwise, it fills them with 'S'. The function then prints the modified grid.
