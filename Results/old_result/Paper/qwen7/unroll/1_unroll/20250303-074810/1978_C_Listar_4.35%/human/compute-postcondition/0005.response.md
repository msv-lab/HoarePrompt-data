Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12; `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`; `n` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The code `l = func_1(n, k)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `k`, and assigns the return value of `func_1` to the variable `l`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `l`. However, we know that `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. All other variables retain their initial conditions.
