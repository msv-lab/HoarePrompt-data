To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the functions step by step.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- This function takes the input values \( n \) and \( k \).
- It checks if \( k \) is odd; if so, it returns `(0, 0)` because an even Manhattan value cannot be achieved if \( k \) is odd.
- It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \):
  - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
  - If \( n \) is even, the maximum value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
- It checks if this maximum value is less than \( k \); if so, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution exists.
- Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- This function aims to construct a permutation with the given \( n \) and \( k \).
- It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to \( n \).
- It iteratively modifies the list to achieve the required Manhattan value:
  - It starts from the end of the list and moves elements to the beginning if necessary to reduce \( k \).
  - It ensures that the Manhattan value matches \( k \).

### Analysis of `func_3`:
- This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
- It takes a list `l` as input and prints each element separated by spaces.

### Analysis of `func_4`:
- This function integrates the logic of `func_2` and `func_1`.
- It first calls `func_2` to validate the input and get \( n \) and \( k \).
- If `func_2` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO" and exits.
- Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Overall Correctness:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies when no solution exists.
- The logic in `func_1` constructs a permutation that achieves the required Manhattan value.
- The functions `func_3` and `func_4` handle the output format correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
