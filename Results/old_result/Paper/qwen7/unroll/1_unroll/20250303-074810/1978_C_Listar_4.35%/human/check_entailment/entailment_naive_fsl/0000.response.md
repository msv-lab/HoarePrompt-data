Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not fully address the problem description. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not handle all possible cases correctly. 

1. **Function `func_2`**: This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. However, it does not provide a way to construct a permutation that achieves the exact Manhattan value `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation based on the value of `k` and the length `n`. However, it does not handle all possible values of `k` correctly. For example, consider the case where `n = 3` and `k = 1`. The function should return a permutation like `[3, 1, 2]` or `[2, 1, 3]`, but it does not guarantee this.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function prints "YES" and the constructed permutation. However, it does not handle the case where no valid permutation exists.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function integrates the above functions to solve the problem. However, it does not handle all cases correctly. For instance, it does not handle the case where `k` is odd, which is not possible since the Manhattan value of a permutation is always even.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 1`
- Expected Output: A permutation like `[3, 1, 2]` or `[2, 1, 3]`
- Actual Output: The provided code does not guarantee to produce such a permutation.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain cases as required by the problem description.
