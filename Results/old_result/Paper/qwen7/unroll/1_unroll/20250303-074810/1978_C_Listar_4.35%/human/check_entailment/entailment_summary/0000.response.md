### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find a permutation of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).
   - If no such permutation exists, we should output "No".

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible \( k \) based on \( n \).
   - If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible \( k \), it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - It manipulates a list `l` containing integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It moves the last element to the front repeatedly until \( k \) becomes zero or less.
   - If the condition \( 1 + i > k \) is met during the iteration, it stops early.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` and ensures the list represents a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the solution by calling `func_2` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If \( k \) is odd, `func_2` correctly returns `(0, 0)`, which causes `func_4` to print "NO".
  - If \( k \) is even and within the valid range, `func_2` returns \( n \) and \( k \), allowing `func_1` to generate the permutation.
  - `func_1` ensures that the generated permutation has the correct Manhattan value by manipulating the list according to the specified rules.
  - `func_3` correctly prints the permutation if it exists.

Given the logical flow and the correctness of each function, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
