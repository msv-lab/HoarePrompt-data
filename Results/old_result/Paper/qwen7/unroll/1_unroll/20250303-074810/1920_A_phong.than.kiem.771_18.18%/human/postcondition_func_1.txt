This function processes input based on two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, it splits the input line on spaces and converts the resulting items to integers if `to_int` is non-empty; otherwise, it returns the split items as strings. If `space` is False, it treats the input line as a sequence of characters and returns them as a list. The function ultimately returns a list of integers if `to_int` is processed, or a list of strings or characters based on the `space` parameter.
