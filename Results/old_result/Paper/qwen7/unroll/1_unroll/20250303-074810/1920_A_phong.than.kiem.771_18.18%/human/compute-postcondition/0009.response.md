Output State: **The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the `items` list.**

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `line` is the first input line which is an integer `n`.
- `items` is a list of either the strings obtained by splitting `line` on spaces (if `space` is True) or the characters of the input line (if `space` is False).
- `to_int` is True.

The code snippet:
```python
return [int(i) for i in items]
```
This code converts each item in the `items` list to an integer. Since `to_int` is True, it implies that the items are either strings that represent integers or characters that need to be converted to integers.

Therefore, the program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the `items` list.
