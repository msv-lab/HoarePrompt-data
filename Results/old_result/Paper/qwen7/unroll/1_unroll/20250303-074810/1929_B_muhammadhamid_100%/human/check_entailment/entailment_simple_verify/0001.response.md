### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses a loop to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It handles the special case where \( k = 1 \) by printing `1`.
   - For other cases, it checks if \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \). This simplifies to \( k \leq 4n - 4 \).
     - If true, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic seems to handle the simplest case correctly (`k = 1`).
   - The condition \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) is used to determine when to use \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).
   - The formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) is used when \( k > 4n - 4 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( k = 1 \), the solution prints `1`, which is correct.
   - For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), the solution uses \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \), which is generally correct because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals.
   - For \( k > 4n - 4 \), the solution uses \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \), which ensures that we cover all required diagonals.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - The examples provided in the problem statement match the expected outputs based on the given logic.
   - However, let's verify the logic more rigorously by considering specific examples and the constraints.

6. **Detailed Verification:**
   - Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - According to the logic, since \( k = 10 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \) is false, it should print \( \frac{10}{2} + 1 = 6 \).
     - This matches the example output, which is `6`.

   - Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 9 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \) is false, it should print \( \frac{9}{2} + 1 = 5 \).
     - This matches the example output, which is `5`.

   - Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 4 \leq 4 \times 3 - 4 = 8 \) is true, it should print \( \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 \).
     - This matches the example output, which is `2`.

   - Consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \):
     - Total diagonals: \( 4 \times 3 - 2 = 10 \).
     - Since \( k = 1 \), it prints `1`.
     - This matches the example output, which is `1`.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the given solution appears to be correct for all tested cases and matches the problem requirements.
