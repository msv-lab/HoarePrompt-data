Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It properly adjusts the hour for times between 13 and 23 by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero when necessary.
- It correctly prints '12' for the '00' hour and '12' for the '12' hour.
- The AM/PM indicator is correctly set based on whether the hour is 12 or greater.
- The function processes multiple test cases as specified by the input count `t`.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to be functioning as intended without any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
