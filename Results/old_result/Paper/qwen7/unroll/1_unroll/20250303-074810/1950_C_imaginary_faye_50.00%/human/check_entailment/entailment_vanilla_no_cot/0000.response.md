Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format according to the problem description. It handles all edge cases, such as `00` (which should be `12` in 12-hour format) and `12` (which remains `12` in 12-hour format). The program also correctly determines whether to use `AM` or `PM` based on the hour. The logic is sound and the output matches the expected format for all given test cases.
