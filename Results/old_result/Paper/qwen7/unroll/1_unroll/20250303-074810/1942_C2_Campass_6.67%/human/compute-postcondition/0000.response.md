Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the standard input, splits it into multiple values, and converts each value to an integer. This lambda function does not assign any values to existing variables or change their states. It only defines a new function `R`. Therefore, the initial values of `t` remain unchanged, and the new lambda function `R` is defined.
