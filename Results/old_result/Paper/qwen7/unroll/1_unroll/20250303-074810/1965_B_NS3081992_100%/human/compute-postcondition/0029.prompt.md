You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'
        #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is 1, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, and `n` is not equal to 2.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = l-1` (since `range(2, l)` generates numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `l`). For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain `[2, 3]` plus all powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\).
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4].
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: ans is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and `ans` is either `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]` if `k` is 1, or `[1, 2, 4, 3, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2` followed by the remaining elements of the original `ans` list if `k` is not 1.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string containing the length of the list `ans` followed by a space-separated string of its elements.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string containing the length of the list `ans` followed by a space-separated string of its elements.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'

Case_2: The program returns a string containing the length of the list `ans` followed by a space-separated string of its elements.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
