Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range of `func_10()`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer value. Therefore, the state of `func_10()` must be such that it returns a positive integer.
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, its specific value doesn't matter for the loop to execute; what matters is that the loop will run for the number of times returned by `func_10()`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer, because this will determine how many times the loop will execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are related to `func_10()`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
