Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is 1, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, and `n` is not equal to 2.

Explanation: The loop iterates from 2 to `l-1` (since `range(2, l)` generates numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `l`). For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will contain `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]`, where the last element is `2^(l-1)`.
