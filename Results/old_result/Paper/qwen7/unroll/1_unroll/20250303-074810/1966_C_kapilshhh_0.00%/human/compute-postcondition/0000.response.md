Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and all other variables are not yet assigned values.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tc`). This integer is converted to an integer type using `int()`. Since this is the first piece of code, no other variables are assigned values yet.
