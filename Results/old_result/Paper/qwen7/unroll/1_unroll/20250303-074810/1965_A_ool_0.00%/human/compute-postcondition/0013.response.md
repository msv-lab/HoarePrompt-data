Postcondition: `A` is True, `not_c` is True, `arr[0]` is equal to 1, and `set_` is [1]. This is because the loop does not execute due to the condition `not_c` being True, so `A` toggles from its initial state of True to False and then back to True, while `not_c` remains True. The values of `arr[0]` and `set_` remain unchanged.
