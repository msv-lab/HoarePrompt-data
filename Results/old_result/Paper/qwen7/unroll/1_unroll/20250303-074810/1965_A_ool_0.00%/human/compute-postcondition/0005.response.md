Output State: **`A` is False, and `arr[0]` is equal to 1, `set_` is [1]**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the elements in the set `set_`. Since `set_` initially contains only one element, 1, sorting does not change its content. Therefore, the values of `A`, `arr[0]`, and `set_` remain unchanged.
