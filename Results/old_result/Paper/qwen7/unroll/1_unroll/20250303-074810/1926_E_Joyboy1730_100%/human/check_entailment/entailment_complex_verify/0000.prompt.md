You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    for _ in range(t):

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the given logic within the loop. For each test case defined by `t`, the program processes values of `n` and `k` to compute and print specific integers according to the described algorithm. Specifically, it calculates a sequence `L` where each element `m` is derived from `n` by repeatedly setting `m = (n + 1) // 2` and decrementing `n` by `m`. Then, it determines and prints an integer based on the position `k` within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence \( L \) where each element \( m \) is derived by repeatedly halving \( n \) (with rounding up) until \( n \) becomes zero. It then determines and prints an integer based on the position \( k \) within the cumulative sum of elements in \( L \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the correct order of laying down the cards as specified. According to the problem description, the cards should be laid down in the following order:

1. All odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest.
2. All cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest.
3. All cards that are three times an odd number from smallest to largest.
4. And so on...

However, the program attempts to lay down the cards in a different manner. It calculates the number of cards that can be laid down at each step and tries to directly determine the k-th card without maintaining the correct order. This approach fails to correctly simulate the process of laying down the cards in the specified sequence.

For example, consider the input `7 4`. According to the problem description, the order of laying down the cards should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4. However, the program would incorrectly determine the 4th card based on its current logic, which does not match the expected output of 7.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to maintain a list of cards that can be laid down at each step and process them in the correct order.
