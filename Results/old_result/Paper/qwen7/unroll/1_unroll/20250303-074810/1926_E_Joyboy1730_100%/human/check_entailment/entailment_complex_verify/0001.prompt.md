You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the given logic within the loop. For each test case defined by `t`, the program processes values of `n` and `k` to compute and print specific integers according to the described algorithm. Specifically, it calculates a sequence `L` where each element `m` is derived from `n` by repeatedly setting `m = (n + 1) // 2` and decrementing `n` by `m`. Then, it determines and prints an integer based on the position `k` within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a sequence \( L \) where each element \( m \) is derived by repeatedly halving \( n \) (with rounding up) until \( n \) becomes zero. It then determines and prints an integer based on the position \( k \) within the cumulative sum of elements in \( L \). The function reads \( t \) test cases from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4 \), and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **List Construction (`L`):**
   - The list `L` is constructed using a while loop.
   - In each iteration, `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`.
   - This loop continues until `n` becomes zero.
   - The purpose of this loop is to determine how many odd multiples of increasing powers of 2 can be laid down with the available cards.

3. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - A variable `tot` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - A variable `pow` is initialized to 1 to represent the current power of 2.
   - The program iterates over the list `L` and checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`.
   - If `k` is within this range, it calculates the k-th card as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - `tot` is updated by adding `a` to it.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2 to move to the next power of 2.

### Analysis of the Logic:

1. **List Construction (`L`):**
   - The logic correctly identifies how many cards of each type (odd, twice an odd, three times an odd, etc.) can be laid down.
   - However, the construction of `L` might not be necessary for finding the k-th card directly.

2. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the range of cards for each power of 2 and finds the exact card within that range.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card for the current power of 2.

### Correctness Check:

Given the example provided:
- For `n = 7` and `k = 1`, the output is `1` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the output is `3` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the output is `5` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 4`, the output is `7` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the output is `2` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 6`, the output is `6` (correct).
- For `n = 7` and `k = 7`, the output is `4` (correct).

The program handles the examples correctly, and the logic appears sound.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
