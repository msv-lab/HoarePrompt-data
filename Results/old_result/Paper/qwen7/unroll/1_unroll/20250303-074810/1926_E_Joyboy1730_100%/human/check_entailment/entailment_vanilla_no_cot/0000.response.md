Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down according to the specified rules. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Card Distribution Logic**:
   - The program calculates how many cards are laid down at each step (i.e., for multiples of 1, 2, 3, etc., where the multiplier is an odd number).
   - It uses a list `L` to store these counts.
   - For each count `m` in `L`, it subtracts `m` from `n` and appends `m` to `L`. This effectively simulates laying down the cards in the required order.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - After determining the distribution of cards, the program iterates over the counts stored in `L`.
   - It keeps track of the cumulative count `tot` of cards laid down.
   - When `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]` for some count `a` in `L`, it calculates the exact card using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`, where `pow` is the current multiplier (starting from 1 and doubling with each step).

4. **Output**: The program prints the k-th card for each test case.

Given the example and the problem statement, the program correctly identifies the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the program is correct.
