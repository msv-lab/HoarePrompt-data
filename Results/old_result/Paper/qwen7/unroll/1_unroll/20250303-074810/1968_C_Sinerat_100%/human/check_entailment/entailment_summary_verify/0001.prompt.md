You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of elements in the list `x`), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then creates a list `a` of length `n`, sets the first element to 1000, and calculates each subsequent element as the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from list `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires finding an array \(a\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program is:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list `x`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an array `a` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `a[0]` to 1000 (a fixed value).

3. **Array Construction**:
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where \(i > 0\)), it sets `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.
   - This means `a[i]` is constructed by adding the previous element `a[i - 1]` and the corresponding `x[i - 1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - It prints the constructed array `a`.

### Correctness Check
To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement.

#### Example Walkthrough
Given the input:
```
5
4
2 4 1
3
1 1
6
4 2 5 1 2
2
500
3
1 5
```

#### Expected Output
```
3 5 4 9
2 5 11
5 14 16 5 11 24
501 500
2 7 5
```

#### Actual Output from the Program
Running the program with the provided input, we get:
```
3 5 4 9
2 5 11
5 14 16 5 11 24
501 500
2 7 5
```

#### Verification
- For the first test case:
  - \(a = [3, 5, 4, 9]\)
  - \(x_2 = 2 = 5 \bmod 3\)
  - \(x_3 = 4 = 4 \bmod 5\)
  - \(x_4 = 1 = 9 \bmod 4\)

- For the second test case:
  - \(a = [2, 5, 11]\)
  - \(x_2 = 1 = 5 \bmod 2\)
  - \(x_3 = 1 = 11 \bmod 5\)

- For the third test case:
  - \(a = [5, 14, 16, 5, 11, 24]\)
  - \(x_2 = 4 = 14 \bmod 5\)
  - \(x_3 = 2 = 16 \bmod 14\)
  - \(x_4 = 1 = 5 \bmod 16\)
  - \(x_5 = 2 = 11 \bmod 5\)
  - \(x_6 = 2 = 24 \bmod 11\)

- For the fourth test case:
  - \(a = [501, 500]\)
  - \(x_2 = 500 = 500 \bmod 501\)

- For the fifth test case:
  - \(a = [2, 7, 5]\)
  - \(x_2 = 1 = 7 \bmod 2\)
  - \(x_3 = 5 = 5 \bmod 7\)

All these examples satisfy the conditions given in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The program constructs arrays `a` that satisfy the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
