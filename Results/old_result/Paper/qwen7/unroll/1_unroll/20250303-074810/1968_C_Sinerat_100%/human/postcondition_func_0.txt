The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of elements in the list `x`), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then creates a list `a` of length `n`, sets the first element to 1000, and calculates each subsequent element as the sum of the previous element and the corresponding element from list `x`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.
