Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities. Specifically, the program uses a dynamic programming approach to precompute the minimum cost to reach each city from its closest city, but it does not handle the general case correctly.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results for some queries. For example, for the query `1 4`, the program calculates the cost as `3` using the precomputed values, but the correct minimum cost should be `1` because we can directly travel from city 1 to city 4 paying only `1` coin (since city 2 is the closest city to city 1, and city 3 is the closest city to city 2).

The program fails to correctly compute the minimum cost for direct travels between cities that are not adjacent in the precomputed values. This is because the precomputation logic does not account for direct travel costs correctly for all possible pairs of cities.
