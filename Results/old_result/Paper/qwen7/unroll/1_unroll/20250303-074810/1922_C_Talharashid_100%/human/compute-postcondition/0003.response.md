Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `a` of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, along with two integers `x` and `y` for each query, where 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n. For each query, it checks if the element at index `x` is less than the element at index `y` and returns `True` if true, otherwise returns `False`.**

This means the function takes a list of integers `a` and handles multiple queries, each consisting of two indices `x` and `y`. It then compares the elements at these indices in the list and returns `True` if the element at index `x` is less than the element at index `y`, and `False` otherwise.
