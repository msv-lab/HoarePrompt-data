Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of `n` integers in strictly increasing order and handles `m` queries. For each query consisting of two distinct integers `x` and `y`, it computes and prints the difference between the values stored in dictionaries `d1` and `d2`. Dictionary `d1` contains values computed in a forward pass, while `d2` contains values from a backward pass. The function does not return any value but outputs the results of the queries.**
