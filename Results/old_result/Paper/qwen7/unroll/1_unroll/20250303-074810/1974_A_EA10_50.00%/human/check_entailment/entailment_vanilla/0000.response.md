### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and then iterates over each test case using a loop. This part is correct.

2. **Variables Initialization**: Inside the loop, the program initializes variables `x` and `y` which store the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively. This is done correctly using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons**: 
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`, which represents the minimum number of screens required just for the 2x2 icons. This calculation is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to account for the fact that each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

4. **Adjustment for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons. If this remaining space is less than the number of 1x1 icons (`x`), additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - The condition `if m < a:` checks if there is not enough space on the current screens to place the remaining 1x1 icons. If true, it adds the necessary number of additional screens using the formula `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This ensures that the division is integer-based, rounding up to the nearest whole number.

5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `z`, which is the total number of screens required. This is correct as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and correctly computes the minimum number of screens needed.

### Correctness:
**True**
