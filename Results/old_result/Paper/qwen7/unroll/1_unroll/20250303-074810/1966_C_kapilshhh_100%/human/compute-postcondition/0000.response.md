Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and all other variables are undefined.**

Explanation: The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. The initial values of `t` and the list of integers are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The list of integers and the value of `n` remain undefined until further input is provided.
