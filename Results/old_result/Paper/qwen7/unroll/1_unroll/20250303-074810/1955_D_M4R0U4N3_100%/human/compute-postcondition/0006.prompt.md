You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. b is a list of m integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    max_val = 1000000
    cnt_b = [0] * (max_val + 1)
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(m):
            cnt_b[b[i]] += 1

        curr = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
        
        if curr >= k:
            ans += 1
        
        for i in range(n - m):
            if a[i] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        for i in b_values:
            cnt_b[i] = 0
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop processes multiple test cases, and for each test case, it updates the `cnt_b` list based on certain conditions but resets `cnt_b` to all zeros at the end of each test case. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the `cnt_b` list remains a list of 1000001 zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5), m (an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5, and k (an integer between 1 and 10^4). Additionally, it accepts two lists: a (a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^6) and b (a list of m integers, each between 1 and 10^6). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
