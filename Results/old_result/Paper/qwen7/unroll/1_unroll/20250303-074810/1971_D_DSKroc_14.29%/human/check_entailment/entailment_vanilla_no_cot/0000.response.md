Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it counts the number of positions where the current character is greater than the next character, which does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of cuts required to sort the binary string.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

- Input: `1010`
- Expected Output: `2` (The string can be split into "10" and "10", and then rearranged to "0011".)
- Program Output: `1` (The program would incorrectly count the position where '1' is followed by '0', leading to only one cut.)

To solve this problem correctly, we should identify the points where the sequence changes from '0' to '1'. Each such change indicates a potential cut point. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        last_char = '0'
        for char in s:
            if char == '1' and last_char == '0':
                count += 1
            last_char = char
        # If the string ends with '0', we need an additional piece
        if last_char == '0':
            count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This program correctly identifies the number of cuts needed by counting the transitions from '0' to '1'.
