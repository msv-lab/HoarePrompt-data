Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). It checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) distinct characters from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. If any test case meets this criterion, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it determines which character from the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets is missing and prints a string consisting of the characters in the list \( ans \) followed by the missing character and the remaining characters needed to satisfy the count \( n \). If none of the test cases meet the criterion, the function prints 'NO'.**
