Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
