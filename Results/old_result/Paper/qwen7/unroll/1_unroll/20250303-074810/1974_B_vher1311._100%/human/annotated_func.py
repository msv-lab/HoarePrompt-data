#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #A string formed by mapping each character in 'encoded' to its mirrored counterpart in the 'mapping' dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its mirrored counterpart based on a predefined mapping.
