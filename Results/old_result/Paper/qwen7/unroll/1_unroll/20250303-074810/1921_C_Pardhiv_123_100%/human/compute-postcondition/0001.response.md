The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive). Since the value of `t` is within this range, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary because the condition `t > 0` is already satisfied given the constraints.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive)**
