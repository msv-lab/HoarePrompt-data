Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `x` is the k-th element of list `a`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the k-th element of the list `a` to the variable `x`. Since `a` is a list of n distinct integers and `k` is an integer within the range [1, n], `x` will be the specific integer located at index `k-1` in the list `a` (since list indices start at 0). All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
