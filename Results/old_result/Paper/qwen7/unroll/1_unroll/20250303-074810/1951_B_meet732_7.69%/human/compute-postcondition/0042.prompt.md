You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a value which is `n` minus 1, but the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state.

Case_2: The program returns k-1, where k is the index stored in ind[0]

Case_3: The program returns a value that is `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index from the list `a` where an element is greater than the 14th element of `a`, and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.

Case_4: The program returns the maximum value between k - ind[0] and ind[0] - 1, where ind[0] is the index of the element in list a that is greater than the 14th element of a, and k is a given value.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1, given that `ind` contains indices of elements in `a` greater than the 14th element of `a`, and `ind`'s first element is 0.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between the first index in `ind` minus 1 and the difference between the second index in `ind` and the first index in `ind`.

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
