The function processes a list `a` of distinct integers and an integer `k`. It identifies indices of elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element of `a`. Based on the number of such indices found and their positions relative to `k`, the function returns one of several possible values. Specifically, it can return `n-1`, `k-1`, `ind[0]-1`, the maximum of `k-ind[0]` and `ind[0]-1`, the minimum of `ind[1]-1` and `k-1`, the maximum of `ind[0]-1` and `ind[1]-ind[0]`, or the maximum of `ind[0]-1` and `k-ind[0]`. The returned value depends on the conditions met during the execution of the function.
