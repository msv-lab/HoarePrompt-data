You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    YES

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [0]
        c = [0]
        (i, j) = (0, 0)
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of queries on a given list `c`. It reads the list `c` and a number of queries from standard input. For each query defined by a pair of indices `(a, b)`, it calculates the count of the integer `1` within the subarray `c[a-1...b]` and compares it to half the length of the subarray. If the count of `1`s is greater than half the length of the subarray, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine whether a subarray is good according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks if the sum of the subarray minus the count of 1s in the subarray is greater than or equal to the length of the subarray minus one. However, this condition is not sufficient to ensure that the subarray is good.

To illustrate, consider the following subarray: `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]` from indices `1` to `3`. The subarray is `[2, 1, 4]`.

- Sum of the subarray: \(2 + 1 + 4 = 7\)
- Count of 1s in the subarray: \(1\)
- Length of the subarray: \(3\)

According to the program's logic:
\[ 7 - 1 \geq 3 - 1 \]
\[ 6 \geq 2 \]

This condition is satisfied, so the program would incorrectly print 'YES'. However, this subarray is not good because it is impossible to create another array `b` that satisfies all the conditions (specifically, the second and third conditions).

A correct approach would involve checking if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are distinct and positive. This requires a more complex algorithm, such as checking the uniqueness of elements and ensuring the sum condition is met.
