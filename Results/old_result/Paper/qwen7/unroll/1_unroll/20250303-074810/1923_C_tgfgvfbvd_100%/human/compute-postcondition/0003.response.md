Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of n positive integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, along with m queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` indicating a range within the list. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the specified range [l_i, r_i].**

This means the function is designed to take a list of numbers and a series of range queries, and for each query, it calculates and returns the sum of the elements within the given range in the list.
