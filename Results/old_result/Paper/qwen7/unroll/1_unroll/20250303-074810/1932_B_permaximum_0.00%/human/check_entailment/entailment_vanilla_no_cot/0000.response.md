Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur based on the given periodicities. Here's a brief explanation of why the program works:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
3. **Calculate Year**: It initializes `year` to 0. For each periodicity \( a_i \), it updates `year` to the next multiple of \( a_i \) that hasn't been covered yet. This is done using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`, which effectively skips over multiples of \( a_i \) that have already been covered.
4. **Output Result**: After processing all periodicities, it prints the final value of `year`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the year when all signs will occur sequentially, matching the requirements of the problem statement.
