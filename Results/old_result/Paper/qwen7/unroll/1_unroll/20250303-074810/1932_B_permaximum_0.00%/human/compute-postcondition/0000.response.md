Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the output state reflects that `t` is now an integer input within this range. The other conditions and lists remain unaffected.
