Output State: `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains its corresponding index's adjacent indices after processing all the input pairs (u, v). Each pair (u, v) adds both u and v to each other's list, making `u2vs` represent an undirected graph's adjacency lists.
