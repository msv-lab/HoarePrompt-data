For the given `while True` loop, the loop will always execute at least once because it is an infinite loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is updated to contain the shortest distances from node 0 to all nodes using BFS, `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path for each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`**
