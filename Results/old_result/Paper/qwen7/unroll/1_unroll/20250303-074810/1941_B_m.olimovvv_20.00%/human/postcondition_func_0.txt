The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` and a list `b`. It checks if the first element of `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the specified conditions.
