Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements of the array with specific conditions (`b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2` and `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`). This approach is too simplistic and does not cover all scenarios where the array can or cannot be made zero.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the sum of all elements in the array is divisible by 3, and each element's contribution to the total sum must allow for the described operations to reduce the entire array to zeros. The solution should check these conditions properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3
        if sum(b) % 3 != 0:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if each prefix sum up to any point is divisible by 3
        prefix_sum = 0
        for num in b:
            prefix_sum += num
            if prefix_sum % 3 != 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version checks whether the sum of the array and each prefix sum is divisible by 3, which is necessary and sufficient for making all elements zero using the given operations.
