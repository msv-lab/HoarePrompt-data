### Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking the conditions to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, there are logical flaws in the conditions used to decide whether "Yes" or "No" should be printed.

1. **Condition `if n == m:`**: This condition is correct; if the number of moves `n` equals the desired number of cubes `m`, it is possible to achieve this by adding 1 cube per move.

2. **Condition `elif m > n:`**: This condition is incorrect. If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have more cubes than the total number of moves, because each move can only add or remove exactly 1 cube.

3. **Condition `elif m == n - 1:`**: This condition is also incorrect. While it is true that removing 1 cube from a tower of `n` cubes leaves you with `n-1` cubes, this does not cover all scenarios where `m` could be achieved. For example, if `n` is even and `m` is odd, or vice versa, it might still be possible to achieve `m` cubes depending on the sequence of moves.

4. **Conditions involving even and odd numbers**: The conditions `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are overly restrictive. They do not account for the possibility of achieving an odd number of cubes from an even number of moves or vice versa.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine if it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and thus the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes will change with each move. Therefore, the difference between `n` and `m` must be even for it to be possible.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program contains logical errors in its conditions, leading to incorrect outputs in certain scenarios. The corrected approach checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which accurately determines the possibility of achieving `m` cubes after `n` moves.

**Correctness: False**
