Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to account for the scenario where the vertices chosen by Bessie are consecutive. In such cases, the program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 2
1 3
```
Here, Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3, and you can choose up to 2 more vertices. The correct solution should maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of triangles.

The program logic does not properly handle the gap between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices that can be added. It fails to consider the possibility of forming additional triangles by adding vertices in such a way that they fill the gaps between the existing vertices.

To fix this, the program needs to properly calculate the gaps between the chosen vertices and ensure that the additional vertices are placed optimally to maximize the number of triangles.
