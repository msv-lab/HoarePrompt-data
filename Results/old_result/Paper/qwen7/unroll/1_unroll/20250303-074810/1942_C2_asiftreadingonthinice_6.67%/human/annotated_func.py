#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2

    #State: tt is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each ii in range(tt), there are variables n, x, y, and a (a list of integers). After processing each list a, ans is calculated and printed as min(ans, n - 2). The final state of tt, n, x, y, and a for each iteration are not specified, but ans is determined based on the given logic.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions involving these integers and the sorted list of chosen vertices. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case.
