You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of `x` chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `ans` is initialized to `x + y - 2`. This is because the minimum number of triangles that can be formed using `x` chosen vertices is `x - 2` plus the additional `y` vertices.
   - `tmp` is an empty list used to store additional triangles formed by the logic below.

3. **Processing Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices `a`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list to check pairs of consecutive chosen vertices.
     - If the difference between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it means a triangle can be formed without needing any additional vertices, so `ans` is incremented by 1.
     - If the difference is even and greater than 2, it calculates how many additional triangles can be formed by splitting the segment into smaller segments of length 2, and updates `ans` and `y` accordingly.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - After processing the internal segments, it checks the edge case where the first and last chosen vertices form a potential triangle with the full circle.
     - Similar to the internal segment logic, it checks if the difference between the first and last chosen vertices (considering the wrap-around) can form additional triangles.

5. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The remaining value of `y` is added to `ans` as these are the remaining vertices that can be used to form additional triangles.
   - The final result is capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Correctness Check

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

- The program handles the basic case of forming triangles directly from the chosen vertices.
- It correctly identifies and counts additional triangles formed by splitting segments of even lengths.
- It properly handles the edge case involving the first and last chosen vertices.
- The final adjustment ensures the result is within the valid range.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it seems to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
