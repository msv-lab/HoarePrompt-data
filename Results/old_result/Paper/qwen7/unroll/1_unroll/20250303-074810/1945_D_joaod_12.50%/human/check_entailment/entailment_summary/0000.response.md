Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. It correctly initializes variables and adjusts indices to match the problem's requirements.
3. The main loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, calculating the minimum cost to reach or pass `pos_final`.
4. The logic inside the loop correctly handles both scenarios where Kirill can either swap positions with someone in front of him or pass through them, choosing the cheaper option.
5. The program updates the `best` variable to keep track of the minimum cost found during the iteration.
6. The output is printed for each test case, which matches the problem's requirement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
