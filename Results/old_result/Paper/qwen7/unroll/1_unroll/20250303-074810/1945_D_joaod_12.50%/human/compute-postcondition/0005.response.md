Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers n and m, and two lists of positive integers a and b. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost required to move from index `na_frente` to index `pos_final` using either direct swapping or passing through elements, based on their respective costs. The function outputs the minimum cost for each test case.**
