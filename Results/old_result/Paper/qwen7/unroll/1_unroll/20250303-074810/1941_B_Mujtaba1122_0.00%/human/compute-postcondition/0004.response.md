Based on the initial state described, the precondition specifies that the list transformation occurs according to certain conditions, but the actual values of the list elements are not provided. The key point is that after the transformation, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`. This implies that the list has been modified in such a way that the specified condition for any index `i` (where 1 < i < n-1) is no longer satisfied.

Given this, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
