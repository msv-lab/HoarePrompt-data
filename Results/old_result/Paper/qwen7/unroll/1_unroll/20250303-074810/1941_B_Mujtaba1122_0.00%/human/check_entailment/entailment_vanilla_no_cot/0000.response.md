Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem statement. The operations should reduce `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts based on the value of `a_i`, but the current implementation incorrectly reduces these values. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the array cannot be made entirely zero, which is evident from the examples provided in the problem statement. The function should check if it's possible to make all elements zero through the specified operations and print 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
