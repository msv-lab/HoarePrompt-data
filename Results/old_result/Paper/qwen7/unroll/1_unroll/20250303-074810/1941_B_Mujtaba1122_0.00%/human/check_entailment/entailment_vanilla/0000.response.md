Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - After performing the operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If they are, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Effectiveness**:
   - The operation reduces three elements: `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}`.
   - Specifically, it decreases `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1.
   - This operation is designed to reduce the value of `a_i` by 2, which is crucial for making the array elements zero.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible.
   - It ensures that the operation can only be applied when the necessary conditions are met (`a_i > 1` and both neighbors are greater than 0).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if all elements are zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm handles edge cases where the array might not allow further operations (e.g., if no valid `i` exists).
   - It correctly identifies such cases and prints 'NO'.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this goal.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
