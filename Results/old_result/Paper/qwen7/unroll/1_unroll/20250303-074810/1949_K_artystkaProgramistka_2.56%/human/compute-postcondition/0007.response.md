Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a which contains all the numbers from the original numbers list, group_b which is an empty list, and group_c which is also an empty list.**

This means the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluated to True, and the program returns a tuple containing the string 'YES', the list `group_a` (which includes all numbers from the original `numbers` list), an empty list `group_b`, and an empty list `group_c`.
