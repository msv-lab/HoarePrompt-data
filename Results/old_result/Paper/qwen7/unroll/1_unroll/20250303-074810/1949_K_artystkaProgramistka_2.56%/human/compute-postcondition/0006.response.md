Postcondition: **`numbers` is a list of n sorted positive integers in descending order; `group_a` is a list containing all the numbers from the original `numbers` list; `group_b` is an empty list; `group_c` is an empty list; `sum_a` is the sum of all the numbers in the original `numbers` list; `sum_b` is 0; `sum_c` is 0. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**
