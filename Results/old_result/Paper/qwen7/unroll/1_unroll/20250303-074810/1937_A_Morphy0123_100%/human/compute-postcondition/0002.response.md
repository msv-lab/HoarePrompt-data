Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is the number of test cases processed, each `n` is an integer that was input for each case, and for each `n`, if `n` is 1, the output is 1; otherwise, the output is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `2^power` where `power` is the smallest integer such that `2^power` is greater than or equal to `n`.
