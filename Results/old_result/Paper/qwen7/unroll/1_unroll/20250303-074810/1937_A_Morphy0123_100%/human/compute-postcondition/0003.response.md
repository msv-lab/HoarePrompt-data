Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each `i` from `0` to `n_cases-1`, the output consists of either `1`, `2 ** power` where `power` is an integer, or no output if the input `n` was not `1`. Each `n` is processed independently based on its value, and the results are printed during the execution of the loop.
