You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n`. It calculates and prints the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n`, unless `n` is 1, in which case it simply prints 1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We start with an array \(a\) where \(a_i = i\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- For each \(i = 2, 3, \ldots, n\), we perform the operation `swap(k)` where \(k\) is the current value of \(i\).
- The `swap(k)` operation swaps \(a_d\) and \(a_k\) where \(d\) is the largest divisor of \(k\) that is not equal to \(k\) itself.
- We need to find the position of the number 1 in the array after performing all these operations.

### Provided Program Analysis:
```python
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Handling Single Element Array:**
   - If \(n = 1\), it correctly prints 1 because the array is just `[1]` and no swaps are needed.

3. **General Case for \(n > 1\):**
   - The program calculates \(n\) using `log2(n)`, but this calculation is unnecessary and incorrect for determining the position of 1 in the array.
   - It then iterates over a loop to increment `power` until it exceeds `n`.
   - This loop is used to determine some value related to powers of 2, but it does not correctly implement the `swap` operation as described in the problem statement.

4. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic inside the loop and the final print statements do not correctly simulate the swapping process described in the problem.
   - The program does not actually perform any swaps on the array, nor does it track the positions of the elements as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the `swap` operation as described in the problem statement. It does not simulate the swapping of elements based on their divisors, and instead, it performs an unrelated calculation involving logarithms and powers of 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
