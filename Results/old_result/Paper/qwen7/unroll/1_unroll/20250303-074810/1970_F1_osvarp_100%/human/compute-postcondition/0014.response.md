Functionality: **The function reads input data representing a game grid and player movements, updates the game state based on these inputs, and prints the final scores. It does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. The function processes up to `t` commands, updating the positions of players and checking for eliminations or goals. If a golden snitch is caught, it increments the score for the corresponding team. If a player reaches a goal, it also increments the score and prints the result. After processing all commands, it prints the final scores of both teams.**
