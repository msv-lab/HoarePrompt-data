Functionality: The function `goalIn` accepts a position `pos` (a string) and a list of goals `goal` (containing two sets of positions). It checks if `pos` is in the first set of `goal` (representing the red team's goals) and returns 0 if true. If `pos` is in the second set of `goal` (representing the blue team's goals), it returns 1. If `pos` is not in either set, it returns -1.
