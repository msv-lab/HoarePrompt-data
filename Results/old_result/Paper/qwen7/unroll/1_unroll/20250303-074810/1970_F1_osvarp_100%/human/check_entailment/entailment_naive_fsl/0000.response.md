Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, causing the opposing team to score a point. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the `func_1` function does not account for this case. Specifically, the function checks if the Quaffle is thrown into a goal using the `goalIn` function, but it does not update the points or print the appropriate message when this happens.

Here is an example that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 0
```

In this example, the red player throws the Quaffle into the blue goal, but the program does not update the score or print the correct message. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
