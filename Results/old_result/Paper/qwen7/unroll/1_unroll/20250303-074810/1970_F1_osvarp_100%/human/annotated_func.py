    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is an empty dictionary, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, but since `t` is initially set to 0, the loop does not execute at all. Therefore, no changes are made to any of the variables inside the loop. The `allPlayers` dictionary remains empty, the `grid` remains an empty list, and the `points` list remains [0, 0].
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: 0 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data representing a game grid and player movements, updates the game state based on these inputs, and prints the final scores. It does not accept any parameters and does not return anything. The function processes up to `t` commands, updating the positions of players and checking for eliminations or goals. If a golden snitch is caught, it increments the score for the corresponding team. If a player reaches a goal, it also increments the score and prints the result. After processing all commands, it prints the final scores of both teams.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a string representing a position on the field, where the position is either "RG" or "BG". goal is a list of two sets, where each set contains the positions of the goals for the red and blue teams respectively.
def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns the value of `res`, which is 0 if `pos` is in `goal[0]`, 1 if `pos` is in `goal[1]`, and -1 otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `goalIn` accepts a position `pos` (a string) and a list of goals `goal` (containing two sets of positions). It checks if `pos` is in the first set of `goal` (representing the red team's goals) and returns 0 if true. If `pos` is in the second set of `goal` (representing the blue team's goals), it returns 1. If `pos` is not in either set, it returns -1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string representing an entity on the field, where the first character is the team (R for Red, B for Blue) and the second character is either a player number (0-9) or G for a goal.
def isPlayer(el):
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value 'res' which is True if 'el[0]' is either 'B' or 'R' and 'el[1]' is not 'G', otherwise False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `isPlayer` accepts a string `el` representing an entity on the field and returns `True` if the first character of `el` is either 'R' or 'B' and the second character is not 'G'. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
