You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of the list with the \( k \)-th element, calculates two values \( ans \) and \( ans1 \) based on certain conditions involving these elements, and finally prints the maximum of these two values. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (number of cows) and `k` (the index of the cow).
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows into a list `s`.

2. **Swapping Positions:**
   - The program swaps the positions of the first cow (`s[0]`) and the cow at position `k-1` (the cow with index `k`).
   - This is done to consider the scenario where the cow at position `k` is moved to the first position.

3. **Counting Wins:**
   - It initializes `ans` to count the number of wins starting from the first position.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of the cow at the first position and `j` to -1.
   - It iterates through the list starting from the second position:
     - If the current cow's rating is greater than `h`, the loop breaks, indicating the cow at the first position loses.
     - Otherwise, it increments the win count `ans`.

4. **Restoring Original Position:**
   - It restores the original positions of the first cow and the cow at position `k-1`.

5. **Considering Other Possible Swaps:**
   - It identifies the position `p` where the cow at the first position (`h`) would lose to the next cow.
   - It swaps the cow at position `p` with the cow at position `k-1`.
   - It initializes `z` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list again:
     - If the cow at position `p` is equal to `h` and the cow at the first position is not `h`, it counts this as a win.
     - If the cow at position `p` is greater than `h`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, it increments the win count `ans1`.

6. **Outputting Result:**
   - It prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Swapping Logic:**
   - The logic for swapping the cow at position `k-1` with the first cow is correct. This allows us to consider the best possible initial position for the cow.

2. **Win Counting:**
   - The logic for counting wins is correct. It correctly identifies when the cow loses and stops counting further wins.

3. **Handling Different Scenarios:**
   - The program considers two scenarios: moving the cow to the first position and considering the best possible swap position. This ensures we find the maximum number of wins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when the cow at position `k` is already in a position where it can win more matches without needing a swap.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow. It considers both scenarios (swapping to the first position and considering other possible swaps) and outputs the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
