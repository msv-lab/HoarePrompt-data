Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cows \( n \), the index of the cow \( k \), and the ratings of the cows.
3. It swaps the positions of the first cow and the \( k \)-th cow in the list.
4. It then calculates the maximum number of wins the cow at position \( k \) can achieve under two scenarios:
   - When the cow at position 1 is the highest-rated cow among the first \( p \) cows (where \( p \) is the position where the cow at position 1 loses).
   - When the cow at position 1 is not the highest-rated cow among the first \( p \) cows.
5. The program correctly computes and prints the maximum number of wins for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
