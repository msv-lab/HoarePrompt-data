You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers where b is not zero.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns a tuple containing 1 and 0
    #State: a and b are positive integers where b is not zero
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns d and c, where c is the result of func_1(b, a) and d is the second return value of func_1(b, a)
    #State: a and b are positive integers where b is not zero, and a is greater than or equal to b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)
    #State: a and b are positive integers where b is not zero, and a is greater than or equal to b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple where the first element is the second return value from func_1(b, a % b), and the second element is the difference between c minus the floor division of a by b multiplied by the second return value from func_1(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers and `b` is not zero. It returns either a tuple containing 1 and 0, a tuple where the first element is the second return value from `func_1(b, a % b)` and the second element is the difference between `c` minus the floor division of `a` by `b` multiplied by the second return value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, `d` and `c` where `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` and `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, or 1 and the negative of `(a // b - 1)` based on the conditions specified.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a tuple containing 1 and 0

Case_2: The program returns d and c, where c is the result of func_1(b, a) and d is the second return value of func_1(b, a)

Case_3: The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)

Case_4: The program returns a tuple where the first element is the second return value from func_1(b, a % b), and the second element is the difference between c minus the floor division of a by b multiplied by the second return value from func_1(b, a % b)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
