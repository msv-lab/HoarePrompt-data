Precondition: **a is an integer, and b is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (c, d) such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^9 + 6 and d ≠ 0.** 

However, based on the problem description and the context provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding. The function `func_2` does not directly relate to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, it appears to be a helper function that takes an integer `a` and a list of tuples `b`, and returns a modified version of `a` using the values from `b`. The function `func_1` is assumed to take a list and a modulus value and return a tuple of integers.

Given the problem context, the function `func_2` is likely not the main function solving the problem but rather a part of a larger solution or a utility function. The actual function solving the problem would need to process the indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the valid permutations, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.
