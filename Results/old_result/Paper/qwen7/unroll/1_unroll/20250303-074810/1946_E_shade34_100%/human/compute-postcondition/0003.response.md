Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of tuples `b`, where each tuple contains two integers `(c, d)` within the range 1 to 10^9 + 6 (inclusive), and `d` is not zero. It then calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number (1000000007) as arguments. After obtaining the result `(c, d)` from `func_1`, it returns the product of `c` and `a` modulo 1000000007.**
