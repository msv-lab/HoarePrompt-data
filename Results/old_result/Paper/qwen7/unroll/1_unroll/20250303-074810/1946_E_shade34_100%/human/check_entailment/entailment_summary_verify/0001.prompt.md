You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return (1, 0)
    if a < b:
        (c, d) = func_1(b, a)
        return (d, c)
    if a % b == 0:
        return (1, -(a // b - 1))
    (c, d) = func_1(b, a % b)
    return (d, c - a // b * d)

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    (c, d) = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of tuples `b`, where each tuple contains two integers `(c, d)` within the range 1 to 10^9 + 6 (inclusive), and `d` is not zero. It then calls another function `func_1` with `b` and a large prime number (1000000007) as arguments. After obtaining the result `(c, d)` from `func_1`, it returns the product of `c` and `a` modulo 1000000007.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy the given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic.

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). It calculates the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation seems to be incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `gcd(a, b) != 1`.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute `a * b^{-1} \mod 1000000007`, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

3. **Correctness of Functions**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to solve the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)` but only returns a solution when `a` and `b` are coprime (`gcd(a, b) == 1`). For other cases, it may return incorrect results or fail to terminate.
   - `func_2` relies on `func_1` to find the modular inverse. If `func_1` fails, `func_2` will also fail.

4. **Usage in the Problem**:
   - The problem requires combinatorial counting, specifically calculating binomial coefficients and factorials under modulo `1000000007`. These calculations typically involve modular inverses and modular arithmetic operations.
   - The functions provided do not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem. Instead, the problem would require more specific combinatorial logic and potentially dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion principles.

### Conclusion

Given that the provided functions do not appear to be used correctly or appropriately for the problem, and considering the complexity of the problem (involving combinatorial counting), the given code does not seem to be a correct solution to the problem.
