Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers and `b` is not zero. It returns either a tuple containing 1 and 0, a tuple where the first element is the second return value from `func_1(b, a % b)` and the second element is the difference between `c` minus the floor division of `a` by `b` multiplied by the second return value from `func_1(b, a % b)`, `d` and `c` where `c` is the result of `func_1(b, a)` and `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, or 1 and the negative of `(a // b - 1)` based on the conditions specified.**
