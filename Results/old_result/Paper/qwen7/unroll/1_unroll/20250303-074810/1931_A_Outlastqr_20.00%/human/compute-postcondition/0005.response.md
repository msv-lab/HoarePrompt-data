Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) and generates a corresponding string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, it appends 'zz' to a character derived from the alphabet; if `n` is greater than 26, it appends 'z' to two characters derived from the alphabet; otherwise, it appends three characters derived from the alphabet. The function prints these strings for each input `n` and does not return any value.**
