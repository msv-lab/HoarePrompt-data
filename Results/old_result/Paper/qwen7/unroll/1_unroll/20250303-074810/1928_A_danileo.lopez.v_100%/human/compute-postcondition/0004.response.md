Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

However, since the exact logic for processing `a`, `b`, and `t` is not specified in the given information, the functionality cannot be fully described without additional details.
