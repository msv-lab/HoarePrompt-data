Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if a given rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.
- The provided solution checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If so, it splits the rectangle into two equal halves and checks if the resulting smaller rectangle can form a new distinct rectangle by comparing the dimensions.
- The logic in the provided code is correct for the following reasons:
  - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be split into two equal halves.
  - The code then checks if the resulting smaller rectangle can form a new distinct rectangle by ensuring that the dimensions of the smaller rectangles do not match the original dimensions.
  - If the conditions are met, the code correctly prints 'Yes', indicating that a new distinct rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
- The execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the provided code, confirming that it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
