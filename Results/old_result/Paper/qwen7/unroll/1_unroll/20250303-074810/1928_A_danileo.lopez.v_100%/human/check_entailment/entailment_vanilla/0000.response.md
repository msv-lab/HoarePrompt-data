Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Checking Even Sides:**
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
     - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`), both equal to `a // 2`.
     - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal halves (`b1` and `b2`), both equal to `b // 2`.

3. **Condition for "Yes":**
   - If `a` is even and `a1` (which is `a // 2`) is not equal to `b`, it prints "Yes".
   - Similarly, if `b` is even and `b1` (which is `b // 2`) is not equal to `a`, it prints "Yes".
   - In both cases, if the condition is met, it prints "Yes" and continues to the next test case.

4. **Condition for "No":**
   - If neither `a` nor `b` is even, it prints "No".

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Case 1: Both `a` and `b` are odd.**
  - The program correctly identifies this case and prints "No" because no matter how you split an odd number, you cannot form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

- **Case 2: One of `a` or `b` is even.**
  - If `a` is even, splitting it into two equal halves and checking if the halves do not match `b` is correct.
  - If `b` is even, splitting it into two equal halves and checking if the halves do not match `a` is correct.
  - However, the current implementation only checks if `a1` or `b1` does not match the other dimension. This is not sufficient to ensure a new rectangle can be formed.

### Example Test Cases:

1. **Test Case: (1, 1)**
   - Both dimensions are odd, so the program correctly prints "No".

2. **Test Case: (2, 1)**
   - `a` is even, but `a1` (1) matches `b`, so the program incorrectly prints "No".

3. **Test Case: (2, 6)**
   - `a` is even, `a1` (1) does not match `b` (6), so the program correctly prints "Yes".

4. **Test Case: (3, 2)**
   - `b` is even, `b1` (1) does not match `a` (3), so the program correctly prints "Yes".

5. **Test Case: (2, 2)**
   - Both dimensions are even, but splitting them results in `a1` (1) matching `b` (2), so the program incorrectly prints "No".

6. **Test Case: (2, 4)**
   - `a` is even, `a1` (1) does not match `b` (4), so the program correctly prints "Yes".

7. **Test Case: (6, 3)**
   - `a` is even, `a1` (3) matches `b` (3), so the program incorrectly prints "No".

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where one dimension is even and the other is odd, and the halves do not form a new rectangle. The logic needs to be more comprehensive to ensure all conditions are checked correctly.

**Correctness: **False**
