Output State: **`l` is 0, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices `i` where `s[i] == '>'` from right to left, `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element in `B` and the difference between the current index and the previous index in `idx_B`.**

Explanation: The code simply initializes the variable `l` to 0. The lists `idx_B` and `B` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `l` is now explicitly set to 0.
