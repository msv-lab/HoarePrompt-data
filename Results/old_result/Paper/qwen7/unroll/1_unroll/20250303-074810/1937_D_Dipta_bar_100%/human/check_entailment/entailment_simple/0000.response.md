### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the length of the grid (`n`) and the string `s` representing the grid. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates two lists, `A` and `B`, based on the positions of `>` in the string `s` from left to right and from right to left, respectively.
   - `A` is constructed such that each element represents the time taken for a pinball starting at the corresponding position to reach the right boundary if the direction changes every step.
   - `B` is similarly constructed but for the left boundary.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic iterates through each position in the string `s` and uses the precomputed lists `A` and `B` to determine the time taken for a pinball starting at that position to leave the grid.
   - The logic correctly handles the transitions between left and right boundaries and updates the time calculations based on the current position and the precomputed values.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary or where the grid is entirely composed of one direction (either all `>` or all `<`).

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the correct time for each starting position as required by the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the handling of edge cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
