Output State: **`s` is the sum of the elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive; `ops` is a list that now contains one more element which is the sum `s`; `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values; `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the position of the maximum value (`mx`) within the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and adds `l` to it to get the global index `pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.
