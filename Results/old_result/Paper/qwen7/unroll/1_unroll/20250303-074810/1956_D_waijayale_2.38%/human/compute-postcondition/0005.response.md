Output State: **The numbers `l+1` and `r+1` printed for each operation in `ops`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over each pair `(l, r)` in the list `ops` and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1`. Since no other operations are performed on the variables `a`, `s`, `m`, or `ops` within the loop, their states remain unchanged. The output state will consist of the printed lines showing `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each operation in `ops`.
