Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^7, `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the return values of `func_2(a)`**.

The function `func_2(a)` is called with the list `a` as its argument, and it returns three values: `s`, `m`, and `ops`. These values are assigned to the variables `s`, `m`, and `ops`, respectively. Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `s`, `m`, and `ops`. However, we know that `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function call and are now stored in these variables. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
