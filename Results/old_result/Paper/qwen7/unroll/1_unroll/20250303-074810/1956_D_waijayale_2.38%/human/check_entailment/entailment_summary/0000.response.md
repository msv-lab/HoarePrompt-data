Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_3`**:
   - Reads the input size `n` and the array `a`.
   - Calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum `s`, the number of operations `m`, and the list of operations `ops`.
   - Prints the maximum sum `s` and the number of operations `m`.
   - Iterates through the list of operations `ops` and prints the start and end indices of each operation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - Processes a range `[l, r]` of the array.
   - If the sum of the range is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)\), it sets all elements in the range to \(r - l + 1\) and records the operation.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the range and recursively processes the left and right subranges excluding the position of the maximum value.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Recursively processes a range `[l, r]` of the array.
   - If the range consists of a single element, it checks if the element is non-zero and sets it to zero if necessary.
   - Otherwise, it processes the next element and, if necessary, sets all elements in the range to the expected value and records the operation.

Given the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The recursive approach ensures that the operations are applied optimally to achieve the highest possible sum. The functions handle the array processing and operation recording as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
