### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to several issues in the functions, particularly in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`. Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the provided problem description, function summaries, and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_3` reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.
   - `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.
   - `recursive_maximize_sum` attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`.

3. **Analysis of Functions**:
   - **func_1**: The function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the MEX of that subarray. However, the implementation is incomplete and does not correctly compute the MEX and update the array.
   - **recursive_maximize_sum**: The logic to find the MEX and update the array is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that setting all elements to the maximum value in the subarray will maximize the sum, which is not always true. Additionally, the function does not correctly compute the MEX.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to ensure that the MEX is correctly computed and applied to the subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of numbers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - The function should iteratively apply operations to subarrays to ensure the MEX is correctly set and the sum is maximized.

5. **Verification**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the current implementation of `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` is flawed.
   - The logic to find the MEX and update the array needs to be corrected.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because the functions do not correctly compute the MEX and update the array to maximize the sum.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
