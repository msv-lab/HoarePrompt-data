Output State: **`ops` now contains one more element which is the sum `s`; `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values; `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. `pos` is not equal to `l`; the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` calls the function `recursive_maximize_sum` with arguments `l` and `pos - 1`. This does not change the values of the variables `s`, `ops`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `mx`, or `pos` directly. It only indicates that the function has been called with these parameters. The condition that `pos` is not equal to `l` remains unchanged.
