Postcondition: `ops` is a list that now contains one more element which is the sum `s`. `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values. If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then each element from index `l` to index `r` in `a` is set to `r - l + 1`, and the other elements of `a` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.
