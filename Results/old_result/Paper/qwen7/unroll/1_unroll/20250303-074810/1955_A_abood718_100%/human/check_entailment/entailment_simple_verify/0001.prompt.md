You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of one iteration of the loop based on the given conditions. For each test case, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it calculates \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) (integer division) and prints \(X \times C + B\). The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer \(t\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price**:
   - The program checks if the regular price of two yogurts (`b * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`c`).
     - If `b * 2 < c`, it means it's cheaper to buy yogurts at the regular price. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `b * 2 >= c`, it means it's cheaper to take advantage of the promotion. The program then checks if `A` (the number of yogurts) is even.
       - If `A` is even, it directly calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd by splitting it into the maximum number of pairs that can be bought at the promotion price and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
   - This approach ensures that the total cost is minimized.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1**: 
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is greater than `C = 9`), so it's cheaper to buy at the promotion price.
  - Since `A = 2` is even, the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is greater than `C = 9`), so it's cheaper to buy at the promotion price.
  - Since `A = 3` is odd, the cost is `int(1 * 9 / 1) + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Output: `14` (Correct).

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is less than `C = 11`), so it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
  - Since `A = 3` is odd, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct).

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is less than `C = 11`), so it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
  - Since `A = 4` is even, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
  - Output: `20` (Correct).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular and promotion prices. It handles all edge cases appropriately.
