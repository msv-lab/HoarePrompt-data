Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Price Calculation**:
   - If the price of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`B * 2`), it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the promotion price. Hence, the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If the price of two yogurts (`C`) is greater than or equal to twice the price of one yogurt (`B * 2`), it is better to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining individual yogurts at the regular price.
     - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is even, Maxim can buy all pairs at the promotion price, so the total cost is `int(A * C / 2)`.
     - If the number of yogurts (`A`) is odd, Maxim can buy as many pairs as possible and one additional yogurt at the regular price. The number of pairs is `A // 2`, and the cost is `X * C + B`, where `X` is the number of pairs.

The program handles all the given examples correctly:
- For `2 5 9`: Buying two yogurts for 9 burles is cheaper than buying each for 5 burles, so the total cost is 9.
- For `3 5 9`: It is cheaper to buy two yogurts for 9 burles and one for 5 burles, resulting in a total cost of 14.
- For `3 5 11`: It is cheaper to buy one yogurt for 5 burles and two for 11 burles, resulting in a total cost of 15.
- For `4 5 11`: Maxim can buy all four yogurts at the regular price, resulting in a total cost of 20.

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description and examples provided.
