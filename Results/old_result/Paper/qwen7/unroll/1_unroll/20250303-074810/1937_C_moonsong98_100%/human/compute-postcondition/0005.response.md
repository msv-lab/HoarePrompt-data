Output State: **`max_index` is 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_index` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `n` or any other variables. Therefore, `max_index` is set to 0, and the initial conditions for `n` remain unchanged.
