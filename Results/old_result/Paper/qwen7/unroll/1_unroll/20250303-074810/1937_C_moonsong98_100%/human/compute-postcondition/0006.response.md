Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(0, n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1 because the range function `range(0, n)` will not generate any values if `n` is less than 1.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to start executing. Since `n` is given as an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and `n` is not equal to 2, we can safely assume that `n` is at least 2 (since it cannot be 2 based on the condition).
   - The initial value of `i` is 0, which is already provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be at least 1 (which is already satisfied given the constraints).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`max_index` is 0, `n` is an input integer within the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4 and `n` is not equal to 2**. 

However, to explicitly state what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we focus on `n`:

State: **`n` must be at least 1**.
