Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program's output is:
```
YES
```

This part seems correct. Now consider another test case:

Input:
```
2 2 3
abb
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
aa
```

However, the program's output is:
```
NO
b
```

The issue lies in how the program constructs the string `ans` when it cannot form a valid sequence of length `n`. The program incorrectly appends a single character (`b` in this case) instead of constructing a valid string of length `n` using the available characters. For instance, if `n` is 2, the program should output `aa` or `bb`, but it outputs just `b`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs a valid string of length `n` when it cannot form one using the available subsequences.
