Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by tracking subsequences but contains several logical errors and does not correctly address the requirements of the problem. Hereâ€™s why it is incorrect:

1. **Tracking Subsequences Incorrectly**: The code tries to track subsequences using bit manipulation (`cur`), but it does not correctly handle the generation and checking of all possible strings of length `n`. It only checks if a specific combination of characters appears in the string `s`, not all possible combinations.

2. **Generating and Checking All Possible Strings**: The problem requires checking all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The current implementation does not generate these strings and check their presence in `s`.

3. **Output Format**: The code prints a string `ans` which is not necessarily the lexicographically smallest string that is missing as a subsequence in `s`. This could lead to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, one approach would involve generating all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and then checking if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not found, we print "NO" followed by that string. Otherwise, we print "YES".

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in sub)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
        all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        found_all = True
        for string in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, string):
                print('NO')
                print(string)
                found_all = False
                break
        
        if found_all:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This solution generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and checks if each string is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not found, it prints "NO" followed by that string. Otherwise, it prints "YES".
