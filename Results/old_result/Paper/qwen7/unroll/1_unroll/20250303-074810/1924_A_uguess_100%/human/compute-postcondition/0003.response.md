Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, k, and m, and a string s. t represents the number of test cases. n and k are positive integers with specific ranges, m is also a positive integer within a certain range, and s is a string of length m using the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function returns results based on the given test cases, ensuring the sum of m and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**
