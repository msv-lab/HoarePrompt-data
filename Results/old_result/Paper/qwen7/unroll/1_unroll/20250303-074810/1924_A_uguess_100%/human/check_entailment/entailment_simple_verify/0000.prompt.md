You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:

            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be reduced to an input integer, `n`, `k`, and `m` will be set to values entered by the user, `s` will contain a string entered by the user, and `ans` will either contain a string that satisfies the conditions or will be constructed based on the last iteration's state if the conditions are not met. If `cnt` (the count of valid substrings) is greater than or equal to `n`, `ans` will contain the constructed string with 'YES' printed. Otherwise, `ans` will contain a specific constructed string with 'NO' printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

However, the program's output is:
```
YES
```

This part seems correct. Now consider another test case:

Input:
```
2 2 3
abb
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
aa
```

However, the program's output is:
```
NO
b
```

The issue lies in how the program constructs the string `ans` when it cannot form a valid sequence of length `n`. The program incorrectly appends a single character (`b` in this case) instead of constructing a valid string of length `n` using the available characters. For instance, if `n` is 2, the program should output `aa` or `bb`, but it outputs just `b`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs a valid string of length `n` when it cannot form one using the available subsequences.
