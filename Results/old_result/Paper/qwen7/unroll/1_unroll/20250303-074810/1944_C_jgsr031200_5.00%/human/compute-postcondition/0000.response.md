Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\); `nums` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `nums = collections.Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `nums` that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, and `nums` now holds the frequency count of each element in `arr`.
