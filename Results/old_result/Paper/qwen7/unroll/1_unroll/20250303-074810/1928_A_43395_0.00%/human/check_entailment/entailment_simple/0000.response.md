Reasoning:

1. **Loop through Test Cases**: The program correctly loops through each test case using `for i in range(int(input()))`.

2. **Input Parsing**: It correctly parses the input for each test case, assigning values to `a` and `b`.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - **Even Dimensions**: The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` checks if both dimensions are even. If true, it prints 'yes', which is correct because an even-sized rectangle can always be divided into smaller even-sized rectangles, allowing the formation of another rectangle.
   - **Difference Condition**: The condition `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect. The tuple `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are not valid conditions. Instead, it should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is zero, which would mean `a` and `b` are equal, and thus no new rectangle can be formed.
   - **Odd Difference Condition**: The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is redundant and incorrect. The condition `(a - b) % 2 != 0` would be more appropriate here, but the logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the cases where a new rectangle can be formed.
   - **Default Case**: The default case `else:` prints 'no', which is incorrect. Based on the problem statement, if none of the above conditions are met, it should still print 'yes' in most cases.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
