Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns different outputs based on the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `a`, and `b`. However, since the specific operations to be performed on `a` and `b` are not detailed, the focus here is on the parameters implied by the constraints and the structure of the function call.
