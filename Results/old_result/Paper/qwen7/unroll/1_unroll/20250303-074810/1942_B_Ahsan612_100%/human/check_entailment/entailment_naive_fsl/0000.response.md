Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the program attempts to compute the MEX value in reverse order, which is incorrect. The MEX value for a prefix of the permutation should be computed forward, not backward.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected output:
A valid permutation \( p \) such as `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]` or any other permutation that satisfies the conditions.

However, the provided program generates an incorrect result. Let's walk through the program's logic:

1. It initializes `mex` to `n`.
2. It iterates backward through the array `ar` and computes `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
3. It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

This approach is flawed because it does not correctly compute the MEX value for the prefix of the permutation. Instead, we need to compute the MEX value forward and ensure that the resulting permutation satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [-1] * n
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if ar[i] >= 0:
                res[i] = ar[i]
                mex = max(mex, ar[i] + 1)
            else:
                while mex in res:
                    mex += 1
                res[i] = mex
                mex += 1
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the MEX value is computed correctly and that the resulting permutation satisfies the given conditions.
