Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar` of length `n`.
3. It initializes a result list `res` of length `n` with `None` values.
4. The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the MEX value for the current position in the permutation.
5. The program then iterates backward through the array `ar`. For each index `i`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.
6. This approach ensures that `res[i]` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `res[0:i+1]`, which aligns with the definition of MEX.
7. Finally, it prints the result list `res` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
