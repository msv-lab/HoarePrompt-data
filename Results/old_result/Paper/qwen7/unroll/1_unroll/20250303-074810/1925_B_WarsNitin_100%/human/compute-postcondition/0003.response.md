Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three variables t, x, and n where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. For each test case defined by t, if x and n are within their specified ranges, the function returns a value based on the relationship between x and n.**

However, since the function definition itself does not explicitly accept these parameters, the description focuses on the implied parameters and their constraints.
