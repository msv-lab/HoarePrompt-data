Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Parsing Data:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, parsing the necessary data (number of messages `n`, initial charge `f`, charge consumption per unit of time `a`, and the consumption when turning off and on `b`).
   - It also correctly parses the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Calculating Charge Usage:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the total charge usage by considering whether turning off and on the phone is beneficial.
   - For each message, it checks if the time difference between consecutive messages is less than the break-even point (`b / a`). If it is, the phone is turned off and on at the start of the interval to save charge.
   - However, the logic here is flawed. The program should consider the total charge used for sending messages directly and the additional charge used for turning the phone off and on.

3. **Summing Up Charge Usage:**
   - The program sums up the charge used for sending messages directly and the charge used for turning the phone off and on.
   - It incorrectly calculates the charge used for turning the phone off and on by assuming it happens for every message, which is not always true.

4. **Comparing Total Charge Usage with Initial Charge:**
   - The program compares the total calculated charge usage with the initial charge `f`.
   - If the total charge usage is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Charge Usage for Turning Off and On:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that turning off and on happens for every message, which is not always the optimal strategy.
   - The logic should consider the most efficient way to use the phone's charge, possibly using dynamic programming or a more sophisticated algorithm to minimize the number of turns off and on.

2. **Logic Flaw in Determining When to Turn Off and On:**
   - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is not sufficient to determine when to turn off and on. The program should consider the cumulative charge usage and the optimal points to turn the phone off and on.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
