Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is 400001, and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The code initializes `N` as an integer value which is calculated as `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1`. This results in `N` being set to `400001`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
