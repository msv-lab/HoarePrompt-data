Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\) and storing these sums in a list `pd`. This approach is efficient because it avoids recalculating the sum of digits for each number in every test case, which would be computationally expensive.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Initialization of `pd`:**
   - The size of `pd` is set to \(N = 2 \times 10^5 + 1\), which is correct.
   - The initial values of `pd` are set to 0, which is also correct.

2. **Precomputation Logic:**
   - The logic inside the nested loops is flawed. The inner loop should calculate the sum of digits for the current number `i` and add it to `pd[i]`, but the current implementation incorrectly accumulates the sum of digits from previous numbers (`pd[i - 1]`) and then adds the sum of digits of `i`.

3. **Sum of Digits Calculation:**
   - The sum of digits of `i` should be calculated correctly using the inner loop, but the current implementation is incorrect.

4. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and printing the precomputed results.

Given these points, the current implementation will not produce the correct results due to the flawed logic for precomputing the sum of digits.

Correctness: **False**
