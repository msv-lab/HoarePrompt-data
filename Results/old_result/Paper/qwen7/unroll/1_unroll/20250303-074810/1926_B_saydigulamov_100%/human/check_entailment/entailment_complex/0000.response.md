Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether a given grid represents a square or a triangle formed by '1's. A square is defined by rows with an equal number of '1's, while a triangle has rows with an increasing number of '1's until the middle row, after which the number of '1's decreases symmetrically.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and the grid itself.
   - It then checks the number of '1's in the first two rows (`b`). 
   - If the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, it prints 'SQUARE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Square Detection**: A square should have the same number of '1's in each row. However, the code only checks the first two rows. This is insufficient because a square can have different numbers of '1's in different rows, as long as those numbers are equal across all rows.
   - **Triangle Detection**: The code incorrectly identifies a triangle by comparing the number of '1's in the first two rows. This is not sufficient to identify a triangle. A triangle would have an increasing number of '1's up to the middle row, and then a decreasing number of '1's symmetrically.

4. **Example Counterexample**:
   - Consider a grid that is a square but has different numbers of '1's in its rows. For example:
     ```
     000
     011
     011
     011
     ```
     The code would incorrectly identify this as a triangle because the first two rows have the same number of '1's.

Based on the above analysis, the given code is incorrect because it fails to properly identify both squares and triangles according to the problem definition.

Correctness: **False**
