Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining whether the '1's in the grid form a square or a triangle.
2. The provided solution does not correctly identify the shapes. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is insufficient to determine the shape.
3. For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same (equal to `k`).
4. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row follows a specific pattern (2*i-1 for the i-th row).
5. The current implementation does not check these patterns properly. It only compares the count of '1's in the first two rows, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the shapes based on the given problem description. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine the shape of the grid.
