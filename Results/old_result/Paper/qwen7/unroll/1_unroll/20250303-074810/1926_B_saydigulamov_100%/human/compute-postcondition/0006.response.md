Functionality: **The function processes a series of grids, each containing exactly one triangle or one square formed by '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's in the first two rows and compares these counts. If the counts are equal, it indicates a square; otherwise, it indicates a triangle. The function outputs 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each grid based on this comparison.**
