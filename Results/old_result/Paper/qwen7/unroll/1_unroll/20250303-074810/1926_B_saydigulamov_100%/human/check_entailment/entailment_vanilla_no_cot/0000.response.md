Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting of '1's**: The program counts the number of '1's in each row but does not check the structure of the shape.
2. **Triangle Identification**: For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should be `2*i - 1` for the i-th row. The program does not check this condition.
3. **Square Identification**: For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same, and they should be symmetrically placed around the center. The program does not check these conditions either.

To fix this, we need to implement logic that checks the specific patterns for both triangles and squares based on their definitions. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != n - abs(i - (n // 2)):
            return False
    return True

def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i - 1:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        if is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
        elif is_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        else:
            print('UNKNOWN')

func()
```

This version correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle by checking the specific patterns required for each shape.
