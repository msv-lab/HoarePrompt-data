Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(a)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `a`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer, and for each test case, \(2 \leq n \leq 10\).

3. **Understand the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `a` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `a`, `a` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value is not relevant for the loop to start.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `a` being a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must be a positive integer**
