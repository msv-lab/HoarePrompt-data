You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))

            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `a`), the code checks if the number of '1's in the first two strings (`b`) are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The final output state will be a series of lines, each containing either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE', corresponding to the number of iterations of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of grids, each containing exactly one triangle or one square formed by '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's in the first two rows and compares these counts. If the counts are equal, it indicates a square; otherwise, it indicates a triangle. The function outputs 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each grid based on this comparison.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself.
3. It then counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
4. Finally, it checks if the first two counts in `k` are equal and prints 'SQUARE' if they are, otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

This logic fails to correctly identify both types of shapes. Here’s why:

- **Square Identification**: A square would have `k` consecutive rows, each containing `k` ones. However, the program only checks the first two counts and assumes they should be equal if it's a square. This is incorrect because a square could have different counts in its rows. For example, consider the following grid:
  ```
  00000
  00000
  01110
  01110
  00000
  ```
  This grid contains a square but the program will incorrectly identify it as a triangle because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are not equal.

- **Triangle Identification**: The program will also fail for triangles. A triangle would have rows with increasing counts of '1's until the middle row and then decreasing counts. The program’s logic does not account for this pattern.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check for both the specific patterns of a square and a triangle. Here is an example of how the program could be corrected:

```python
def is_square(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if grid[i] != grid[n - i - 1]:
            return False
    return True

def is_triangle(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if grid[i] != grid[n - i - 1]:
            return False
    return True

def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for square
        if is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
            continue
        
        # Check for triangle
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
            continue
        
        # If neither, there is an error in the input or the problem constraints are violated
        print('ERROR')

func()
```

This corrected version checks for both squares and triangles by comparing the rows from the start and end of the grid.
