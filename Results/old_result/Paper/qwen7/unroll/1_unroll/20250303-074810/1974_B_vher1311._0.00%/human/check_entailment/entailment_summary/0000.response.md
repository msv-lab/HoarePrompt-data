Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to decode the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to encode a string, not decode it. Specifically, it replaces each character in `s` with the last unique character found, which is the opposite of what is required for decoding.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding process. Instead of replacing characters with their symmetric counterparts from the sorted unique characters, it simply replaces each character with the last unique character found, which is not the intended behavior.

3. **Misunderstanding of Decoding**: The decoding process should map each character in the encoded string `b` to its corresponding symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect for the task of decoding the string.

Correctness: **False**
