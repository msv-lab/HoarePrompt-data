### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is designed to encode, not decode. Let's break down the issues and confirm the correct approach:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is indeed designed to encode a string, not decode it. It extracts unique characters, sorts them, and then replaces each character in the input string with the last unique character found. This is the reverse of the encoding process described in the problem statement.

2. **Correct Decoding Logic**:
   - To decode the string, we need to create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters.
   - We should use the sorted unique characters and their positions to map back to the original characters.

3. **Corrected Program**:
   - The corrected program provided in the assessment is correct. It extracts the unique characters, sorts them, and creates a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters.
   - It then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is incorrect, and the corrected program is the right solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

This indicates that the given program is incorrect.
