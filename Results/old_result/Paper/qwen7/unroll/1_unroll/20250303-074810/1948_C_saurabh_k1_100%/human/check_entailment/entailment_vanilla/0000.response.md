Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`.
   - It then reads the two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program iterates through every other column starting from index 1 (i.e., odd indices).
   - For each odd index `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) is `<` and both `b[i+1]` (arrow in the second row at index `i+1`) and `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) are `<`.
     - If `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) is `<` and both `b[i-1]` (arrow in the second row at index `i-1`) and `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) are `<`.

3. **Output:**
   - If any of these conditions are met, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If none of the conditions are met for any odd index, the program prints 'yes'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic in the program is flawed. The conditions being checked do not accurately reflect the movement rules of the robot.
   - Specifically, the robot moves based on the arrow it lands on after moving left or right. The program incorrectly assumes that the robot can only move down from the first row to the second row under certain conditions, which is not always true.

2. **Movement Rules Not Followed:**
   - The robot can move in any direction (left, right, up, down) based on the arrows, but the program only checks for specific downward movements from the first row to the second row.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving horizontally within the same row or vertically between rows based on the arrows.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the robot needs to move horizontally or when the arrows allow for multiple valid paths to reach the target cell.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the logic and the movement rules not being correctly implemented, the provided program does not solve the problem as intended.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
