You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the input consists of t test cases, each test case includes the dimensions of a 2x n grid with arrows pointing either left (<) or right (>).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases, each test case outputs 'Yes' if no invalid configurations (where two consecutive left-pointing arrows face each other directly) are found in the 2x `n` grid, otherwise outputs 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) and a 2xn grid with arrows pointing either left (<) or right (>). For each test case, it checks if there are any invalid configurations (where two consecutive left-pointing arrows face each other directly) in the grid. If such configurations are found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`.
   - It then reads the two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program iterates through every other column starting from index 1 (i.e., odd indices).
   - For each odd index `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) is `<` and both `b[i+1]` (arrow in the second row at index `i+1`) and `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) are `<`.
     - If `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) is `<` and both `b[i-1]` (arrow in the second row at index `i-1`) and `a[i]` (arrow in the first row at index `i`) are `<`.

3. **Output:**
   - If any of these conditions are met, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If none of the conditions are met for any odd index, the program prints 'yes'.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The logic in the program is flawed. The conditions being checked do not accurately reflect the movement rules of the robot.
   - Specifically, the robot moves based on the arrow it lands on after moving left or right. The program incorrectly assumes that the robot can only move down from the first row to the second row under certain conditions, which is not always true.

2. **Movement Rules Not Followed:**
   - The robot can move in any direction (left, right, up, down) based on the arrows, but the program only checks for specific downward movements from the first row to the second row.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of the robot moving horizontally within the same row or vertically between rows based on the arrows.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases, such as when the robot needs to move horizontally or when the arrows allow for multiple valid paths to reach the target cell.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the logic and the movement rules not being correctly implemented, the provided program does not solve the problem as intended.
