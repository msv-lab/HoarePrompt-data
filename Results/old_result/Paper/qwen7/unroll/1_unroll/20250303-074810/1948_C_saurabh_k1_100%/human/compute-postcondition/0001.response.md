Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any meaningful value within the context of the loop, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Identify the relevant variables for the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of test cases, it directly controls how many times the loop will run.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Given that the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1. This is because if `t` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
