Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, but it is a throwaway variable (an underscore is often used to indicate that the variable is not used). The key variable that controls the loop is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the loop will definitely execute if `t` is positive.

3. **Adjust the state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is greater than 0. The `results` list being empty is not a condition that affects the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
