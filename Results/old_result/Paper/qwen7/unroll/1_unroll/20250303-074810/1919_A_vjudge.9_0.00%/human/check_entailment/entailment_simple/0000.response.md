### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game is played optimally, and the key observation is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.

2. **Game Logic**: 
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, Bob wins.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, Alice wins.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

5. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main function calls `func_2()`, which processes the input and outputs the correct results based on the logic implemented in `func_1`.

6. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the program. For instance, when the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; when it is odd, Alice wins.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
