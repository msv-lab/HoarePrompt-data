### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided function summary and the problem description.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the number of draws based on the given scores.
- It checks if the total points are even and then calculates the number of matches.
- It uses the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` to determine the number of draws.

#### Correctness Check:
1. **Total Points Even**: The program correctly checks if the total points are even. If they are odd, it returns `-1` immediately.
2. **Maximum Matches Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of matches as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.
3. **Number of Draws Calculation**: The formula used to calculate the number of draws is correct. It subtracts the points contributed by the differences in scores to find the remaining points, which must be due to draws.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Case (0, 0, 0)**: No games, so no draws. Correct.
- **Case (0, 1, 1)**: One draw between the second and third players. Correct.
- **Case (1, 1, 2)**: The program calculates 0 draws, but the correct scenario involves 1 draw and 2 wins. This is a flaw in the program.
- **Case (3, 3, 3)**: No draws, as each player has the same score. Correct.
- **Case (3, 4, 5)**: The program calculates 6 draws, which is correct.
- **Case (1, 1, 10)**: The program calculates 2 draws, which is correct.

The program fails to handle the scenario where multiple games between the same pair of players can lead to different distributions of points. However, the provided test cases do not fully cover all edge cases, and the program logic seems to be mostly correct when considering the constraints and the given examples.

Given the analysis, the program is mostly correct but has a flaw in handling certain edge cases. However, since the original assessment did not provide a complete set of test cases to fully validate the program, we should consider the provided test cases and the logical structure of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not entirely correct due to the flaw in handling certain edge cases, as demonstrated by the case `(1, 1, 2)`. While the program works for the provided test cases, it does not handle all potential scenarios correctly.
