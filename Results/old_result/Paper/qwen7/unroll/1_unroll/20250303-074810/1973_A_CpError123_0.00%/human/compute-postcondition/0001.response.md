Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` which is being unpacked from the elements of the `cas_de_test` list.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - **`cas_de_test`**: This is a list of lists, and for the loop to execute, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one element. Each element in `cas_de_test` is a list containing three integers `[p1, p2, p3]`.
   - **`p1`, `p2`, `p3`**: These are the variables being unpacked from the elements of `cas_de_test`. For the loop to start, there must be at least one list in `cas_de_test` that can be unpacked into `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `cas_de_test` must contain at least one valid list `[p1, p2, p3]` where `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should reflect this requirement.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
- `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p1, p2, and p3 such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one such list.
- `resultats` is an empty list.

In summary:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p1, p2, and p3 such that 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30, and `cas_de_test` must have at least one such list, `resultats` is an empty list**.
