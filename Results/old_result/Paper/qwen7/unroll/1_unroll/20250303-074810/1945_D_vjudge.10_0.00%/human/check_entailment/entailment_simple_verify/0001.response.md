### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `custo` (total cost) to 0.
   - It initializes `max_p` (maximum allowable final position) to the value read from the input.
   - It initializes empty lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.

3. **Reading Input Values**:
   - It reads the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue and appends them to the respective lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions.
   - It starts from the last person in the queue (`num_fila - 1`) and moves backward to the `max_p - 1` position.
   - For each position `y`, it checks whether moving to the next position would cost less than staying at the current position. If so, it adds the appropriate cost to `custo`.
   - It handles edge cases where `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.

5. **Output**:
   - After calculating the total cost for each test case, it prints the result.

#### Detailed Evaluation

- **Logic**:
  - The logic in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions. However, there is a critical issue in the cost calculation part.
  - Specifically, the program incorrectly assumes that the cost of moving from position `y` to `y-1` is always `b_values[y]` or `a_values[y-1] + b_values[y]`. This assumption is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of moving directly to a position within the first `max_p` without considering intermediate positions.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.

- **Input Reading**:
  - The program correctly reads the input values and processes them as required.

#### Correct Cost Calculation

To correctly calculate the minimum cost, we need to consider the optimal path for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions. This involves dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to ensure that the minimum cost is found.

Given the complexity, the original program's logic is insufficient. The provided solution does not account for the optimal path and may lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, it appears that the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed and does not correctly handle the problem constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
