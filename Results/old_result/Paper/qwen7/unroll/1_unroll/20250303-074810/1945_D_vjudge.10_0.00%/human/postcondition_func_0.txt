The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and two lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative cost based on certain conditions involving elements of \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, it iterates through the lists and sums up values according to predefined rules. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative cost for each test case.
