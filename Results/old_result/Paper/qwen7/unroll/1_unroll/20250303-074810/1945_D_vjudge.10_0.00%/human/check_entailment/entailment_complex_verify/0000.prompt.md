You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: Output State: `custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost calculated for each test case after executing the loop. Each element in the list represents the final value of `custo` for that specific test case, based on the given inputs `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values`.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The output state will be a list containing the same values as the initial state, because the loop does not modify the `custos` list. The `print(c)` statement simply outputs each element of the `custos` list without changing its contents.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and two lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative cost based on certain conditions involving elements of \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, it iterates through the lists and sums up values according to predefined rules. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative cost for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move through multiple positions to reach his desired position while minimizing the cost. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the cost by iterating from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` and then from `max_p - 1` down to `0`. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost because it does not consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses a simple comparison between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to decide whether to add `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` to the cost. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the cumulative cost of moving through multiple positions optimally.

3. **Missing Optimal Path Calculation**: The program lacks a mechanism to find the optimal path that minimizes the total cost. It only considers the immediate cost without considering the overall cost of moving through multiple positions.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: The minimum cost should be calculated by considering the optimal path. For instance, moving from position 3 to position 2 and then to position 1 might yield a lower cost than the current logic.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
