Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move through multiple positions to reach his desired position while minimizing the cost. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the cost by iterating from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` and then from `max_p - 1` down to `0`. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum cost because it does not consider the cumulative cost of moving through intermediate positions.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program uses a simple comparison between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to decide whether to add `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` to the cost. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the cumulative cost of moving through multiple positions optimally.

3. **Missing Optimal Path Calculation**: The program lacks a mechanism to find the optimal path that minimizes the total cost. It only considers the immediate cost without considering the overall cost of moving through multiple positions.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: The minimum cost should be calculated by considering the optimal path. For instance, moving from position 3 to position 2 and then to position 1 might yield a lower cost than the current logic.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
