Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`) and the maximum allowable final position (`max_p`).
   - It then reads two lines of space-separated integers representing the arrays `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `custo` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` to calculate the cost for moving Kirill to positions within the allowed range.
     - If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`.
   - After calculating the cost for the allowed range, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1 to ensure Kirill is in the desired position.
     - If the cost of moving from `y - 1` to `y` (i.e., `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to moving directly to `y` (i.e., `a_values[y]`), it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop if `y` is 1.
     - Otherwise, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo` and breaks out of the loop if `y` is 1.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the calculated cost to the list `custos` and prints each cost after processing all test cases.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and initializes variables for each test case.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost when moving within the allowed range (`max_p - 1` to `num_fila - 1`) seems correct.
   - The logic for ensuring Kirill is in the desired position (`max_p - 1` to 1) also appears to be correct, as it checks the cost of moving to the next position and adds the appropriate cost.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where Kirill needs to move to the very first position (i.e., `y == 1`) by adding the cost of moving to the first position.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, the logic for calculating the minimum cost seems correct based on the problem statement. The program handles all necessary steps and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
