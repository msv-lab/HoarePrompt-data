Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` updates the `visited` list to have `n` elements, all set to `False`. The other lists (`x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
