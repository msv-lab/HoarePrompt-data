Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `n` should remain as it is since it is already given as an input integer.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 0.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is already provided.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `bipartite`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `ok` are not part of the loop head and their initial states do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer**
