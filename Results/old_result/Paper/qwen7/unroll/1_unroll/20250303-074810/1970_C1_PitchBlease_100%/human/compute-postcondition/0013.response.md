Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed). It returns 'Ron' if the stone reaches a specific condition, and 'Hermione' otherwise.**
