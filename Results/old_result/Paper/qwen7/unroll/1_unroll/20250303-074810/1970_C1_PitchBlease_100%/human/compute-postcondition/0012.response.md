The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, with the constraint that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.

The function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of nodes `n`, a list of edges `edges`, and a starting node `start`, and return either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on certain conditions related to the tree structure and the starting node.
