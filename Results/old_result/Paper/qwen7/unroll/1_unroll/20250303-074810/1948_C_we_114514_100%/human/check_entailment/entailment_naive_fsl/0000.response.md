Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Path**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid. It only checks a few specific conditions without fully considering all possible paths the robot could take.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle all possible configurations of arrows in the grid. For example, it does not consider cases where the robot might need to move up or down multiple times to reach the target cell.

3. **Incomplete Path Simulation**: The function does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step across the entire grid, which is necessary to ensure the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
4
6
>>><<<
><>>><
```

The provided solution would incorrectly return "Yes" because it does not properly simulate the robot's path. However, the correct path for this case is:

- Start at (1, 1)
- Move right to (1, 2)
- Move right to (1, 3)
- Move left to (1, 2)
- Move right to (1, 3)
- Move right to (1, 4)
- Move right to (1, 5)
- Move right to (1, 6)
- Move down to (2, 6)

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 6), but the provided solution fails to correctly simulate this path.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output is **False**.
