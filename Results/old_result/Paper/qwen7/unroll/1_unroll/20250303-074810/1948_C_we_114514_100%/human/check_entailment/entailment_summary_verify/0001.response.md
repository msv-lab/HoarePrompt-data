### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not handle all possible scenarios and can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the function only checks certain specific conditions and does not ensure that the robot can actually reach the final cell `(2, n)`. Let's re-evaluate the program using the provided function summaries and the problem description.

#### Function Summaries

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the movement rules.
   - It iterates through the first half of the grid and checks specific conditions to determine if the robot can move past certain points.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns `'No'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It initializes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with these values and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the robot can move past certain points in the grid by ensuring that the arrows do not block the path.
   - It specifically checks:
     - If the arrow at position `2*i + 1` in `row1` is `<`, then the next two positions in `row2` must not both point left (`<`).
     - Similarly, it checks the last column for the same condition.
   - These checks are necessary but not sufficient to guarantee that the robot can reach the final cell `(2, n)`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the input is read and processed correctly.

#### Correctness Analysis

1. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The problem states that `n` is even, which is checked implicitly by the loop in `func_1`.
   - The function correctly handles the boundary conditions for the first and last columns.
   - However, the function does not handle all possible paths and scenarios. It only checks certain specific conditions and does not consider all possible movements.

2. **Detailed Logic Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` assumes that the robot can only move to the next cell if the arrow points in the direction of movement. This is correct.
   - However, the function only checks if the robot can move past certain points and does not ensure that the robot can actually reach the final cell `(2, n)`.
   - The function does not account for the possibility that the robot might get stuck in a loop or unable to progress further due to the arrows' directions.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify with the provided examples:
     - For the first example (`4` columns):
       - `row1 = ">><<"`
       - `row2 = ">>><"`
       - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 4)`.
     - For the second example (`2` columns):
       - `row1 = "><"`
       - `row2 = "><"`
       - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 2)`.
     - For the third example (`4` columns):
       - `row1 = ">>><"`
       - `row2 = ">><<"`
       - The function incorrectly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 4)`, but the correct path is blocked.
     - For the fourth example (`6` columns):
       - `row1 = ">><<><"`
       - `row2 = "><>>><"`
       - The function correctly identifies that the robot can reach `(2, 6)`.

### Conclusion

The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
