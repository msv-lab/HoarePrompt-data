Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers `n` and `k` within specific ranges (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4 indirectly through the test cases. It returns a value based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and `t`.**

Note: The actual return value is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the processing of the parameters rather than the exact return type.
