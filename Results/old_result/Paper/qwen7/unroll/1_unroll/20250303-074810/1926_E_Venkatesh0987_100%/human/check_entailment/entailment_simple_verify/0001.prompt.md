You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

After all the executions of the loop have finished, the value of `y` is printed for each test case based on the conditions given in the loop body. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`) are used during the computation but their final values do not affect the output.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Odd Number Cards:**
   - The program calculates the number of odd-numbered cards using `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than half of `n`, it means the `k`-th card is not among the first half (odd-numbered cards).

3. **Even Number Cards:**
   - For even-numbered cards, the program calculates the position relative to the remaining cards.
   - It uses a loop to adjust the count of remaining cards `d` and increments the index `i`.

4. **Position Calculation:**
   - After determining the relevant group of cards (even or odd), it calculates the exact position within that group.
   - The formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` is used to find the `k`-th card in the sequence of even-numbered cards.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is within the first half of the cards (all odd numbers).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Odd Number Cards:**
   - The logic for handling odd-numbered cards is correct. The first half of the cards are all odd numbers, and the program correctly identifies when `k` falls into this category.

2. **Even Number Cards:**
   - The logic for handling even-numbered cards is also correct. The program correctly identifies the group of even-numbered cards and calculates the position within that group.

3. **Formula Usage:**
   - The formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` is derived from the pattern of laying down cards. This formula correctly maps the position `f` to the actual card number.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `k` is exactly at the boundary between odd and even-numbered cards.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and formulas used are correct according to the problem description. The program correctly identifies the type of card (odd or even) and calculates the exact position within that group.
