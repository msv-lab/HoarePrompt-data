t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m); a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m; the sum of n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
