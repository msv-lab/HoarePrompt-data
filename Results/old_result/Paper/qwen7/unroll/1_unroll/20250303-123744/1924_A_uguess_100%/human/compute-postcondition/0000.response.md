Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
