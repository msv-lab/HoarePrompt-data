### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the given string `s`.
   - If not, it should print "NO" and a counterexample string of length `n`.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which characters have been seen in the current sequence of `s`.
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many unique sequences of length `n` have been found.
   - The variable `ans` stores the last character of the sequence to help form the counterexample if needed.
   - If `cnt` reaches `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a counterexample string `ans` by finding the first missing character and padding with 'a's.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The bitmask logic correctly tracks the presence of each character in the sequence.
   - However, the logic to find the first missing character and construct the counterexample string has a flaw. Specifically, the program assumes that the first missing character in the bitmask is the one that needs to be added to the counterexample string. This is not necessarily true because the bitmask only indicates the presence of characters up to the point where `cnt` reached `n`. It does not guarantee that the missing character is the first one in lexicographical order.

4. **Verification:**
   - Consider the following test case:
     ```
     1
     3 2 6
     ababa
     ```
   - Here, `n = 3`, `k = 2`, and `s = "ababa"`.
   - The possible strings of length 3 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets are: "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", "bbb".
   - The string "ababa" contains the subsequences "aaa", "aab", "aba", "abb", "baa", "bab", "bba", but not "bbb".
   - The program will correctly identify that "bbb" is missing and print "NO".
   - However, the program will incorrectly construct the counterexample string as "b" followed by "a" repeated twice, resulting in "baa". This is incorrect because "baa" is a subsequence of "ababa".

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly identify the first missing character in lexicographical order. It only checks the bitmask and assumes the first missing character is the one to be added to the counterexample string, which is not always true.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the first missing character in lexicographical order when constructing the counterexample string.
