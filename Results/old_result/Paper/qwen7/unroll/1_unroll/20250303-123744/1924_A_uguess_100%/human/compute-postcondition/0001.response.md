Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `t`**:
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts from 0 in the `range(t)` function.

3. **Conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, the loop will execute `t` times.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The value of `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute even once.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is 0 and `t` is at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
