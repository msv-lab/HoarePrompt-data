You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (number of test cases), two integers `n` and `k` (representing the required number of unique characters and the set size respectively), an integer `m` (length of the string `s`), and a string `s` (comprising the first `k` lowercase English alphabets). It then checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` unique characters. If so, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it identifies the first missing character from the last set of `k` characters needed to reach `n` unique characters and constructs a result string consisting of this character followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times, where `cnt` is the count of unique characters found. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all possible test cases. Specifically, it fails to check for subsequences properly. The program uses a bitmask to track which characters have been seen, but it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. Instead, it only checks if a combination of characters has been seen in the string `s`.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
ccc
```

However, the program's output for the second test case is incorrect. The string `aa` is not a subsequence of `abb`, but the program incorrectly prints `YES`. This happens because the program does not correctly track the subsequences of length `n`.

To fix this, the program needs to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if they are subsequences of `s`. The current implementation does not do this, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
