You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        ans = ''
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. After executing the loop, for each test case, either 'YES' is printed indicating that at least n unique characters were found in the string s, or 'NO' is printed followed by a string ans which contains the first character that was missing from the last set of k characters needed to make the count of unique characters at least n, followed by 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, where cnt is the count of unique characters found.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^5), n and k (both integers between 1 and 26), m (an integer between 1 and 1000), and s (a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
