Output State: t is the number of test cases, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets. After executing the loop, for each test case, either 'YES' is printed indicating that at least n unique characters were found in the string s, or 'NO' is printed followed by a string ans which contains the first character that was missing from the last set of k characters needed to make the count of unique characters at least n, followed by 'a' repeated n - cnt - 1 times, where cnt is the count of unique characters found.
