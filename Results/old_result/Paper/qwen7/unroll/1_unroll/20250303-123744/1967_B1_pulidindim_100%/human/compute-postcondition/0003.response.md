Output State: The value of `t` test cases where for each test case, `n` is incremented based on the given logic inside the loop, and the final value of `ans` is printed for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `ans` is updated by adding the integer division of `(g / count) + 1` where `g` is calculated as `n // count` and `countmins` is `count - 1`. The loop continues until `count` exceeds `m` or the condition `g < countmins` is met.
