Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
3. The initial value of `count` is set to 2, which seems to be an arbitrary starting point.
4. The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which might be intended to accumulate the count of valid pairs.
5. A while loop runs from `count = 2` up to `m`, incrementing `count` by 1 each iteration.
6. Inside the loop, `countmins` is calculated as `count - 1`.
7. `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`, which is the integer division of `n` by `count`.
8. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks, indicating that further increments of `count` will not yield valid pairs.
9. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to it.
10. After the loop, the result is printed for each test case.

To verify correctness, we need to check if this logic correctly counts the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions.

Given the problem statement, the formula `a + b` should be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Let's analyze the provided code:

- The loop iterates over possible values of `b` (from 2 to `m`).
- For each `b`, it calculates `countmins` and `g`.
- The update to `ans` using `int(g / count) + 1` seems to be counting how many multiples of `b` fit within `n`.

However, the logic in the loop does not directly address the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it appears to be counting multiples of `b` up to `n`, which is not equivalent to the required condition.

Given the discrepancy between the intended logic and the actual implementation, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
