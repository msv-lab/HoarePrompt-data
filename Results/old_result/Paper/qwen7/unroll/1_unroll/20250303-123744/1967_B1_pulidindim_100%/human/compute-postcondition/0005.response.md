Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `t`, `n`, and `m`. For each test case, it calculates and prints an updated value of `n` based on a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves incrementing `n` by a value derived from dividing `n` by a counter `count`, adjusted by `count - 1`, until the counter exceeds `m` or the division result is less than `count - 1`. The function outputs the final calculated value of `n` for each test case.**
