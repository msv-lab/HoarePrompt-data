State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop condition `i in range(t)` means that the loop will run as long as `i < t`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to 0 to satisfy the initial condition of the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `t` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
- `i` must be 0 to start the loop correctly.
