Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` which iterates over the list `custos`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: Since `c` is iterating over the list `custos`, the initial value of `c` will be the first element of `custos`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `custos`**: For the loop to execute, the list `custos` must contain at least one element.

4. **Consider the Conditions for the Loop**: The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `custos`. Therefore, `custos` must have at least one element for the loop to start executing.

5. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `custos` has at least one element and that `c` is set to the first element of `custos`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `custos` must have at least one element.
- `c` must be set to the first element of `custos`.

Since `t` and `x` are not directly involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state is:
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `custos` is a list containing at least one cumulative cost `custo` calculated for each iteration of the loop based on the given conditions, `c` is the first element of `custos`**.
