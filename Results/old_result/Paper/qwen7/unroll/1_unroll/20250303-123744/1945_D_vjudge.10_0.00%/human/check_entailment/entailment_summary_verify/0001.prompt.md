You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( m \), and lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative cost based on specific conditions involving elements from lists \( a \) and \( b \). The function then prints the cumulative cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it correctly parses the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`) and the maximum allowable final position (`max_p`).

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `custo` to 0, which is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - It then correctly initializes lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the costs from the input.
   - The program iterates backward from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` to calculate the initial cost. This part is correct because it checks whether the cost of moving to the current position is less than the cost of staying at the next position.
   - After calculating the initial cost, the program iterates backward from `max_p - 1` to 1 to ensure that Kirill's final position is within the allowed limit. Here, it checks if moving to the previous position would result in a lower cost compared to staying at the current position. If so, it updates the cost accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where Kirill needs to move to the first position by adding `a_values[0]` to the cost if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the accumulated cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the code.
