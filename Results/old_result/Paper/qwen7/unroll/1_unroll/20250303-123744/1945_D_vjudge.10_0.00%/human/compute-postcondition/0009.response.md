Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( m \), and lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative cost based on specific conditions involving elements from lists \( a \) and \( b \). The function then prints the cumulative cost for each test case.**
