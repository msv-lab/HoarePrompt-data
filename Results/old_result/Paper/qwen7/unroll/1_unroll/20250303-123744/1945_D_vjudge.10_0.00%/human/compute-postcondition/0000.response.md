Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, x is an input integer.**

The code `x = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and is not affected by the code execution.
