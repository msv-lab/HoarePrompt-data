To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem description and the example provided.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `x` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads two lines of space-separated integers representing `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `custo` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` to calculate the cost of moving to positions from `num_fila` to `max_p`.
   - If `a_values[y]` is less than `b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`. Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]`.
   - Then, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1 to calculate the cost of moving to positions from `max_p` to 1.
   - If the cost of moving from `y-1` to `y` (i.e., `a_values[y-1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost of staying at `y` (i.e., `a_values[y]`), it adds `b_values[y]` to `custo`. Otherwise, it adds `a_values[y]` to `custo`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program stores the calculated cost in the list `custos` and prints each cost after processing all test cases.

### Correctness Check:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  6 2
  6 9 7 1 8 3
  5 8 8 1 4 1
  7 7
  7 2 9 2 6 5 9
  9 1 10 7 1 4 9
  2 1
  2 3
  1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  22
  9
  3
  ```

#### Test Case 1: `4 2`
- `a_values = [7, 3, 6, 9]`
- `b_values = [4, 3, 8, 5]`
- Cost calculation:
  - From position 3 to 2: `min(6, 3+8) = 6`
  - From position 2 to 1: `min(3, 7+5) = 7`
- Total cost: `6 + 7 = 13` (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy here; the expected output is 14, which might be due to a different interpretation or a mistake in the example.)

#### Test Case 2: `6 2`
- `a_values = [6, 9, 7, 1, 8, 3]`
- `b_values = [5, 8, 8, 1, 4, 1]`
- Cost calculation:
  - From position 5 to 4: `min(8, 1+4) = 4`
  - From position 4 to 3: `min(1, 9+1) = 1`
  - From position 3 to 2: `min(7, 8+1) = 8`
  - From position 2 to 1: `min(9, 6+1) = 6`
- Total cost: `4 + 1 + 8 + 6 = 19` (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy here; the expected output is 22, which might be due to a different interpretation or a mistake in the example.)

#### Test Case 3: `7 7`
- `a_values = [7, 2, 9, 2, 6, 5, 9]`
- `b_values = [9, 1, 10, 7, 1, 4, 9]`
- Cost calculation:
  - From position 6 to 5: `min(5, 1+1) = 1`
  - From position 5 to 4: `min(6, 7+1) = 7`
  - From position 4 to 3: `min(2, 9+7) = 2`
  - From position 3 to 2: `min(9, 2+7) = 9`
  - From position 2 to 1: `min(2, 9+9) = 9`
- Total cost: `1 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 9 = 28` (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy here; the expected output is 9, which might be due to a different interpretation or a mistake in the example.)

#### Test Case 4: `2 1`
- `a_values = [2, 3]`
- `b_values = [1, 1]`
- Cost calculation:
  - From position 1 to 0: `min(2, 1+1) = 1`
- Total cost: `1`
- Output: `1`

### Conclusion:
The program seems to have logical errors in the cost calculation process, leading to incorrect outputs for some test cases. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: False**
