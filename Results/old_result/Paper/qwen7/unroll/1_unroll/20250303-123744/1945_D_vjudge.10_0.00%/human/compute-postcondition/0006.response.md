Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` which is iterating over the list `custos`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost `custo` calculated for each iteration of the loop.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `custos`. 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `custos` must contain at least one element.
   - The variable `c` will take the value of the first element in the list `custos` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `custos` must have at least one element.
- `c` will be set to the first element of `custos`.

Given this, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`custos` must have at least one element, `c` is the first element in the list `custos`**.
