Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`x`) and processes each test case individually. It correctly extracts `n` and `m` for each test case and reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost of moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions. It starts from the end of the queue and works backwards, choosing the cheaper option between swapping with the current position or moving further back.
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems correct. It checks whether it's cheaper to swap with the current position (`a_values[y]`) or to move further back (`b_values[y]`).

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - The program handles the boundary condition where it might need to stop early if it finds that moving further back would be more expensive than staying in the current position.
   - It also correctly handles the case where Kirill reaches the front of the queue.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the total cost for each test case correctly.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program appears to follow the problem description accurately and performs the necessary calculations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
