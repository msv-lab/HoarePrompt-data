State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x`.
2. **Determine Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0, as specified by the `range(x)` function.
3. **Determine Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < x`. Therefore, for the loop to start executing, `x` must be greater than 0.
4. **Other Variables**: The variable `custos` being empty and `t` being a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) do not directly affect the loop's execution and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` initialized to 0 and `x` must be greater than 0.
