Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, meaning no vertices are initially connected to any vertex. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` is now defined as a list of `n` empty lists.
