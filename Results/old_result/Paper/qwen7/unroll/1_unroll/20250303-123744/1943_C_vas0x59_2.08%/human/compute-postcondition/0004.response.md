Output State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its adjacent nodes based on user inputs (u, v) for `n-1` iterations. Each pair (u, v) represents an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`, with both nodes appending each other to their respective lists.
