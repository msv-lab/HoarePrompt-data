Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists where `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of vertices connected to vertex `i`.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `u2vs` remains unchanged. The precondition that the input graph is guaranteed to be a tree is still valid.
