You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop. For each line of input provided during the loop, the program checks the relationship between `n` and `m`, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. If `t` is the number of iterations, there will be `t` lines of output, each either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on the values of `n` and `m` for that iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.

2. **Conditions for "Yes":**
   - If `n == m`, it means that Nikita can simply add one cube at a time for `n` moves, resulting in `m` cubes. This condition is correctly handled.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer should be "No". This condition is also correctly handled.
   - If `m == n - 1`, Nikita can add one cube at a time for `n-1` moves and then remove one cube, resulting in `m` cubes. This condition is correctly handled.
   - If both `n` and `m` are even, Nikita can add and remove cubes in such a way that he ends up with `m` cubes. This condition is correctly handled.
   - If both `n` and `m` are odd, Nikita can also achieve `m` cubes through a combination of adding and removing cubes. This condition is correctly handled.

3. **Conditions for "No":**
   - All other cases where the conditions above do not match should result in "No". However, there is an issue in the logic. Specifically, the condition `elif m == n - 1:` is redundant because it is already covered by the general logic of adding and removing cubes. Also, the condition `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:` and `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:` are unnecessary and can be simplified.

4. **Simplified Logic:**
   - The program can be simplified to:
     ```python
     def func():
         t = int(input())
         for i in range(t):
             (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
             if n == m or (m == n - 1) or (n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0) or (n % 2 != 0 and m % 2 != 0):
                 print('Yes')
             else:
                 print('No')
     ```

### Conclusion:
The original program handles all necessary conditions correctly but includes redundant checks. After simplifying the logic, the program still works as intended.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
