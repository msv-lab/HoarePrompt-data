State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop condition `i < t` must hold true for the loop to execute at least once.
3. Since `t` is obtained from user input as an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, it must be within this range for the loop to execute.
4. At the start of the loop, `i` is set to 0.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and `i` is initialized to 0.
