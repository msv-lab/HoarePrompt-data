Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three values: t, n, and m, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers between 1 and 100. Based on these values, the function returns a result without specifying what that result is.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases defined by `t`, where for each test case, it takes two additional parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers between 1 and 100, and returns some unspecified result after processing these values.
