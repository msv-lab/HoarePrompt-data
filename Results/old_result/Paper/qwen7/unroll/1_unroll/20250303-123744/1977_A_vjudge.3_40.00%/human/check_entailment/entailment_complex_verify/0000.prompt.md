You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop. For each line of input provided during the loop, the program checks the relationship between `n` and `m`, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly. If `t` is the number of iterations, there will be `t` lines of output, each either 'Yes' or 'No', depending on the values of `n` and `m` for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on specific conditions. Specifically, it prints 'Yes' if `n` equals `m`, `m` is greater than `n` by exactly 1, both `n` and `m` are even, or both `n` and `m` are odd; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes with a series of 'Yes' and 'No' outputs corresponding to the conditions evaluated for each pair of `n` and `m`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only end up with a tower of `m` cubes if the parity (odd or even nature) of `m` and `n` matches. However, the current implementation does not account for this properly.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `m = 3`. Here, `n` is even and `m` is odd, which should result in "No" according to the problem description. However, the program incorrectly prints "Yes" in this case because it only checks for specific conditions like `m == n - 1` or both being even/odd without considering the general parity check.
