Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases (t) and for each test case, an integer n. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for n.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases where each case involves an integer `n`. For each `n`, if `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), the function performs some operation and returns a result. If `n` does not meet the specified range, the behavior is not explicitly defined in the given information. Additionally, the function processes a total of `t` such test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
