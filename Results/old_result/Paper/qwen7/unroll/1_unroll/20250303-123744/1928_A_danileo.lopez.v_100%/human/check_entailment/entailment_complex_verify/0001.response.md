### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle by cutting an \(a \times b\) rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always achieve this by cutting the rectangle in half along the even dimension and then rearranging the pieces.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even:
     - If \(a\) is even, it checks if \(a // 2\) is not equal to \(b\). If true, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
     - If \(b\) is even, it checks if \(b // 2\) is not equal to \(a\). If true, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next test case.
     - If neither condition is met, it prints 'No'.
   - If neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is even, it directly prints 'No'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the conditions under which Bob can form a different rectangle:
     - If \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle in half along that dimension and rearrange the pieces to form a different rectangle.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle since cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where \(a\) or \(b\) is 1 (which is odd), and it correctly identifies that such cases cannot form a different rectangle.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic when both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. The program should check if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle, but it does not do so.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.**
  - The current logic checks if \(a // 2 \neq b\) or \(b // 2 \neq a\). This is not sufficient.
  - For example, consider \(a = 4\) and \(b = 6\):
    - Cutting \(4 \times 6\) into two \(2 \times 6\) rectangles and then rearranging them can form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.
    - The current logic would incorrectly print 'No' because \(2 \neq 6\).

- **Case 2: Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.**
  - The current logic correctly prints 'No' because cutting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, and no combination of these can form a different rectangle.

### Corrected Logic:

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, we check if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle. We can do this by checking if either \(a // 2\) or \(b // 2\) can form a different rectangle with the other dimension.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            if a // 2 != b or b // 2 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if a % 2 == 0:
            a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
            if a1 != b:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        if b % 2 == 0:
            b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
            if b1 != a:
                print('Yes')
                continue
        print('No')
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because it did not account for the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even and the resulting smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle. The corrected logic ensures that the program correctly identifies all cases where Bob can form a different rectangle.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
