Functionality: The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)). It calculates \(mn\) as the sum of the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) and \(m\). Depending on whether \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1, it prints either \(mn // a + mn // b + 1\) or \(mn // a + mn // b\). The function outputs a list of these results for all test cases.
