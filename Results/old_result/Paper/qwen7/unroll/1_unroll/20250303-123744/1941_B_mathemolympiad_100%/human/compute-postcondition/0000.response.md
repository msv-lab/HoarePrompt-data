Output State: **`numTest` is an integer input, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

In this state, the variable `numTest` has been updated to the integer value input by the user, while all other variables and conditions remain as per the initial state.
