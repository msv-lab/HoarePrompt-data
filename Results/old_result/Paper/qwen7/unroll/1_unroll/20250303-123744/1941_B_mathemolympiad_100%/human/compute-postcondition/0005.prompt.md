You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for all test cases, for each test case, if there exists any negative value in the array `a` before the end of the array (i.e., indices from 0 to n-3), the program prints 'NO' for that test case and moves to the next test case. If no negative values are found and the last two elements of the array are zero, the program prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, and the array `a` itself, which contains `n` integers. The function returns information based on the array `a` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
