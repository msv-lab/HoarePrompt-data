### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program processes the array by iterating through indices from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), which is correct since the operation is defined for `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.
3. **Operation Application**: The program applies the operation as specified, reducing `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Early Termination**: If any element becomes negative during the process, the program prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This is also correct.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'. This check ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the program:

- The program only checks the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) after applying the operations. This is insufficient because the operations can affect the entire array, and simply checking the last two elements does not guarantee that the entire array can be reduced to zero.
- For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The program correctly reduces the array to `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]` and then to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. However, the program does not check if intermediate steps lead to a situation where the array cannot be reduced further.

To properly verify if all elements can be reduced to zero, the program should ensure that no negative values are introduced during the operations and that the sum of the array remains non-negative throughout the process.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program fails to ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros by only checking the last two elements after the operations.

### Final:
**False**
