Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
2. The solution provided correctly handles the two conditions specified:
   - If \( 4n - 2 = k \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

3. The logic in the code matches the problem statement:
   - The condition `if 4 * n - 2 == k:` checks if the exact number of diagonals required is equal to the total number of diagonals in the grid.
   - If true, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
   - If false, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

4. The use of `ceil` ensures that when \( k \) is odd, the ceiling function correctly rounds up to the nearest integer, which is necessary for the second condition.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
