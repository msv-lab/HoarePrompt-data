You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that the sum of p_i is at least 1.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `cnt` is calculated based on the input lists `a`. For each test case, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd, and then `cnt` is further incremented by half the value of each element in the list, rounded down. The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` based on the input list `a` containing four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence. It increments `cnt` by 1 if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd, and then increments `cnt` by half the value of each element in the list, rounded down. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `cnt` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes one number at a time, aiming to maximize the number of Bob's wins.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to count the number of Bob's wins.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:` checks if there are equal numbers of ones, twos, and threes, and if this count is odd.
   - If true, it increments `cnt` by 1. However, this check does not align with the problem requirements. The goal is to maximize Bob's wins, not to increment `cnt` under specific conditions.

4. **Count Calculation**:
   - The loop `for x in a:` iterates over the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
   - For each count `x`, it adds `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the bitwise XOR operation and the optimal removal strategy.

5. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cnt` is printed, which is supposed to represent the maximum number of Bob's wins.

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program incorrectly calculates the number of Bob's wins by simply summing up half of each count of numbers. This does not reflect the actual strategy to maximize Bob's wins.
- The condition check `a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1` is irrelevant to the problem and does not contribute to the correct solution.
- The logic to determine the maximum number of Bob's wins should involve understanding the bitwise XOR operation and the optimal removal strategy, which is not implemented in the given code.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
