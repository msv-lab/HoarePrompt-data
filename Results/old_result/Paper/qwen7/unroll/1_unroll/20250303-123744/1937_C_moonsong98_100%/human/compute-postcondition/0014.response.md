Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `min_indices`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop iterates over each element in `min_indices`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element in `min_indices`. This is because the loop starts with the first element and then moves to the next one.

3. **Determine the State of `min_indices`**: The variable `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all elements `i` in the range 0 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns either '<' or '='. For the loop to start, `min_indices` must contain at least one element (i.e., it must be non-empty).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must be set to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - `min_indices` must be a non-empty list.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character in the string representation of numbers from 0 to n-1 that is less than the character at index `max_index`, or 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a non-empty list containing the indices of all elements `i` in the range 0 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns either '<' or '=', `min_index` is `min_indices[0]`, `i` is the first element in `min_indices`**.
