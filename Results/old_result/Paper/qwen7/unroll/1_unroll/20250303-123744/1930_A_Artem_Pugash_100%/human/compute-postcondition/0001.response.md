Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the loop, the score variable holds the sum of every first element in each pair from the sorted list l.
