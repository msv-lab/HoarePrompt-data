Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the loop, the score is calculated as the sum of the first and third, fifth, etc., elements in the sorted list l for each test case, and printed for each test case.
