Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for all test cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Here's an example to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
<><
```

Expected output:
```
1 3 2
```

However, the program produces:
```
1 4 2
```

This discrepancy arises because the program incorrectly calculates the time taken for the pinball to move through the grid. For instance, in the third position (`i=2`), the pinball should take 3 seconds to leave the grid, but the program outputs 4 seconds.

The core issue lies in the way the program handles the calculation of the time taken for the pinball to move through the grid, particularly in the nested loops and conditional checks. The program needs to correctly account for the direction changes and the distance traveled by the pinball.
