Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball moves based on the direction ('<' or '>') at each cell, and the direction is inverted after each move.

2. **Analyze the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s`.
   - Inside `func_1`, two lists `A` and `B` are computed, representing the cumulative sums of positions of '>' and '<' characters respectively, adjusted by the number of intermediate characters.
   - The main logic for calculating the time taken for each pinball to leave the grid is implemented in the nested loops and conditional checks.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The computation of `A` and `B` correctly captures the cumulative effects of moving left and right based on the directions of the characters.
   - The nested loops and conditional checks in the main part of the function correctly handle the transitions between different parts of the grid and compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as the pinball starting at the boundaries of the grid.
   - It correctly adjusts the cumulative sums based on the positions and counts of '>' and '<' characters.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The calculations for the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid are correctly implemented.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and implements the required functionality accurately.

Correctness: **True**
