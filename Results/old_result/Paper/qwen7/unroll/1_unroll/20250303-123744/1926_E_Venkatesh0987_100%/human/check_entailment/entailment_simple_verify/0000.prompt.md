You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle the correct sequence of laying down cards according to the rules provided. 

Let's analyze the issue with an example. Consider the input `7 4`:

- According to the problem description, the sequence of laying down cards should be:
  1. Odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
  2. Cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6
  3. Cards that are three times an odd number: 6 (but since 6 is already laid down, we skip this step)
  4. Cards that are four times an odd number: 12 (but since 12 is greater than 7, we skip this step)

So, the correct sequence is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.

However, the program attempts to compute the k-th card using a different approach. For `k = 4`, the program incorrectly calculates the result as `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, which does not match the expected sequence.

To verify, let's run through the steps of the program for `n = 7` and `k = 4`:

1. The program checks if `k > (n + 1) // 2`. Since `k = 4` and `(n + 1) // 2 = 4`, it enters the first loop.
2. In the first loop, it calculates `s += (d + 1) // 2` and `d -= (d + 1) // 2` until `s >= k`. This results in `d = 0` after the loop.
3. It then calculates `g += (h + 1) // 2` and `h -= (h + 1) // 2` until `p >= i`. This results in `h = 0`.
4. Finally, it computes `f = k - g` and `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`, which gives `y = 2 ** 0 * (2 * 4 - 1) = 7`.

This result (`y = 7`) does not match the expected sequence, where the 4th card is `4`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
