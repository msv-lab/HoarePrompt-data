Output State: The output state consists of the results of `m` queries for each test case. For each query, if `y > x`, the output is the value of `d1[y] - d1[x]`. If `y <= x`, the output is the value of `d2[y] - d2[x]`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are computed based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `l`.
