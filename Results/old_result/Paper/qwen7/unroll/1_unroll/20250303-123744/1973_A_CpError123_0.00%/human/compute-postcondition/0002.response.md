Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is a list of non-negative integers or -1 based on the conditions specified in the loop. Each element in `resultats` is calculated as follows: if the total points (p1 + p2 + p3) is odd, the corresponding result is -1; if the total matches (total_points // 2) exceed 3 or if p3 exceeds the total matches, the result is -1; otherwise, the result is half of the number of equalities calculated as (total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)).
