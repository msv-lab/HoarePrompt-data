Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` which is being unpacked from the elements of `cas_de_test`. Therefore, the objects involved are `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `cas_de_test`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `cas_de_test`. Each element of `cas_de_test` is a list containing three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` that satisfy the condition `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.

3. **Adjust the states**: Since the loop will continue as long as `cas_de_test` has elements, we need to ensure that `cas_de_test` is not empty. Additionally, since `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are part of the loop, they will be initialized to the values from the first element of `cas_de_test` when the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `cas_de_test` should not be empty because the loop will iterate over its elements.
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` should be set to the values from the first element of `cas_de_test`.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `cas_de_test` is a non-empty list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, `resultats` is an empty list, `p1` is the first element of the first inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p2` is the second element of the first inner list in `cas_de_test`, `p3` is the third element of the first inner list in `cas_de_test`**.
