Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. For each inner list in `cas_de_test`, the function evaluates the integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 and returns a list of results, where each result is either a non-negative integer or -1 based on specified conditions.**
