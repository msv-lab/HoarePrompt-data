### Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases Initialization**: 
   - The program initializes `t` to 7 and defines a list `cas_de_test` containing predefined test cases. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `t` and `cas_de_test` as input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case `(p1, p2, p3)`, it calculates the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`).
   - It checks if the total points are even (`if total_points % 2 != 0`). If not, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - It checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 or if `p3` is greater than the total number of matches (`if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs`). If either condition is true, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - It calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)` and then divides by 2 to get the number of draws (`egalites // 2`). This calculation is correct.
   - If the calculated number of draws is negative, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating an inconsistency. This check is correct.
   - Otherwise, it appends the number of draws to the results.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case and handles inconsistencies appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
