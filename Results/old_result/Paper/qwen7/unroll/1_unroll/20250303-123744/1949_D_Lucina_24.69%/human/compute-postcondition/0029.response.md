Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of `n` lines, where each line represents transitions between scenarios. Each character in the line indicates the type of transition video ('F' for funny, 'S' for scary, '?' for undecided, or '.' for no transition needed). The function determines the undecided transitions ('?') based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' already decided and returns the filled matrix of transitions. If the number of indices with only 'F' transitions is greater than or equal to those with only 'S' transitions, it sets undecided transitions to 'F'; otherwise, it sets them to 'S'.**
