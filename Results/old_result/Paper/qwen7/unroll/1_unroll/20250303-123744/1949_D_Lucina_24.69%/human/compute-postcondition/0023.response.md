Output State: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of 'F' received from the corresponding index in `x`; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of 'S' received from the corresponding index in `x`; `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each string being the input received in each iteration of the loop; `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`; `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, and after the loop executes, `sb` will contain all indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`.
