Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an input consisting of n lines, where each line represents transitions between scenarios. Each character in the line indicates the type of transition video ('F' for funny, 'S' for scary, '?' for undecided, or '.' for no transition needed). The function determines the undecided transitions ('?') based on the given constraints and returns the filled matrix of transitions.**

This functionality describes a function that takes no explicit parameters but processes an implied input structure (n lines with specific characters) to resolve undecided transition types ('?') based on given constraints and returns the updated matrix of transitions.
