Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(1, n + 1)`. Therefore, the variables that need to be considered are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `i` should start at 1.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `n`**: The value of `n` is given as an input integer between 2 and 24. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Given the constraint that `n` is between 2 and 24, we can set `n` to be within this range.

4. **Adjust the State**: Based on the above points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is within the valid range (2 to 24).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24, and `i` is 1**.
