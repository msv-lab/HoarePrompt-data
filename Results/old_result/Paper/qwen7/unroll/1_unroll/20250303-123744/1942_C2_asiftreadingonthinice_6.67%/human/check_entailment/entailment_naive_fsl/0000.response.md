Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are consecutive. For example, consider the following input:

```
3
8 4 2
1 2 3 4
```

In this case, the vertices chosen by Bessie are consecutive, and the program fails to account for the fact that additional vertices can be chosen to maximize the number of triangles. The correct approach would be to check if the gaps between the chosen vertices can be filled to form more triangles. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario properly.
