Output State: **`ans` is [1, 2, 4, 2]**.

Explanation: Initially, `ans` is `[1, 2, 4]`. The code appends a new value to `ans`, which is calculated as `k - 1 - sum(ans)`. Here, `k` is not explicitly defined, but since it's not given and no other variable is assigned to `k`, we assume `k` is implicitly referring to the length of `ans` plus one (which is 4). So, `sum(ans)` is `1 + 2 + 4 = 7`. Therefore, the new value appended is `4 - 1 - 7 = -4 + 1 = -3 + 4 = 2`. Hence, `ans` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 2]`.
