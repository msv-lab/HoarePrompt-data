You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is initially 0, updating `processing` and `tmp` accordingly. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns this value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not equal to 0) and returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

        #Explanation: The loop starts with `i` being 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l`. Given `l` is the length of `b`, and initially `ans` is `[2, 3]`, we can infer that `l` is initially 2 (since the length of `[2, 3]` is 2). However, the loop starts from `i = 2` and goes up to `l - 1`, so it will run once for `i = 2` and once for `i = 3`, appending `2 ** 2 = 4` and `2 ** 3 = 8` to `ans`. After the loop, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` remains 1, `l` is now 4 (since we appended two more elements to `ans`), and `n` remains not equal to 2.

    #State: `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2, starting from \(2^2\) up to \(2^{l-1}\), where \(l\) is the length of the binary representation `b` of `n`. `k` is either 1 or `k + 1`, and `n` is not equal to 2.

    #The program returns the length of the list `ans` as a string followed by a newline character, then the elements of `ans` joined by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string representing the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing specific values based on the binary representation of `n` and the value of `k`, and then returns the length of this list along with its elements formatted as described.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no integer `k` such that `1 <= k <= 10^6` and the sum of any subsequence of `a` equals `k`.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the numbers printed by `func_14()` for each iteration of the loop, with each number written on a new line. The total number of lines will be equal to the return value of `func_10()`. Each number printed is determined by the implementation of `func_14()`. Since the exact behavior of `func_10()` and `func_14()` is not specified, the specific numbers cannot be determined, but they will form a sequence of integers based on the function definitions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it prints a sequence of integers to the standard output. The number of integers printed is determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and each integer is generated by calling `func_14()`. The specific values printed depend on the implementations of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, but they form a sequence of integers.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - Functions 1-14 are not used in the final solution.
   - Function 15 reads the number of test cases and calls function 14 for each test case.
   - Function 14 is the main logic to generate the required sequence.

3. **Function 14 Logic**:
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representation.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n` is 2.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans`:
     - For `k == 1`, it uses powers of 2.
     - For general `k`, it includes powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`, a value to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`, and additional values to cover remaining gaps.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in function 14 ensures that:
     - No subsequence sums to `k` because the critical value is added to ensure this.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed as subsequence sums due to the inclusion of appropriate powers of 2 and additional values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case when `k == 1` and `n == 2` separately, which is correct.
   - For other cases, the constructed sequence ensures the required properties.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
