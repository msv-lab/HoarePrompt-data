Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence of integers of size at most 25 such that no subsequence sums to `k`, but every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_7()`: Reads multiple integers from standard input and returns them as a list.
   - `func_14()`: Constructs and returns the required sequence based on the given `n` and `k`.
   - `func_15()`: Reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, calls `func_14()` and prints the result.

3. **Key Function `func_14()`**:
   - It handles the construction of the sequence based on the binary representation of `n` and the value of `k`.
   - If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, it returns '1\n2'.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing specific values based on the binary representation of `n` and the value of `k`.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence construction logic in `func_14()` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing every integer from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be represented as a subsequence sum.
   - The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

5. **Function Calls**:
   - `func_15()` correctly calls `func_10()` to get the number of test cases and then calls `func_14()` for each test case, printing the results.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
