The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not equal to 0) and returns a tuple of three values. If `b` is 0, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates and returns `(y, x - a // b * y, g)` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which finds integers `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
