Output State: `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`, `k` is 1, `l` is 4, `n` is not equal to 2.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l`. Since `l` is the length of `b`, and initially `ans` is `[2, 3]`, `l` must be 4 (because the length of `[2, 3]` is 2, and we append elements for `i` from 2 to 3, making the total length 4). The loop appends `2 ** i` to `ans` for each iteration of `i`. So, it appends `2 ** 2` (which is 4) and `2 ** 3` (which is 8) to `ans`. Thus, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. The values of `k`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
