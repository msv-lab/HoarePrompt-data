Output State: The output state consists of the results printed by `func_14()` for each iteration of the loop, followed by a newline character after each call. The number of iterations is determined by `func_10()`. Without knowing the exact implementations of `func_10()` and `func_14()`, we can only describe the structure of the output state in terms of these functions' behavior.
