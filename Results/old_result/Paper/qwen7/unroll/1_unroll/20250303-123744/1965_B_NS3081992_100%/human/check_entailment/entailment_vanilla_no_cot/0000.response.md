Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Generating Sequence**:
   - If `k` is 1, it handles this special case separately.
   - Otherwise, it converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - It constructs the sequence `ans` based on these binary representations and additional values to ensure the conditions are met.
3. **Output**: For each test case, it outputs the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

The logic in `func_14` ensures that:
- No subsequence sums to `k`.
- All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

Since the problem guarantees that a solution always exists and the provided code correctly generates such sequences, the program is correct.
