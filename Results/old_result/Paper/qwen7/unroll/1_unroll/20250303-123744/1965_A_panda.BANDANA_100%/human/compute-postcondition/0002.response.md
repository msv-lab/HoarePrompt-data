Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the list `lis` contains 1 or has only one unique element, it will print 'Alice'. Otherwise, it checks the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted unique list `lis`. If any gap is greater than 1, it prints 'Bob' if the index `j` is odd, and 'Alice' if `j` is even. If no such gap is found, it prints 'Alice' if the length of `lis` is odd, and 'Bob' if it is even.
