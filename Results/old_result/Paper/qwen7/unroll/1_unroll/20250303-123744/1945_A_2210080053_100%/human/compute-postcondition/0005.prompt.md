You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        a, b, c = map(int, s.split())
        
        b += c
        
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. After the loop executes all the iterations, for each test case, b has been updated to b + c, and the output prints (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]. The values of a and c return to their initial states after each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the number of introverts (a) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and the values of b and c are also within their specified ranges, the function processes these values but does not return anything explicitly. The function's primary action is to handle and process these test cases according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
