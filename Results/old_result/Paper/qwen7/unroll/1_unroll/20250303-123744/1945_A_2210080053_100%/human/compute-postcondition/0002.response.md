Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, where for each iteration, b is updated to b + c, and the print statement outputs either (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]. The final state of a, b, and c after all iterations will depend on the initial values of a, b, and c for each test case, but the overall state will reflect the transformations applied by the loop.
