Reasoning:
The given program seems to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly. Here's a breakdown of the steps and their correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating Sequence L**: For each test case, the program calculates the sequence `L` by repeatedly halving `n` (rounded up) until `n` becomes zero. This sequence represents the number of cards laid down at each step.
3. **Determining the k-th Card**: The program then iterates over the sequence `L` to find the position where `k` falls within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`. Based on this position, it calculates and prints the corresponding card number.
4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct k-th card for each test case.

Given the execution summary and the steps outlined above, the program appears to be implementing the logic correctly as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
