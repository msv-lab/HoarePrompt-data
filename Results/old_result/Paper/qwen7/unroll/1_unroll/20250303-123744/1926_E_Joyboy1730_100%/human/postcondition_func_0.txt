The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, and k. It first checks if t is within the range 1 to 50,000. If valid, it reads t test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a sequence L by repeatedly halving n (rounded up) until n becomes zero. Then, it determines the position where k falls within the cumulative sum of elements in L and computes and prints a specific value based on this position. The function outputs a series of results, one for each test case.
