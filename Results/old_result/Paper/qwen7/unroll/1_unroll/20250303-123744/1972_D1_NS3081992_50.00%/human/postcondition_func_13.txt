The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It adjusts each element in `a` that is less than `m` to be equal to `m` and decreases `k` by the total difference between these elements and `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0 after adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
