Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Specifically, the calculation for `z` and `m` does not accurately reflect the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Let's consider a specific case to illustrate the issue:
- For the input `(x, y) = (12, 4)`, the program should calculate the number of screens required to fit these icons. According to the problem description, we need to fit 4 icons of size 2x2, which occupy 4 cells each, and 12 icons of size 1x1, which occupy 1 cell each. Since each screen can hold up to 15 cells, we can fit 2 icons of size 2x2 and 11 icons of size 1x1 on one screen, plus one additional screen for the remaining 1 icon of size 1x1. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2 screens.

However, the program calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can be placed (`z = (y + 1) // 2`), and then attempts to calculate the remaining space and number of additional screens needed. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the placement of 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we correctly calculate the total number of cells required and then divide by the number of cells per screen (15). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells_needed = 4 * y + x
        screens_needed = (total_cells_needed + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
        print(screens_needed)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the total number of cells required is calculated correctly and then divides by the number of cells per screen using ceiling division to get the minimum number of screens needed.
