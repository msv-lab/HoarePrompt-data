### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, so each screen can hold up to 15 icons (since 5 * 3 = 15).

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The number of 2x2 icons that can fit into `z` screens is `(y + 1) // 2`.
   - This is because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and we need to account for the ceiling value when dividing by 4.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space on the `z` screens is `15 * z - y * 4`.
   - This calculation gives us the total number of 1x1 cells available after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space (`m`) is less than the number of 1x1 icons (`x`), we need additional screens.
   - The number of additional screens required is `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`, which ensures we round up correctly.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The total number of screens required is `z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`.

6. **Review of the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `x` and `y`.
   - It calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`.
   - It calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`.
   - If `m` is less than `a`, it adds the required number of additional screens.
   - Finally, it prints the result.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the provided code seems to follow the steps outlined above.
- The formulae used are correct and handle the placement of both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
- The rounding and additional screen calculations are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.

**Correctness: True**
