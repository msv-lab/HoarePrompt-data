Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, there are four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers, each representing the result of the print statement for each test case. For each test case, the result is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2. The value 0 or 1 is determined by whether the first three elements of the list `p` (representing counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are all odd, and then adding the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.
    #
    #For example, if the input for a test case is "3" followed by "1 2 3 4", the list `p` would be [1, 2, 3, 4]. The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` evaluates to 0 because not all of the first three elements are odd. Then, `sum(p) // 2` is `10 // 2`, which is 5. So the output for this test case would be `5`.
    #
    #Output State: A series of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1 plus the sum of the elements in the list `p` divided by 2 for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. For each test case, it checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, it sets the result to 1; otherwise, it sets the result to 0. Then, it adds half the sum of all counts (rounded down) to this result. The function outputs a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the computed results.
