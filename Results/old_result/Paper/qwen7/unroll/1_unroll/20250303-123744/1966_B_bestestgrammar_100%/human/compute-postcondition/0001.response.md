Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for tc in range(t):`.
   - The variables involved in the loop head are `tc` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop `for tc in range(t)` will iterate from `tc = 0` to `tc = t-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`, and if `t` is 0, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `tc` will start at 0 in the first iteration, but since we are only asked to adjust the state before the loop starts, we do not need to specify its initial value.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
