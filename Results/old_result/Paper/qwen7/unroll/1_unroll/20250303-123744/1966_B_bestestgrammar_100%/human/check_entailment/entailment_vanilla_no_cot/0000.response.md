Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw. It checks only the corners of the grid and some adjacent cells, but it doesn't cover all necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check if all rows and all columns have the same color. Hereâ€™s why the current solution is incorrect:

1. **Insufficient Checks**: The current solution only checks the first row, first column, last row, and last column for uniformity. This is not sufficient because there could be uniformity within other rows and columns that are not checked.

2. **General Case**: To ensure all squares can be made the same color, every row and every column must initially be of the same color. If even one row or one column has mixed colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color using the given operations.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows have the same color
        all_rows_same = all(gr[0] == row for row in gr)
        
        # Check if all columns have the same color
        all_columns_same = all(all(gr[i][j] == gr[0][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m))
        
        if all_rows_same or all_columns_same:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

```

This solution checks if all rows or all columns are the same color, which is the correct approach to solving the problem.
