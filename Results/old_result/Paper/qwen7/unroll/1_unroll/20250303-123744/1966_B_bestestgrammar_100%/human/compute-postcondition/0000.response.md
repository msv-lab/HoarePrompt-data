Output State: **t is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is now updated to the integer input provided by the user. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
