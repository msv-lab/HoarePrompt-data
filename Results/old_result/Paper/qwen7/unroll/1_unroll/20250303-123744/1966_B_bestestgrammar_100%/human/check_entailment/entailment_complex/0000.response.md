Reasoning:
The provided solution checks if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by ensuring that the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same color. If they are the same, the function proceeds to check if the entire grid can be made uniform by verifying that no row or column transitions between the top and bottom or left and right have different colors. This approach is correct because:

1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) corners are the same color. If they are not, it immediately sets `ans` to 'NO' since it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if these corners differ.

2. **Row and Column Checks**: 
   - It then checks if all elements in each row from the top to the bottom are the same color. If any row has differing colors, it sets `impossible` to `False`.
   - Similarly, it checks if all elements in each column from the left to the right are the same color. If any column has differing colors, it again sets `impossible` to `False`.

3. **Final Decision**: If `impossible` remains `True`, it means all rows and columns transition uniformly, and thus, the entire grid can be made the same color. Therefore, `ans` is set to 'YES'.

Given the logic and the checks performed, the provided solution correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

Correctness: **True**
