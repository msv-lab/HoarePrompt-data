### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations. An operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the top-left corner square and the bottom-right corner square have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color because any operation would only affect a subrectangle that includes both corners.
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, we need to check if there are any other conflicting colors in the grid.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`.
   - It checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. If they don't, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` and exits.
   - If the corners have the same color, it further checks if there are any other conflicting colors in the grid by examining the first row and the last column. If any of these checks fail, it sets `ans` to `'NO'`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the impossible scenario where the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors.
   - However, the additional checks for the first row and last column are not sufficient to guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform. These checks only verify that the first row and the last column do not contain conflicting colors but do not ensure that the entire grid can be made uniform.
   - Consider the following counterexample:
     ```
     2 2
     BB
     BB
     ```
     According to the current logic, this should return `'YES'`, but it does not account for the possibility of having conflicting colors elsewhere in the grid. For instance, if the grid were:
     ```
     BW
     WB
     ```
     The current logic would incorrectly return `'YES'` because the first row and last column do not conflict, even though the entire grid cannot be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The additional checks for the first row and last column are insufficient and can lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
