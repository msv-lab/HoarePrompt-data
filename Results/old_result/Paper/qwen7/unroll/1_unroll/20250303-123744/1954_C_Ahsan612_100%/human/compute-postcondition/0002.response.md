Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits, each of the same length as the input strings `x` and `y`. For each position in these strings:

- The first string (from the `new` list) contains the maximum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit thereafter.
- The second string (from the `new2` list) contains the minimum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit thereafter.
