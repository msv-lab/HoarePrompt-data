The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and n is even), and two strings `row1` and `row2` each consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. It checks if it's possible to pair up all characters in `row1` and `row2` such that each '<' in `row1` is paired with a '>' in `row2` and vice versa, forming valid pairs. If such a pairing is possible, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
