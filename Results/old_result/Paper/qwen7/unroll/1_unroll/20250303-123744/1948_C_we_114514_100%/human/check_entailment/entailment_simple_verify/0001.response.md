### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the provided function `func_1` is incorrect because it fails to handle certain cases where the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to verify this conclusion.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Loop Through Middle Columns**:
   - The loop iterates through the first half of the grid (excluding the last column).
   - For each column `i` (from 0 to `half_n - 2`), it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2*i + 1` is `<` and if the arrows in `row2` at positions `2*i` or `2*i + 2` are also `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'` because the robot cannot escape to the right.

2. **Check Last Column Separately**:
   - After the loop, it checks the last column separately.
   - If the arrow in `row1` at position `n - 1` is `<` and the arrow in `row2` at position `n - 2` is `<`, it returns `'No'`.

3. **Return 'Yes' if No Conditions Are Met**:
   - If none of the conditions are met, it returns `'Yes'`.

#### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Middle Columns**:
   - The function assumes that if the robot encounters a left-pointing arrow in the middle of the grid, it cannot escape to the right. However, this is not always true. The robot can still navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements to reach the last column.

2. **Lack of General Pathfinding Logic**:
   - The function does not account for the possibility of the robot navigating through the grid using a series of valid moves to reach the last column. It only checks specific conditions and does not simulate the robot's path.

3. **Example Failures**:
   - The provided examples show that the function fails to correctly identify some cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)`. For instance, in the fourth example, the function incorrectly returns `'No'` when the robot can actually reach `(2, 6)`.

#### Correctness Analysis

Given the issues identified, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
