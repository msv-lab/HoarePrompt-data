You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the movement rules.
   - The function uses a loop to iterate through the first half of the grid (excluding the last column).
   - For each column `i` (from 0 to `half_n - 2`), it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2*i + 1` is `<` and if the arrows in `row2` at positions `2*i` or `2*i + 2` are also `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'` because the robot cannot escape to the right.
   - After the loop, it checks the last column separately.
   - If none of the conditions are met, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2` and calls `func_1` with these values.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where the robot might get stuck due to arrows pointing left.
   - However, the logic only checks for the possibility of getting stuck in the middle of the grid. It does not account for the possibility of the robot reaching the last column via a series of valid moves.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` assumes that if the robot reaches the last column, it will always be able to move to `(2, n)`. This assumption is not entirely correct because the robot must follow the arrows correctly.
   - The function does not handle the case where the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements to reach the last column.

3. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The provided examples show that the function fails to correctly identify some cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - For instance, in the fourth example, the function incorrectly returns `'No'` when the robot can actually reach `(2, 6)`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
