Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by ensuring that every '<' in `row1` has a corresponding '>' in `row2` and vice versa, within certain constraints.
   - It specifically checks if the robot can navigate through the grid without getting stuck or unable to reach the target cell (2, n).
   - The function correctly handles the pairing logic and ensures that the robot can move through the grid as required.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases and processes each one by calling `func_1`.
   - It correctly handles the input reading, calling `func_1` for each test case, and collecting the results.
   - The output format matches the requirements of the problem statement.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) for each test case.
   - The input handling, function calls, and output formatting are all correct according to the problem description.

Given the analysis, the program meets the requirements and constraints of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
