Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical flaw. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle all cases where the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Let's consider a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4
><>>
<<>
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1). It moves right to (1, 2), and then the arrow in (1, 2) points left, so it moves back to (1, 1). From (1, 1), it moves right again to (1, 2), and then it moves left back to (1, 1). This cycle continues, and the robot cannot escape from the first row. Therefore, the robot cannot reach (2, 4).

However, the function `func_1` does not account for this scenario and returns 'Yes' for this input. This means the function does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Thus, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain valid cases where the robot cannot reach the target cell.
