You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, row1 is a string consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', and row2 is a string consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>' representing the first and second rows of the grid respectively. Additionally, n is even.
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
        
    #State: n is unchanged, half_n is n // 2, no value for row1 or row2 provided, no return value from the loop.
    if (row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<') :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: n is unchanged, half_n is n // 2, no value for row1 or row2 provided, and either row1[n - 1] ≠ '<' or row2[n - 2] ≠ '<'
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even), a string `row1` consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', and a string `row2` consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. Based on the given conditions, the function returns 'Yes' if it's possible to pair up all characters in `row1` and `row2` such that each '<' in `row1` is paired with a '>' in `row2` and vice versa, forming valid pairs. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'Yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
