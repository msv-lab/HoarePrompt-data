To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the results of the function `func_2(a)`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(s, m)
   ```

Given this information, we need to understand what `s` and `m` represent after calling `func_2(a)`.

Since the function `func_2(a)` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `s` and `m`. However, we can describe them based on typical naming conventions and common operations performed on lists.

- `s` might represent a sum or a specific aggregation of the elements in the list `a`.
- `m` might represent a maximum or minimum value from the list `a`.

Without more details about `func_2(a)`, we can only describe `s` and `m` in general terms.

Output: **s (the result of func_2(a)), m (the result of func_2(a))**
