Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` (representing minutes since midnight) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It converts the time string `s` to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and outputs it. If the hour is '00', it prints '12'. If the hour is between '01' and '12', it prints the hour as is. If the hour is between '13' and '23', it subtracts 12 from the hour and adds a leading zero. The output also appends either 'AM' or 'PM' based on whether the hour is 12 or greater than '12'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the converted time strings.**
