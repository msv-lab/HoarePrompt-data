### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - For `h = '00'`, it correctly prints `'12'` followed by the minutes.
   - For `h` in the range `01` to `12`, it prints `h` directly followed by the minutes.
   - For `h` in the range `13` to `23`, it correctly converts these hours to the 12-hour format by subtracting `12` and adding a leading zero when necessary (e.g., `13` becomes `01`, `14` becomes `02`, etc.).
3. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - It correctly determines whether to print "AM" or "PM" based on whether `h` is greater than or equal to `12`.
4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the time in the correct format without removing leading zeros and separates the hour and minute part with a colon.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `h` is `'00'` correctly by printing `'12'` instead of `'00'`.

Upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the program logic, there are no apparent issues with the given implementation. The program correctly handles all the conditions mentioned in the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format with the appropriate AM/PM notation.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
