Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes values through a series of test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, and for each test case, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n are integers between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function returns results based on the given test cases.**
