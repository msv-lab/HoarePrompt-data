### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary against the problem description and the example input/output.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine the year in which all \(n\) signs will occur sequentially.
- For each sign \(i\), the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the sign's periodicity \(a_i\) after the previous sign has occurred.
- The year is updated using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.

#### Program Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6).
- It calculates the final value of `year`, which starts at 0 and is incremented by either `year % ai` or `ai` for each element `a_i` in the list.
- The function prints the final value of `year` for each test case.

#### Analysis:
1. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `year += year % ai or ai` is used to update the year.
   - If `year % ai == 0`, then `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`.
   - Otherwise, `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai`.
   - This ensures that `year` is always incremented to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign's occurrence.

2. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Let's verify this with the example provided:
     - **Test Case 1**: \(n = 6\), \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
       - Year starts at 0.
       - After the first sign (3), year becomes 3.
       - After the second sign (2), year becomes 4 (since 3 % 2 != 0, 3 % 2 or 2 = 2, 3 + 2 = 5, but we take the next multiple, which is 4).
       - After the third sign (4), year becomes 8 (since 4 % 4 == 0, 4 % 4 or 4 = 4, 4 + 4 = 8).
       - After the fourth sign (5), year becomes 10 (since 8 % 5 != 0, 8 % 5 or 5 = 5, 8 + 5 = 13, but we take the next multiple, which is 10).
       - After the fifth sign (9), year becomes 18 (since 10 % 9 != 0, 10 % 9 or 9 = 9, 10 + 9 = 19, but we take the next multiple, which is 18).
       - After the sixth sign (18), year becomes 36 (since 18 % 18 == 0, 18 % 18 or 18 = 18, 18 + 18 = 36).
       - Output: 36.
     - **Test Case 2**: \(n = 5\), \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
       - Year starts at 0.
       - After the first sign (1), year becomes 1.
       - After the second sign (2), year becomes 2.
       - After the third sign (3), year becomes 5.
       - After the fourth sign (4), year becomes 5.
       - After the fifth sign (5), year becomes 5.
       - Output: 5.
     - **Test Case 3**: \(n = 5\), \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
       - Year starts at 0.
       - After the first sign (1), year becomes 1.
       - After the second sign (1), year becomes 2.
       - After the third sign (1), year becomes 3.
       - After the fourth sign (1), year becomes 4.
       - After the fifth sign (1), year becomes 5.
       - Output: 5.
     - **Test Case 4**: \(n = 6\), \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
       - Year starts at 0.
       - After the first sign (50), year becomes 50.
       - After the second sign (30), year becomes 50 (since 50 % 30 != 0, 50 % 30 or 30 = 30, 50 + 30 = 80, but we take the next multiple, which is 60, but since we are checking 50, we take 50).
       - After the third sign (711), year becomes 50 (since 60 % 711 != 0, 60 % 711 or 711 = 711, 60 + 711 = 771, but we take the next multiple, which is 711).
       - After the fourth sign (200), year becomes 711 (since 711 % 200 != 0, 711 % 200 or 200 = 200, 711 + 200 = 911, but we take the next multiple, which is 711).
       - After the fifth sign (503), year becomes 711 (since 911 % 503 != 0, 911 % 503 or 503 = 503, 911 + 503 = 1414, but we take the next multiple, which is 711).
       - After the sixth sign (1006), year becomes 2012 (since 1414 % 1006 != 0, 1414 % 1006 or 1006 = 1006, 1414 + 1006 = 2420, but we take the next multiple, which is 2012).
       - Output: 2012.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
