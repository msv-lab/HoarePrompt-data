Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: A variable `year` is initialized to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the current year in which the last sign occurred.

3. **Loop Through Periodicities**: For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program updates `year` by adding `year % ai` or `ai` to `year`. This ensures that `year` is always the next year in which the next sign can occur, considering the previous signs' occurrences.

4. **Output**: After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final value of `year` is printed, representing the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Given the problem requirements and the implementation details, the program correctly computes the year in which the nth sign will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

Correctness: **True**
