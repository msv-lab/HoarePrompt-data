Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range (1 to 1000), the output state reflects this. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
