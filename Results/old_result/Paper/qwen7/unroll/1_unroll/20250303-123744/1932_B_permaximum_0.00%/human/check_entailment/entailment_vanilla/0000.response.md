### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The program needs to find the year when all `n` signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_i`.
3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it updates `year` using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - This formula ensures that `year` is incremented to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign occurred.
4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `year` for each test case.
5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case with periodicities `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the logic correctly calculates the year as 36.
   - For the second test case with periodicities `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the logic correctly calculates the year as 5.
   - For the third test case with all periodicities being 1, the logic correctly calculates the year as 5 (since all signs occur in the same year).
   - For the fourth test case with periodicities `[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`, the logic correctly calculates the year as 2012.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs occur sequentially and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
