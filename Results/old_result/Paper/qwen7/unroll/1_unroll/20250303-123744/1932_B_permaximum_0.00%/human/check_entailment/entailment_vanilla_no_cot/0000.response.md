Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the year in which all \( n \) signs will occur according to the rules described in the problem statement. Here's a brief explanation of why the program works as expected:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \). For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).

2. **Year Calculation**: For each sign, the program calculates the next occurrence year by adding the current year modulo \( a_i \) or simply \( a_i \) if the current year is not a multiple of \( a_i \). This ensures that the tribe waits strictly after the previous sign has occurred.

3. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final year when the last sign occurs.

Given the logic and the example provided, the program accurately computes the year for each test case, making the correctness of the program **True**.
