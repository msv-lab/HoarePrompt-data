Output State: **The program returns the concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by `sym`**

This means the program will take all integers in the list `arr` and concatenate them into a single string, with each integer separated by the string `sym`. Since no specific values for `arr` or `sym` are provided, the output is described in terms of the operation performed on these variables.
