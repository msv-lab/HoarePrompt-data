You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of n constraints where n is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers a and x, where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of `n` constraints where `n` is an integer. Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same. If the `space` condition is true, `items` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input `line` on spaces. Otherwise, `line` is converted into a list of characters, and the `space` condition is false.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers derived from the 'items' list, where each integer is converted from a string representation.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns the number of test cases 't', along with a list of constraints for each test case. Each constraint is represented by two integers 'a' and 'x', where 'a' is either 1, 2, or 3, and 'x' is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `to_int` is a list of strings, the function returns a list of integers derived from those strings. If `to_int` is a dictionary containing the number of test cases 't' and a list of constraints, the function returns the number of test cases 't' along with a list of constraints for each test case, where each constraint is represented by two integers 'a' and 'x', with 'a' being either 1, 2, or 3, and 'x' being an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns a list of integers derived from the 'items' list, where each integer is converted from a string representation.

Case_2: The program returns the number of test cases 't', along with a list of constraints for each test case. Each constraint is represented by two integers 'a' and 'x', where 'a' is either 1, 2, or 3, and 'x' is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
