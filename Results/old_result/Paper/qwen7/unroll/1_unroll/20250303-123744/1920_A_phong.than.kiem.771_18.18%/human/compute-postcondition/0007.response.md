Output State: **The program returns a list of integers derived from the 'items' list, where each integer is converted from a string representation.**

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of `n` constraints, where `n` is an integer.
- Each constraint is represented by two integers `a` and `x`, where `a` is either 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\).
- There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2.
- No two constraints are the same.
- The `to_int` condition is true.

The code snippet `return [int(i) for i in items]` implies that `items` is a list of strings, and the code converts each string in `items` to an integer. Since `to_int` is true, it means that the conversion from string to integer is valid and will not raise any errors.

Therefore, the program returns a list of integers derived from the `items` list, where each integer is the result of converting a string from `items` to an integer.
