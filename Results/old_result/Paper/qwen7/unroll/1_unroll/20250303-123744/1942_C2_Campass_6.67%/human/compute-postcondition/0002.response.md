Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is a specific integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
   - `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.
   - `t` is now equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.

3. **Understand the loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero.

4. **Check the current value of `t`**: Since `t` is a specific integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it is already guaranteed to be non-zero. There is no need to adjust the state of `t`.

5. **Conclusion**: The loop condition `t` is already satisfied because `t` is a non-zero integer. No adjustments are necessary.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive)**
