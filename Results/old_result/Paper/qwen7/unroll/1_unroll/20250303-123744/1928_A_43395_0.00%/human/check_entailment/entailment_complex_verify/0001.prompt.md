You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of 'yes' or 'no' printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. For each test case, if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is equal to `-a` or `-b`, it prints 'no'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the parity of \(a\) and \(b\) and their difference. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is equal to \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value, but the output consists of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine if Bob can transform a given \(a \times b\) rectangle into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they have the same dimensions, regardless of their orientation.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - The given solution checks three main conditions:
     1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'.
     2. If \(a - b\) or \(b - a\) results in a negative value, it prints 'no'.
     3. If \((a - b)\) is odd, it prints 'yes'.
     4. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

3. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, the solution correctly prints 'yes'. This is because an even-sized rectangle can always be cut into two smaller even-sized rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form another rectangle.
   - **Condition 2**: The condition \((a - b == -a, a)\) or \((b - a == -b, b)\) is incorrectly written. It should be checking if \(a - b\) or \(b - a\) is zero, which would mean \(a = b\), and such a rectangle cannot be transformed into another rectangle. However, the current implementation is incorrect and should be simplified to check if \(a = b\).
   - **Condition 3**: The condition \((a - b) \% 2 > 0\) or \((a - b) \% 2 < 0\) is redundant since \((a - b) \% 2 != 0\) covers both cases. This condition should simply check if \(a - b\) is odd, which is correct.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func():
         for _ in range(int(input())):
             a, b = map(int, input().split())
             if a == b:
                 print('no')
             elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
                 print('yes')
             else:
                 print('yes')
     ```

5. **Testing the Given Solution**:
   - The given solution does not handle the case where \(a = b\) correctly and has redundant checks. Therefore, it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases properly and has redundant checks. The correct solution should be simpler and more accurate.

**Correctness: **False**
