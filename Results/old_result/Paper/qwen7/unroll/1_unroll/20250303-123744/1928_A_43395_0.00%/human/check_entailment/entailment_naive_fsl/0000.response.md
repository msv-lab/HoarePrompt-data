Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where both dimensions of the rectangle are odd. According to the problem description, if both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle by cutting and rearranging the pieces. However, the current implementation does not account for this case properly.

For example, consider the test case where \(a = 3\) and \(b = 3\):

- The program checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, which they are not.
- It then checks if \(a - b\) is valid, but since \(a\) and \(b\) are equal and both are odd, this condition is not met.
- Finally, it prints 'no', which is incorrect because from a \(3 \times 3\) rectangle, Bob can indeed form another rectangle by cutting it into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and then rearranging them to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.

To fix this, the program should include a check for the case where both dimensions are odd, and in such cases, it should print 'No'.
