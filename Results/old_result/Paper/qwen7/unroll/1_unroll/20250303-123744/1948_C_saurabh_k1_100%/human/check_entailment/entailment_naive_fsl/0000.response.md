Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions (whether the robot can move from an odd column to an even column or vice versa) and prints 'No' immediately if these conditions are met. However, this approach is incomplete and does not cover all possible valid paths the robot can take.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
4
><>>
<<><
```
In this case, the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4). The provided program would incorrectly output 'No' because it does not account for such a valid sequence of moves. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
