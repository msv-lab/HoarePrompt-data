### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function checks if a given `k` is achievable for a given `n`.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if the maximum possible Manhattan value for `n` is less than `k`.
   - For even `n`, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \( \frac{n^2}{2} \).
   - For odd `n`, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function generates a permutation that meets the required Manhattan value `k` for a given `n`.
   - It starts by halving `k` and then iteratively rearranges elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to work for even `n` and handles the case where `k` is zero by simply returning the identity permutation.
   - For other cases, it shifts elements to the front or back to adjust the Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3` Analysis:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the generated permutation and returns `None`.

4. **Function `func_4` Analysis:**
   - This function orchestrates the overall process.
   - It first calls `func_2` to check if `k` is achievable.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

Given the function summaries and the logic in `func_4`, the program should correctly handle all cases where a permutation with the required Manhattan value exists. Let's verify this by considering different scenarios:

- **Case 1: Even `n` and even `k`:**
  - Example: `n = 4`, `k = 4`
  - `func_2` returns `(4, 4)`.
  - `func_1` can generate a permutation like `[3, 1, 2, 4]` with Manhattan value 4.

- **Case 2: Odd `n` and even `k`:**
  - Example: `n = 5`, `k = 4`
  - `func_2` returns `(5, 4)`.
  - `func_1` can generate a permutation like `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]` with Manhattan value 4.

- **Case 3: Odd `n` and odd `k`:**
  - Example: `n = 5`, `k = 5`
  - `func_2` returns `(0, 0)` because the maximum possible Manhattan value for `n = 5` is 12, which is greater than 5.
  - `func_4` prints "NO".

- **Case 4: Even `n` and odd `k`:**
  - Example: `n = 4`, `k = 5`
  - `func_2` returns `(0, 0)` because the maximum possible Manhattan value for `n = 4` is 8, which is less than 5.
  - `func_4` prints "NO".

From the analysis, the program correctly handles all cases where a permutation with the required Manhattan value exists. The function summaries and the logic in `func_4` ensure that the program behaves as expected.
