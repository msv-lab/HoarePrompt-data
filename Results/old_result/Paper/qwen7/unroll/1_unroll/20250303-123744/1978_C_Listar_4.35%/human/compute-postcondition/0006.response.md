Output State: **`l` is the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)`, and the function `func_3(l)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_3(l)` calls the function `func_3` with the argument `l`. However, since the function `func_3` itself does not modify any global variables and only operates on its input parameter `l`, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The function `func_1(n, k)` was called previously to determine the value of `l`, and now `func_3` is being called with that same value of `l`. Therefore, the state of `n` and `k` remains as they were before, and `l` retains its value from the previous function call.
