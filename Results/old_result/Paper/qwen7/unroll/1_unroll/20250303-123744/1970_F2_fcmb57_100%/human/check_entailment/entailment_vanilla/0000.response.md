### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and goals.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the given movements.
   - It handles the elimination of players when they collide with Bludgers.
   - It correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
   - The logic for scoring points is correctly implemented. When a player scores in the wrong goal, the opposing team gets a point.
   - The program prints the appropriate events (scoring, elimination) in the correct order.

3. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - After processing all actions, the program correctly calculates and prints the final score.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity based on the given direction.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately handles the movement, scoring, and elimination of players based on the given actions. The program processes the input, updates the state of the game, and prints the required output in the specified format.

### Correctness:
**True**
