Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers. This does not affect the value of `t` or any other variables. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and `R` is now defined as the lambda function.
