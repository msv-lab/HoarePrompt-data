Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. It correctly extracts the values of `na_frente` (n) and `pos_final` (m) for each test case.
3. It initializes the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` with the respective costs from the input.
4. It adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` to be zero-indexed.
5. The main logic of the program is implemented in the for loop, which iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
6. Inside the loop, it checks if the current position `v` is within the desired final position `pos_final`.
   - If `v` is within the desired final position, it updates `best` and `total` based on the minimum cost between swapping and passing.
   - If `v` is beyond the desired final position, it only adds the cost of passing to `total`.
7. The loop correctly accumulates the minimum cost required to ensure Kirill's position is within the desired limit.
8. Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
