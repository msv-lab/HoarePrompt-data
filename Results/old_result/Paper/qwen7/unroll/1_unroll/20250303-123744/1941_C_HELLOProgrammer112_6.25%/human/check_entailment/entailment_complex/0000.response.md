Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string and prints their sum. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters to remove to make the string beautiful, not just count the occurrences of "map" and "pie".

For example, consider the input "mmapnapie". The program would output 3 because it counts "map" and "pie" separately, but the correct answer should be 2, as removing the 4th and 9th characters makes the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program does not address the requirement to minimize the number of deletions to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
