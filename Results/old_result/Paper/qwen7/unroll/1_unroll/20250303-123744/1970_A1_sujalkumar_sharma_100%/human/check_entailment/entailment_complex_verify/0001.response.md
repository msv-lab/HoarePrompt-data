### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - It then initializes the length of the string `s` and creates an empty list `prefix_balance` to store the balance, position, and character for each position in the string.

2. **Calculating Prefix Balance:**
   - The program iterates through each character in the string `s`, updating the balance and storing the balance, position, and character in the `prefix_balance` list.
   - This step correctly calculates the prefix balance for each position in the string.

3. **Sorting the `prefix_balance` List:**
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted based on the prefix balance in ascending order. In case of a tie, it sorts by position in descending order.
   - This step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Constructing the Result:**
   - The program constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence by concatenating the characters from the sorted `prefix_balance` list.
   - This step correctly reconstructs the balanced shuffle sequence based on the sorted order.

5. **Function and Main Program:**
   - The `func_1` function encapsulates the logic for calculating the balanced shuffle, and the main program calls this function and prints the result.
   - The overall structure and flow of the program align with the problem description and the expected behavior.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the program. The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
