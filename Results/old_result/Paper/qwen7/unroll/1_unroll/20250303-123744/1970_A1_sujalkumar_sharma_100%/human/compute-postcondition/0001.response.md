Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `prefix_balance = []` creates an empty list named `prefix_balance`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the initial state of `s` and `n` remains unchanged, and `prefix_balance` is now an empty list.
