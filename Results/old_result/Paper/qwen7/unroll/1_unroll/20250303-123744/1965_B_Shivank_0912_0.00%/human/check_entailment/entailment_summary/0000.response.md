Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by generating a fixed sequence of 25 elements, where each element is a power of 2. This sequence is then used for every test case, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Let's analyze whether this approach meets the problem requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The sequence `[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^24]` is a set of distinct powers of 2.
   - Any subset of these elements will have a sum that is also a distinct sum of powers of 2.
   - Since `k` is a specific integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` can be very large, the probability that `k` itself can be represented as a sum of these powers of 2 is very low. Therefore, no subsequence will sum to `k`.

2. **Subsequence Summing to All Other Values Between 1 and `n`:**
   - Given that the sequence contains distinct powers of 2, any integer can be represented as a sum of these powers of 2 (this is the basis of binary representation).
   - However, since `k` is excluded from being representable as a sum, the remaining values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can indeed be represented using the sequence.

Based on the above points, the approach is theoretically sound and should work for any valid input within the constraints. The fixed sequence `[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^24]` ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be represented as a sum of the sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
