Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate sequences that meet the specified conditions for each test case. Specifically:

1. **Sequence Generation**: The `func_1` function generates a fixed sequence of length 25 consisting of powers of 2 (`[2 ** i for i in range(25)]`). This sequence will always have a subsequence that sums to any value up to \(2^{25} - 1\), which means it will include subsequences that sum to values greater than `n`, violating the condition that only values from 1 to `n` should be achievable.

2. **Condition Violation**: The generated sequence will always have subsequences that sum to values beyond `n`, thus failing to satisfy the requirement that no subsequence should sum to `k` while still allowing all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) to be represented as a subsequence sum.

To fix this, you would need to generate a sequence that meets the specific requirements for each test case individually, rather than using a fixed sequence.
