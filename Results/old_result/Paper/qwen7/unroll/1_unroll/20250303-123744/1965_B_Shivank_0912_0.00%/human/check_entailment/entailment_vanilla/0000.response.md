### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the pairs of integers (`n` and `k`) for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequences**: The function `func_1` generates a fixed sequence of length 25, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`). This sequence is used for every test case.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: Since the sequence consists of powers of 2, no subsequence can sum to an odd number like `k` (assuming `k` is odd). For even `k`, the sequence does not contain enough elements to form `k` as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**: Given the nature of powers of 2, any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Therefore, the sequence can form all sums from 1 to `n-1` (since `k` is excluded).

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the length of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly generates a sequence of length 25 that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
