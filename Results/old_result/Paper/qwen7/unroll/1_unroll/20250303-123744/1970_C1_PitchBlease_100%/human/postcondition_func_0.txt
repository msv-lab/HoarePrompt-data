The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (representing the tree's edges), and `start` (the starting node for a round). It constructs a bidirectional tree representation using the given edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf. Based on whether these distances are odd or even, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
