start is an integer representing the starting node, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. Both start and target are within the range 1 to n (inclusive), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The tree is represented as an adjacency list named `tree`, which is a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighbors.
