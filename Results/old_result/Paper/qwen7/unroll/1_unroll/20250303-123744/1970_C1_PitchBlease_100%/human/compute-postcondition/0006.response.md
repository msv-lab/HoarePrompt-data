Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all edges from `edges` added bidirectionally; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` calculated using BFS; `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` calculated using BFS.**

Explanation: The code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the distance from the `start` node to the second leaf node (`leaves[1]`) using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This distance is stored in the variable `dist2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
