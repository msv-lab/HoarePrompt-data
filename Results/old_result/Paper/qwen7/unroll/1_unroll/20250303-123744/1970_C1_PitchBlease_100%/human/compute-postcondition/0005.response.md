Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all edges from `edges` added bidirectionally; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` calculated using BFS.**

In this output state, the `tree` and `leaves` variables retain their initial values. The variable `dist1` has been assigned the result of the BFS (Breadth-First Search) algorithm run from `start` to `leaves[0]`.
