Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all edges from `edges` added bidirectionally; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node.**

Explanation: The code creates a list called `leaves` which contains all the nodes in the tree that have exactly one adjacent node (i.e., leaf nodes). The values of `tree`, `n`, and `start` remain unchanged.
