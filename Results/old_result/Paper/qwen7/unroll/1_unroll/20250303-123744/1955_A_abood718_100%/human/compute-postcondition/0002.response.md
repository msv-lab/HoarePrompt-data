Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each representing the result of one iteration of the loop based on the input values for A, B, and C. For each test case (i), if \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, the output will be \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input value.
