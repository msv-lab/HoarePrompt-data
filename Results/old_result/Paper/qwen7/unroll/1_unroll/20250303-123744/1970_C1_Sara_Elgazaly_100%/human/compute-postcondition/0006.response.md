Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges for each node based on user inputs, `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing reverse edges for each node based on user inputs, `z` is an integer input from the third split, `tmp` is equal to `z`.**

The code assigns the value of `z` to the variable `tmp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
