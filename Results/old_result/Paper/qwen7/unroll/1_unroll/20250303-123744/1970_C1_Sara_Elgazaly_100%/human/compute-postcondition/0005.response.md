Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing edges for each node based on user inputs, `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists containing reverse edges for each node based on user inputs, `z` is an integer input from the third split.**

In this output state, the variable `z` has been updated to hold the integer value input from the third split, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
