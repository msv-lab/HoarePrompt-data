### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the frequency of any single number in an array after adding a permutation to it. The key insight is that we can shift each element by a value such that the frequency of the most common number is maximized.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses `func_1` to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` using `func_1`.
   - It reads the array elements using `func_3`, which should return a list of integers.
   - The code then calculates the maximum value in the array (`m`).
   - It creates a new array `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - The array `new` is sorted.
   - It then iterates through the sorted array `new` and adds valid indices to a set `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Step 1**: Reading the number of test cases and the size of each array is correct.
   - **Step 2**: Reading the array elements using `func_3` is correct.
   - **Step 3**: Calculating the maximum value `m` is correct.
   - **Step 4**: Creating the new array `new` by subtracting each element from `m` and adding 1 is correct. This step ensures that the new array values are adjusted to reflect possible shifts.
   - **Step 5**: Sorting the new array is unnecessary and incorrect. The logic should directly count the valid indices without sorting.
   - **Step 6**: Adding valid indices to a set `ans` is correct, but the logic for determining valid indices needs to be reconsidered.

4. **Revised Logic**:
   - Instead of sorting, we should directly count the valid indices where the shifted value is between 1 and `n`.
   - The correct approach is to iterate through the new array and count the valid indices.

### Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(func_1()):
    n = func_1()
    arr = func_3()
    m = max(arr)
    new = [m - x + 1 for x in arr]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i in new:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code is almost correct but needs minor adjustments. Specifically, sorting the array `new` is unnecessary, and counting the valid indices directly is more efficient.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
