Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions do not implement the required functionality. The problem requires implementing a function to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. However, none of the provided functions attempt to solve this problem. Instead, they seem to be utility functions for various operations like reading input, sorting, and manipulating arrays, which are not relevant to solving the given problem.

To solve the problem, we would need to:
1. Read the input array.
2. Generate all possible permutations of the indices.
3. Apply each permutation to the array.
4. Count the frequency of each element in the modified array.
5. Determine the maximum frequency.

Since the provided functions do not address any of these steps, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
