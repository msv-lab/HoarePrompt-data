t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, followed by a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n representing the elements of the array a. The values of t, n, and a_i satisfy the constraints provided in the problem description.
