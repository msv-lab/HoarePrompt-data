### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array `a` after adding a permutation to the array. This means we need to find a permutation such that the frequency of the most common number in the modified array is maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that by choosing a suitable permutation, we can make the elements of the array as close as possible to each other. If the array already has a large number of identical elements, we can keep them the same. Otherwise, we can try to group similar elements together.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. Instead, it contains various utility functions for input processing and arithmetic operations.
   - The main logic is implemented in the loop that iterates over the test cases. For each test case, it reads the array, finds the maximum element, and then constructs a new array where each element is transformed to be as close as possible to the maximum element by subtracting the current element from the maximum element and adding 1.
   - The new array is then sorted, and the unique elements are counted to find the maximum frequency.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_3()`: Reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array elements.
   - The main loop iterates over each test case:
     - `n = func_1()`: Reads the size of the array.
     - `arr = func_3()`: Reads the array elements.
     - `m = max(arr)`: Finds the maximum element in the array.
     - `new = []`: Initializes a new list to store transformed elements.
     - `for i in range(n): new.append(m - arr[i] + 1)`: Transforms each element to be as close as possible to the maximum element.
     - `new.sort()`: Sorts the new array.
     - `ans = set()`: Initializes a set to count unique elements.
     - `for i in new: if i <= n and i > 0: ans.add(i)`: Adds the transformed elements to the set if they are within the valid range.
     - `print(len(ans))`: Prints the size of the set, which represents the maximum frequency of any element in the transformed array.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in the main loop correctly transforms the array elements to be as close as possible to the maximum element.
   - Sorting the transformed array and counting unique elements ensures that we get the maximum frequency of any element.
   - The code handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It transforms the array elements to maximize the frequency of the most common element and prints the result accurately.
