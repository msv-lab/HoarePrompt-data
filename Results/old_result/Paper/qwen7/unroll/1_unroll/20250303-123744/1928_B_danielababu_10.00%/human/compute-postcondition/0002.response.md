Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `i`, which is being initialized and updated within the loop.

2. **Understand the loop initialization and condition**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration (`-1`).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The variable `i` needs to be set to the starting value, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The variable `i` must remain within the bounds of the list `arr` (i.e., `i` should be greater than or equal to 0) for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `arr`: This is a list of positive integers, but its state does not directly affect the loop execution based on the provided information.
   - `ans`: This is an empty list, and its state does not affect the loop execution based on the provided information.
   - `tem`: This is set to 1, and its state does not directly affect the loop execution based on the provided information.

Given these points, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `arr`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` is a list of positive integers**.

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `arr` is a list of positive integers**.
