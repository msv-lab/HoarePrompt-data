### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation to the array. A permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) can be used to rearrange the elements of the array \( a \) according to the rule \( a_i := a_i + p_i \).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the frequency of any number in the array, we can use the permutation to make all elements equal to the most frequent number in the original array plus the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array. This way, we can ensure that the most frequent number becomes the most frequent number in the transformed array.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - **func_3()**: Reads the size of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - For each test case, the code reads \( n \) and the array \( a \).
     - It finds the maximum value \( m \) in the array.
     - It creates a new array `new` where each element is calculated as \( m - a[i] + 1 \).
     - It sorts the `new` array.
     - It iterates through the sorted `new` array to find the maximum possible frequency of any number in the transformed array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the main loop is flawed. The goal is to maximize the frequency of any number in the array, not just count unique numbers.
   - The approach of creating a new array `new` and sorting it does not correctly solve the problem. Instead, the correct approach would involve using the permutation to make all elements equal to the most frequent number plus the appropriate offset.
   - The current implementation does not account for the fact that the permutation can be used to make all elements equal to the most frequent number, thus maximizing its frequency.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**
