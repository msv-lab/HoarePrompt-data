Output State: The output state depends on the value of `a`. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`), the program reads multiple strings from input. If the first two strings contain the digit '1' the same number of times, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This process repeats `a` times, and the final output is the sequence of 'SQUARE' and 'TRIANGLE' printed during these iterations.
