### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input.

2. **Counting Ones**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of ones in each row.
   - However, this approach does not correctly identify the shapes. For example, a triangle or a square might have different counts of ones in different rows.

3. **Shape Identification**:
   - The logic to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is flawed.
     - For a square, all rows should have the same number of ones, spaced equally from the left edge.
     - For a triangle, the counts of ones should follow a specific pattern (2*i-1 for the i-th row).
   - The current logic only checks if the first two rows have the same number of ones, which is insufficient for identifying the shapes accurately.

4. **Output**:
   - If the counts of ones in the first two rows are the same, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".
   - This simplistic check will fail for many test cases, especially for triangles and upside-down triangles.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem description.
