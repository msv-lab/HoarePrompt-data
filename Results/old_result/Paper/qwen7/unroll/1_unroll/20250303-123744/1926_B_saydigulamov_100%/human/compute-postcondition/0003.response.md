Output State: The output state depends on the values of `t` and `a`. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `a`), the program reads multiple strings from input. If the first two strings contain the same number of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This process repeats `a` times, and the final output is the sequence of 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' printed during these iterations.
