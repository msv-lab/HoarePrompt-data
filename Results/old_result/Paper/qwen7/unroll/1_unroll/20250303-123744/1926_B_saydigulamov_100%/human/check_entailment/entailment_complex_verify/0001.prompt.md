You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters which are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the values of `t` and `a`. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `a`), the program reads multiple strings from input. If the first two strings contain the same number of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This process repeats `a` times, and the final output is the sequence of 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' printed during these iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented as a list of n strings containing '0's and '1's. For each test case, it checks if the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's. If the first two strings in the grid contain the same number of '1's, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'. This process repeats for each test case specified by the user, and the final output is a sequence of 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' based on the grid analysis for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input.

2. **Counting Ones**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of ones in each row.
   - However, this approach does not correctly identify the shapes. For example, a triangle or a square might have different counts of ones in different rows.

3. **Shape Identification**:
   - The logic to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is flawed.
     - For a square, all rows should have the same number of ones, spaced equally from the left edge.
     - For a triangle, the counts of ones should follow a specific pattern (2*i-1 for the i-th row).
   - The current logic only checks if the first two rows have the same number of ones, which is insufficient for identifying the shapes accurately.

4. **Output**:
   - If the counts of ones in the first two rows are the same, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".
   - This simplistic check will fail for many test cases, especially for triangles and upside-down triangles.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem description.
