The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of all elements in `arr` up to that index. Initially, a variable `tem` is set to 1 and multiplied by each element in `arr` during a loop, with the result appended to `ans`. After processing all elements in `arr`, `ans` contains the desired cumulative products.
