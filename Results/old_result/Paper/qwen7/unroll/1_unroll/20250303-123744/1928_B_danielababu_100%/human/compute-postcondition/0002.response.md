Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the expression `len(arr) - 1, -1, -1`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by `1` each time.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: At the start of the loop, `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`.

4. **Check the other variables**:
   - `arr`: This is a list of positive integers, but no adjustments are needed as it is used within the loop body.
   - `ans`: This is an empty list, and its state doesn't affect the loop execution directly.
   - `tem`: This variable is initially set to `1`, and it is not used in the loop head or the loop condition.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `arr` is a list of positive integers, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**
