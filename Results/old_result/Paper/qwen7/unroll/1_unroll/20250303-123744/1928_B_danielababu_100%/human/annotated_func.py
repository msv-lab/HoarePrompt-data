#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer input from the user representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an additional integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function then returns the initial integer input provided by the user, which indicates the total number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, representing the length of the array a; the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
