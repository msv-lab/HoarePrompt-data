Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for each test case.**

This means that for each test case description in the `test_cases` list, the program has executed an inner loop which likely modifies the `current_year` value, and the final value of `current_year` for each test case is stored in the `results` list. The `return results` statement returns this list of final year values.
