Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). It processes each test case by iterating over the list of integers and updating a variable `current_year` based on certain conditions. After processing all test cases, it returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` for each test case.**
