Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes a list to store the results.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
3. The function `func_1` iterates through each periodicity in the list `a` and calculates the next year in which the sign will occur based on the current year and the periodicity.
4. The logic used to calculate the next year is correct. If the current year is divisible by the periodicity, the next year is simply the current year plus the periodicity. Otherwise, it calculates the next multiple of the periodicity that comes after the current year.
5. The function updates `current_year` correctly for each periodicity and appends the final `current_year` to the results list.
6. Finally, the function returns the list of results, which is the correct output format.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and the steps taken to solve the problem are correct.

Correctness: **True**
