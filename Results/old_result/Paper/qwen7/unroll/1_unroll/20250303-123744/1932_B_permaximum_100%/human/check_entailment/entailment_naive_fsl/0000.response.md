Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function to determine the next year is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 3 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs every 2 years, so it will occur in years 2, 4, 6, etc.
  - The second sign occurs every 3 years, so it will occur in years 3, 6, 9, etc.
  - The third sign occurs every 6 years, so it will occur in years 6, 12, 18, etc.
  - The first sign occurs in year 2, so the tribe waits for the second sign starting from year 3. The second sign will occur in year 6, so the tribe waits for the third sign starting from year 7. The third sign will occur in year 12, so the output should be 12.

However, the program calculates the next year incorrectly. For example, when the first sign occurs in year 2, the program calculates the next year for the second sign as 6, but it should start from year 3. This leads to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs, ensuring that the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous sign.
