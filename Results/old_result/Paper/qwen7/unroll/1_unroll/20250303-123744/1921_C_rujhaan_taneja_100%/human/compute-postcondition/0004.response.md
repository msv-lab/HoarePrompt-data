Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n, f, a, and b (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9), and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}). For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a sequence of integers. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function processes these inputs and produces a result for each test case.
