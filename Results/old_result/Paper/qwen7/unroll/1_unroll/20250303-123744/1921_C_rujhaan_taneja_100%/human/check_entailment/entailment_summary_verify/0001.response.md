### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires determining if Stepan can send all messages within the given constraints of charge and energy usage.
   - The key points are:
     - Initial charge `f`.
     - Charge loss rate `a` per unit of time.
     - Energy cost `b` for turning the phone off and on.
     - Messages must be sent at specific times `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`.

2. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The phone starts with `f` units of charge.
   - The phone loses `a` units of charge per unit of time.
   - Turning off and on the phone consumes `b` units of energy.
   - The goal is to ensure the phone has enough charge to send all messages without dropping to zero or below.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It correctly extracts `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the first line of each test case.
   - It also correctly extracts the list of message times.
   - However, the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages is flawed:
     - The code calculates the charge used between consecutive messages (`arr[i] - arr[i-1] * a`) but does not account for the energy cost of turning the phone off and on.
     - The code only considers the charge used between messages and the energy cost of turning the phone off and on, but it does not correctly accumulate these costs.
     - The condition `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:` is incorrect because it does not properly account for the total charge required to send all messages considering both charge loss and energy consumption for turning the phone off and on.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the total charge lost due to sending messages.
   - Calculate the total energy cost of turning the phone off and on.
   - Ensure the sum of these costs does not exceed the initial charge `f`.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples show that the current implementation fails to correctly handle the energy cost of turning the phone off and on.
   - For instance, in the third test case, the code incorrectly determines that it is possible to send all messages, but the correct approach would involve calculating the total charge and energy costs more accurately.

6. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and a list of `n` integers.
   - It creates a new list `array2` based on certain conditions involving the input arrays.
   - It then checks if the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements with `b` is less than `f`.
   - The function does not return any value but prints "Yes" or "No" for each test case.

7. **Corrected Implementation**:
   - The corrected implementation should:
     - Calculate the total charge lost due to sending messages.
     - Calculate the total energy cost of turning the phone off and on.
     - Ensure the sum of these costs does not exceed the initial charge `f`.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided code does not correctly account for the total charge and energy costs involved in sending all messages.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
