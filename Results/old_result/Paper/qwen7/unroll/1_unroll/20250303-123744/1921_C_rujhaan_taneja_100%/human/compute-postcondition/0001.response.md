Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `test_cases`**: According to the problem, `test_cases` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `test_cases` is an integer input from the user.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(test_cases)` will execute as long as `test_cases` is greater than 0. If `test_cases` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on `test_cases` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is set to a positive integer. Given that `test_cases` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, we can safely assume that it will be a positive integer.

5. **Adjust the State of `i`**: The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

- `test_cases` must be a positive integer (since it is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, it will always be a positive integer).
- `i` must be 0.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`test_cases` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**.
