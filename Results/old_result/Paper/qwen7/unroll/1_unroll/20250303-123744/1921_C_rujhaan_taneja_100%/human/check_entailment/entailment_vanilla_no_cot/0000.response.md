Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Charge Consumption**: The program incorrectly calculates the charge consumption for turning the phone on and off. Specifically, it assumes that the phone must be turned off and on between every two consecutive messages, which is not always necessary. The logic should consider whether turning off and on is beneficial or not based on the remaining charge and the time interval between messages.

2. **Incorrect Summation and Comparison**: The program sums up the charge used for sending messages and turning the phone on and off, but it doesn't correctly account for the optimal strategy of when to turn the phone off and on. It simply adds the charge used for turning the phone on and off for every message, which is overly simplistic and might lead to incorrect results.

3. **Logic Flaw in Determining Whether to Turn Off and On**: The program checks if the time difference between messages is less than `b/a` to decide whether to turn the phone off and on, but this logic is flawed. The decision to turn off and on should be based on the remaining charge and the total charge needed to send all messages.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, one should simulate the process of sending messages and turning the phone on and off optimally. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Calculate Total Time to Send All Messages**: Compute the total time required to send all messages.
2. **Simulate Charging and Discharging**: Simulate the process of sending messages and turning the phone on and off to minimize the total charge used.
3. **Check if Total Charge Used is Within Limit**: Verify if the total charge used is within the initial charge limit.

Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[feat.index('b') + 1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]

        # Calculate total time to send all messages
        total_time = arr[-1]

        # Calculate minimum charge needed if no turning off and on
        min_charge_needed = total_time * a

        # Calculate charge used if turning off and on optimally
        charge_used = f
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if arr[i + 1] - arr[i] <= b / a:
                charge_used += b
            else:
                charge_used += (arr[i + 1] - arr[i]) * a

        # Check if we can send all messages with the available charge
        if charge_used <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

```

This corrected version should handle the problem correctly by simulating the optimal strategy for turning the phone on and off.
