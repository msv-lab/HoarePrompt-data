Output State: The output state consists of "Yes" or "No" printed for each test case based on the conditions inside the loop. For each test case, a list `array2` is created where elements are appended based on certain conditions involving the input arrays `arr`. If the sum of the elements in `array2` plus the product of the remaining elements with `b` is less than `f`, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".
