You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \(n\), \(k\), and \(m\), and a string \(s\) of length \(m\) consisting of the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. It checks if there are at least \(n\) substrings of length \(k\) within \(s\) that contain only characters from the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. If such substrings are found, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it determines and prints a specific character sequence based on the remaining characters needed to meet the condition.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to verify if every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occurs as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide an example of such a string.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle one test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by the string `s`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It uses a set `win` to keep track of the characters encountered in the current window of size `n`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates `win` when a character in `s` matches one in `us`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the entire string, it checks if `ps` (the count of complete windows) is at least `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where all possible strings of length `n` are present in `s` as subsequences.
   - The logic also correctly identifies when a string of length `n` is missing and provides an example.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If all possible strings of length `n` are found, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and provides an example of a missing string.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`2 2 4` with `s = "abba"`), the output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences.
   - For the second test case (`2 2 3` with `s = "abb"`), the output is "NO" and an example is "aa" because "aa" is not a subsequence.
   - For the third test case (`3 3 10` with `s = "aabbccabab"`), the output is "NO" and an example is "ccc" because "ccc" is not a subsequence.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.
