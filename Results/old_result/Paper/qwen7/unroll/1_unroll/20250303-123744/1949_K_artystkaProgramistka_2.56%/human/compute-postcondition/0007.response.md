Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c, where group_a contains the first na elements from numbers, group_b contains the next nb elements from numbers, and group_c contains the last nc elements from numbers.**

This output state describes that the program returns a tuple containing the string `'YES'` and three lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists are derived from the initial list `numbers` based on the counts `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, which represent the number of elements in each segment of the list.
