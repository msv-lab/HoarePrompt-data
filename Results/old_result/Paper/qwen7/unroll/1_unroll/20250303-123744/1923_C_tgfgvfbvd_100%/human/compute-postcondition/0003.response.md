Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list `c` of length `n`, along with `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i`. For each query, it returns the sum of elements in the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` inclusive.**

This means the function is designed to take a list of positive integers `c` and a number of queries `q`. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function calculates and returns the sum of the elements within that specified range.
