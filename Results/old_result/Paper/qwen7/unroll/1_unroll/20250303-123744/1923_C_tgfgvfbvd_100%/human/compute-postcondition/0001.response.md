Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each query based on the conditions given in the loop. For each query defined by \(a\) and \(b\), if the number of 1s in the subarray \(l[a-1]\) to \(l[b]\) is less than or equal to half the length of the subarray minus one, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
