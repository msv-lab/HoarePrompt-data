Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases (t) and their respective integers (n). For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, it processes these values and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is expected to handle multiple test cases where each case includes an integer `t` representing the number of subsequent integers `n` to process. The function will validate `t` to ensure it is within the range 1 to 10^4, and for each of the `t` cases, it will validate `n` to ensure it is within the range 1 to 10^9, then perform some operation or return a specific value based on these integers.
