The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case involves an integer \( n \) (such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \)). For each \( n \), if \( n = 1 \), it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( n \). The function implicitly accepts the number of test cases as input and does not return any value, instead printing the results for each test case.
