Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tc`). This integer is converted to an integer type and assigned to the variable `tc`. No other variables are affected by this code, so their initial states remain unchanged.
