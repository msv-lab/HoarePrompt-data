Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then creates a list of characters by looking up values in a predefined alphabet list based on the count of each element in the reversed list from its position to the end. Finally, it prints the resulting list of characters as a string.**
