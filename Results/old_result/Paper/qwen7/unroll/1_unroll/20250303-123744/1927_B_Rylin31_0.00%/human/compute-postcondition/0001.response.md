Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; the trace is a list of n integers a_i where 0 ≤ a_i < n; after executing the loop, ans is a list of characters formed by looking up characters in the alphabet based on the count of each element in the reversed array from its position to the end of the array.
