The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string. In the returned string, each character from the input string is replaced by the character at the mirrored index as defined in a dictionary `mapping`. The dictionary `mapping` is created by sorting the unique characters in `encoded` and then pairing each character with its mirrored counterpart in the sorted list.
