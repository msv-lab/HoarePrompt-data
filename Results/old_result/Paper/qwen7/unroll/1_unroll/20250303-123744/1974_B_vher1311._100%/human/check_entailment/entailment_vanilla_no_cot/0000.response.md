Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string but actually encodes it instead. This is because the function `func_1` is designed to encode a string according to the given rules, not decode it. To decode, we need to reverse the process: first construct the string `r` from the unique characters of the encoded string `b`, then map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r` from the end to the beginning. Here's how you can modify the program to correctly decode the string:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    # Create the auxiliary string r with unique characters sorted alphabetically
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    # Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {char: r[-(i + 1)] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    # Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
```

This corrected version should properly decode the encoded strings.
