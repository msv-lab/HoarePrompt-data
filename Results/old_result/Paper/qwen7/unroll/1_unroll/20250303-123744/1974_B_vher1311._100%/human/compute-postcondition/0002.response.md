Output State: **The program returns a string where each character in the input string 'encoded' is replaced by the character at the mirrored index as defined in the dictionary 'mapping'.**

This means that for each character in the string `encoded`, the program looks up the corresponding character in the dictionary `mapping` and constructs a new string by joining these characters together. The dictionary `mapping` pairs each character in the string `r` with its mirrored counterpart in `r`.
