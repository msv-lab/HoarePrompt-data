Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Step 1**: It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by taking all distinct characters from the encoded string and sorting them alphabetically.
   - **Step 2**: It creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is paired with its corresponding mirrored character (from the end of `r`).
   - **Step 3**: It decodes the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mirrored counterpart from the `mapping` dictionary.

3. **Output**: The decoded strings for each test case are collected and printed.

Given that the logic in the `func_1` function matches the problem description and the steps outlined, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
