Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and its length as parameters. It iterates through the list (excluding the first and last elements) and reduces certain elements based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if all elements in the list are less than or equal to 18. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list is such that elements that were initially greater than 1 and had neighbors greater than 0 have been reduced according to specified rules, while other elements remain unchanged.**
