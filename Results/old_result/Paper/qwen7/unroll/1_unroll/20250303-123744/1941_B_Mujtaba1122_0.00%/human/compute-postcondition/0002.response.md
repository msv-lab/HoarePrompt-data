Output State: The list will be such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was greater than 1 initially and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by its own value, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.
