Reasoning:
1. The annotated program describes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but the logic within `func_2` directly manipulates the list and checks if all elements are zero after performing operations. This means `func_1` is not actually used in the main logic of the program.
2. `func_2` iterates through the list and applies the specified operation as long as the conditions are met (i.e., `list[i] > 1` and `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`). This operation effectively reduces the value of `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, and adjusts `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` accordingly.
3. After applying the operation as many times as possible, `func_2` calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
4. The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the problem's requirements and accurately determines whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
5. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the program based on the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
