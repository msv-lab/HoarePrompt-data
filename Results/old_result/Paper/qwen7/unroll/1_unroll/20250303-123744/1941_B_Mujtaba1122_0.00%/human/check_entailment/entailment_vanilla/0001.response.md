### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations involve choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 3.
   - To make all elements zero, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 3.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to perform the operations to reduce the array elements to zero.
     - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
     - For each element `a[i]` greater than 1, it ensures that `a[i-1]` is also greater than 0 and `a[i+1]` is greater than 0 before performing the operation.
     - The operation reduces `a[i-1]` by `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` by `2 * a[i-1]`, and `a[i+1]` by `a[i-1]`.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies the operations to reduce the array elements.
   - However, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' without returning a value, which is not suitable for a function intended to be part of a larger program.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The main function should call `func_2` for each test case and check if `func_1` returns `True`.
   - Since `func_2` is designed to modify the array in place and print the result, it is not ideal for a main function that needs to return a value.

6. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The program does not return a value but prints 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - This makes it unsuitable for a function that should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to make all elements zero.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirement of returning a boolean value. Instead, it prints the result directly. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
