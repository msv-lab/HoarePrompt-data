Postcondition: **The list will be such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was not greater than 1 initially or either `list[i-1]` or `list[i+1]` was not greater than 0, then `list[i]` will remain unchanged, `list[i-1]` will remain unchanged, and `list[i+1]` will remain unchanged. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.**
