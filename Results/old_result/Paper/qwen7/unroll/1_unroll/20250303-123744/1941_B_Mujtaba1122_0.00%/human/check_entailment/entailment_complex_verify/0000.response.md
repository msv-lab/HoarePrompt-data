### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
- If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array according to the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation if the conditions are met.
- The conditions for applying the operation are:
  - `list[i] > 1`
  - `list[i - 1] > 0`
  - `list[i + 1] > 0`

If the conditions are met, the operation is applied:
- `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` (which simplifies to `list[i - 1] -= list[i - 1]`)
- `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
- `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`

After applying the operation, the function calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Analysis:
1. **Operation Effectiveness**: 
   - The operation reduces `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i - 1]`, `list[i - 1]` by its own value, and `list[i + 1]` by the value of `list[i - 1]`.
   - This means that the operation effectively reduces three elements in the array by specific amounts.
   - The operation ensures that if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i - 1]` and `list[i + 1]` are greater than 0, the elements can be reduced further.

2. **Reduction Process**:
   - The function `func_2` repeatedly applies the operation until no more reductions can be made.
   - This ensures that all elements that can be reduced are reduced to the extent possible.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After all possible reductions, `func_1` is called to check if all elements are zero.
   - If all elements are zero, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.

Given the analysis, the function `func_2` correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros. The original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not handle the reduction process correctly. In fact, the function does handle the reduction process as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations.

**Final: True**
