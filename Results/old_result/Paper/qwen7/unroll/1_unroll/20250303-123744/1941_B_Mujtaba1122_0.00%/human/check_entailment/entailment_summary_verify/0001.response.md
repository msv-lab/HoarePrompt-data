### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations involve choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 3.
   - To make all elements zero, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 3.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to perform the operations to reduce the array elements to zero.
     - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
     - For each element `a[i]` greater than 1, it ensures that `a[i-1]` is also greater than 0 and `a[i+1]` is greater than 0 before performing the operation.
     - The operation reduces `a[i-1]` by `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` by `2 * a[i-1]`, and `a[i+1]` by `a[i-1]`.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies the operations to reduce the array elements.
   - However, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' without returning a value, which is not suitable for a function intended to be part of a larger program.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The main function should call `func_2` for each test case and check if `func_1` returns `True`.
   - Since `func_2` is designed to modify the array in place and print the result, it is not ideal for a main function that needs to return a value.

6. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The program does not return a value but prints 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - This makes it unsuitable for a function that should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to make all elements zero.

7. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that `func_2` iterates through the array and reduces certain elements based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if all elements in the list are less than or equal to 18. However, the key point is that the function should ensure that all elements become zero, not just less than or equal to 18.
   - The function summary mentions that the final state of the list is such that elements that were initially greater than 1 and had neighbors greater than 0 have been reduced according to specified rules, while other elements remain unchanged. This is not entirely accurate because the function should ensure that all elements become zero, not just reduce them according to the specified rules.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirement of returning a boolean value. Instead, it prints the result directly. Additionally, the function summary is misleading because it does not accurately describe the condition for making all elements zero.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
