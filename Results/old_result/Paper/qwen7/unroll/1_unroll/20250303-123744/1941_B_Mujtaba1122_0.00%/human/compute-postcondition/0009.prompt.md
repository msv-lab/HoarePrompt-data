You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a` of length `n`, where `3 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5` and `0 <= a_j \le 10^9`.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: The list will be such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was greater than 1 initially and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by its own value, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: For every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by its own value, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. If these conditions are not met, `list[i]`, `list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` will remain unchanged. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `list`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which represents the length of the list. The function returns "minor" if all elements in the list are less than or equal to 18; otherwise, it returns "adult".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
