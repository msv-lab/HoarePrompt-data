Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which represents the length of the list. The function returns "minor" if all elements in the list are less than or equal to 18; otherwise, it returns "adult".**

This means the function checks if all integers in the given list are minors (less than or equal to 18). If any integer in the list is 19 or greater, the function concludes that at least one element is an adult and returns "adult". If all elements are minors, it returns "minor".
