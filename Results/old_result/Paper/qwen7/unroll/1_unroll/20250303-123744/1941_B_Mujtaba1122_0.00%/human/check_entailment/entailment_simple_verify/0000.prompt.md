You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list are zero; otherwise, it does not return anything.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a` of length `n`, where `3 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5` and `0 <= a_j \le 10^9`.

    #State: Output State: The list will be such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was greater than 1 initially and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by its own value, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.

If these conditions are not met, `list[i]`, `list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` will remain unchanged. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the reduction of elements according to the given operation rules. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. According to the problem description, we need to check if we can reduce all elements to zero using the specified operations. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the reduction process.

For instance, in the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, applying the operation at `i=3` would result in `[2, 4, 3, 3, 1]`, but the subsequent operations do not lead to all elements becoming zero. The function `func_2` does not ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
