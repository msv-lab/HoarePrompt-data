You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False

        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer representing the length of the list.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The list remains unchanged, and the function returns True if all elements in the list are zero; otherwise, it never returns (the loop completes without returning).
    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements in the list are zero; otherwise, it does not return anything.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and a positive integer representing the length of the list. It checks if all elements in the list are zero. If all elements are zero, it returns True; otherwise, it does not return anything.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a` of length `n`, where `3 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5` and `0 <= a_j \le 10^9`.
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: The list will be such that for every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was greater than 1 initially and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by its own value, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: For every element `list[i]` where `1 < i < n-1`, if `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by its own value, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. If these conditions are not met, `list[i]`, `list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` will remain unchanged. After all possible reductions, the elements that were originally 0 or less than or equal to 1 will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and its length as parameters. It iterates through the list (excluding the first and last elements) and reduces certain elements based on specific conditions. After processing, it checks if all elements in the list are less than or equal to 18. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list is such that elements that were initially greater than 1 and had neighbors greater than 0 have been reduced according to specified rules, while other elements remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations involve choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 3.
   - To make all elements zero, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 3.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to perform the operations to reduce the array elements to zero.
     - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
     - For each element `a[i]` greater than 1, it ensures that `a[i-1]` is also greater than 0 and `a[i+1]` is greater than 0 before performing the operation.
     - The operation reduces `a[i-1]` by `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` by `2 * a[i-1]`, and `a[i+1]` by `a[i-1]`.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies the operations to reduce the array elements.
   - However, the function directly prints 'YES' or 'NO' without returning a value, which is not suitable for a function intended to be part of a larger program.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The main function should call `func_2` for each test case and check if `func_1` returns `True`.
   - Since `func_2` is designed to modify the array in place and print the result, it is not ideal for a main function that needs to return a value.

6. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The program does not return a value but prints 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - This makes it unsuitable for a function that should return a boolean value indicating whether it is possible to make all elements zero.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not meet the requirement of returning a boolean value. Instead, it prints the result directly. Therefore, the program is not correct for the given problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
