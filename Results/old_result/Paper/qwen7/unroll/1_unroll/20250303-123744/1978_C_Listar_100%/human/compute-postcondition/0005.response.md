Output State: **`l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, `n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `k` is the return value of `func_4()` and `n` is not equal to 0.**

In this case, the function `func_1(n, k)` is called with `n` and `k` as arguments, and `l` is assigned the return value of this function call. The initial conditions for `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `n` is still not equal to 0.
