Output State: **`l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, `n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `k` is the return value of `func_4()`, and `func_5(l)` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `func_5(l)` calls the function `func_5` with the argument `l`. Since `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, `n` is the return value of `func_4()`, and `k` is also the return value of `func_4()`, and `n` is not equal to 0, the only change is that `func_5(l)` has been called. The values of `l`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
