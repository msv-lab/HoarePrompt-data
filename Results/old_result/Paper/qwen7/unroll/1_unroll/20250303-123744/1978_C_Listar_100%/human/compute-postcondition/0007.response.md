Output State: **The program returns the value of `l`, which is the result of calling `func_5(l)` with the input `l` that itself is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, where `n` and `k` are both the results of calling `func_4()`**

This means the program returns the value of `l`, which is determined by the nested function calls starting from `func_4()` and ending with `func_5()`.
