Output State: **The program returns None**

Explanation: The provided code snippet does not return any value; it simply uses the `return` statement without specifying a value. Given the initial state where `n` and `k` both equal the return value of `func_4()`, which is 0, the `return` statement here does not change this fact. Therefore, the program returns `None`, as no specific value is provided in the return statement.
