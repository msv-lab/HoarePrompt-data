Output State: **`n` is the return value of `func_4()`, `k` is the return value of `func_4()`**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_4()` calls the function `func_4()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_4()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `k`. However, we know that both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12`. Therefore, the output state indicates that `n` and `k` are the return values from `func_4()`.
