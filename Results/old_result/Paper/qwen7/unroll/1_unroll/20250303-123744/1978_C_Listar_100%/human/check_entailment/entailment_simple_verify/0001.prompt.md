You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **func_4()**: This function checks if \( k \) is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \). It returns \( (0, 0) \) if \( k \) is odd or if \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - **func_1()**: This function attempts to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value. It uses a recursive approach with helper functions `func_2()` and `func_3()`.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: These functions swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - **func_5()**: This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - **func_6()**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4()` and `func_1()`, and then calls `func_5()` to print the result.

3. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - **func_4()**: Ensures \( k \) is even and within the valid range. If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns invalid values.
   - **func_1()**: Constructs the permutation by recursively swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic seems to handle even and odd \( n \) correctly.
   - **func_2()** and **func_3()**: Swap elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value, ensuring the permutation remains valid.
   - **func_5()**: Correctly prints the permutation if found.
   - **func_6()**: Properly handles the input and calls the necessary functions to solve the problem.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases like odd \( k \), odd \( n \), and when \( k \) exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
   - The recursive approach in `func_1()` ensures that the permutation is built correctly by adjusting the Manhattan value through swaps.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists.
