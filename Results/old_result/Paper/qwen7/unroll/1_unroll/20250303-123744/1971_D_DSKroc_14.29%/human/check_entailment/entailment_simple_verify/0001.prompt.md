You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, the output is the number of positions where the digit is greater than the next digit in the string representation of the input, plus one.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's followed by all '1's).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second last character.
   - If a character `s[i]` is greater than the next character `s[i+1]`, it increments the counter `count`.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of counting the number of positions where the current character is greater than the next character is flawed. This approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of cuts needed.
   - For example, consider the string "101". The program would count this as needing 1 cut (at index 1), but the correct answer should be 2 cuts (splitting at both '0' and '1').
   - The program needs to identify the positions where the sequence changes from '0' to '1'. Each such change indicates a potential split point.
   - The correct approach would be to iterate through the string and count the number of times the sequence changes from '0' to '1'.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - Initialize a counter `count` to zero.
   - Iterate through the string from the first character to the second last character.
   - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', increment the counter.
   - The final result should be `count + 1` (since the last segment is always a valid segment).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of cuts needed. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
