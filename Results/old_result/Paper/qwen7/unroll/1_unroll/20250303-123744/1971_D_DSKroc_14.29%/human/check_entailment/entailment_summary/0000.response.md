Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit in the binary string. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The logic `if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):` checks if a '1' is followed by a '0', which is not the correct criterion for determining the minimum number of cuts.
- To solve the problem, we need to find the positions where the sequence changes from '0' to '1'. Each such change indicates a potential cut point because after the cut, we can rearrange the pieces to form a sorted binary string.
- The correct approach would be to iterate through the string and count the number of transitions from '0' to '1'. This count will give us the minimum number of pieces required.

Given the execution summary, the program is not correctly identifying these transition points.

Correctness: **False**
