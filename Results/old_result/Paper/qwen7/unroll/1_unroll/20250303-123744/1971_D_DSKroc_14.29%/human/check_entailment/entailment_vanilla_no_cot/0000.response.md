Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `for` loop checks if the current character is greater than the next character, which is not the right approach for this problem. This condition would only identify positions where the order of characters is violated but doesn't account for the requirement to split the string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

To solve this problem correctly, we should:
1. Identify the last position of '0' in the string.
2. Count the number of segments formed by the transition from '0' to '1'.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Find the index of the last '0' in the string
        last_zero_index = s.rfind('0')
        # If there are no '0's, the string is already sorted
        if last_zero_index == -1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # The number of pieces needed is the index of the last '0' plus one
            print(last_zero_index + 1)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
