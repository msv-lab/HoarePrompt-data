Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, the value of `t` remains within this range after executing the code. The other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged.
