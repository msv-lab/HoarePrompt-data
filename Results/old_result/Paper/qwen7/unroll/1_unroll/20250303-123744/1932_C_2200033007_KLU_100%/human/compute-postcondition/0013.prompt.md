You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, and s is a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. After the loop executes all the iterations, `b` contains elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, `p` is 1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n (a positive integer), m (a positive integer), a (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive), and s (a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element in 'ans' is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
