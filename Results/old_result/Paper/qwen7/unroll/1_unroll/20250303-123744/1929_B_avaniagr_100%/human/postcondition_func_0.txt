The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible values based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \): \( \text{math.ceil}(k / 2) \), \( 2n - 1 \), or \( 2n \). The function reads these values from standard input, processes them according to the given conditions, and outputs the results to standard output.
