Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that the input value (which is used as the argument to `range`) can be any integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, the input value must be a positive integer. Since `t` is the upper bound for the number of test cases, the loop will run exactly `t` times. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range.

Given the constraints, the initial state should be adjusted to reflect that the input value must be within the specified range.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- The input value (which is used as the argument to `range`) must be an integer within the same range as `t`.

Since the loop will run `t` times, the input value itself must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and the input value must be an integer within the same range**
