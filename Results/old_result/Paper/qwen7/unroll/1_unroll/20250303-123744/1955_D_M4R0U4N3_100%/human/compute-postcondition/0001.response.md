Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**.

The code initializes a list `cnt_b` with 1000001 elements, all set to 0. This list is used to count something related to the values from 0 to 1000000. The values of `t` and `max_val` remain unchanged.
