Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000 and `cnt_b` to a list of zeros with a length of `max_val + 1`. This is used to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case using a loop controlled by the variable `t` (number of test cases).

3. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

4. **Counting Elements in `b`**: It populates `cnt_b` with the counts of elements in `b`.

5. **Sliding Window Technique**: 
   - It uses a sliding window approach to check each subarray of length `m` in `a`.
   - It maintains a counter `curr` to keep track of the number of elements from `b` that are currently in the current window.
   - For each position in the window, it checks if the element in `a` is in `b`. If it is, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
   - If `curr` reaches or exceeds `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

6. **Sliding the Window**: As the window slides, it adjusts `cnt_b` and `curr` by adding the new element entering the window and removing the element leaving the window.

7. **Resetting `cnt_b`**: After processing each test case, it resets `cnt_b` to zero for the next test case.

8. **Output**: It prints the count of good subarrays for each test case.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
