Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the square root of n does not exceed 2⋅10^3, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the square root of m does not exceed 2⋅10^3, `cnt` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cnt` to 0. The values of `x`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial states.
