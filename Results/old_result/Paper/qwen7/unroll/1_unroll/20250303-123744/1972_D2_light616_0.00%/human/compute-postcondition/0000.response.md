Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the square root of n does not exceed 2⋅10^3, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the square root of m does not exceed 2⋅10^3.**

The code initializes `x` to 1, but it does not affect the values of `n` and `m`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
