Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and a new variable `data` is created and assigned the list of strings resulting from the split operation. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the specified range remains valid, and the new variable `data` holds the split input.
