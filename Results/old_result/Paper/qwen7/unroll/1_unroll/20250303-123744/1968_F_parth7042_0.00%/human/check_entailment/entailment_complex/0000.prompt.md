Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #State: Output State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing 'NO' repeated `q * (t - 1)` times followed by an empty string.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration processes `n` elements and `q` queries. After processing all `t` iterations, the index `idx` will be incremented by `2 * t` (2 for each iteration), resulting in `idx` being 6. The `results` list will contain `q * (t - 1)` 'NO' responses followed by one empty string, as no conditions for 'YES' were met in the given code snippet.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: NO\nNO\n... (2q times)\n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` integers, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` whose bitwise XOR is zero. If such a subarray is found, the result for that query is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The function then prints the results for all queries in the order they were processed, followed by an empty line.
