Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` integers, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, the function processes the queries and returns the results of these queries.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves processing a list of integers `a` with a specified range `[l, r]` for `q` queries. The function does not return a single value but processes and returns results for all queries within each test case.
