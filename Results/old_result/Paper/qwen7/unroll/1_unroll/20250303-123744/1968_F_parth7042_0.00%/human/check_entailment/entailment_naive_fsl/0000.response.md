Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify interesting subarrays in some cases. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

The program should output:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

Let's analyze the third query (l=3, r=5):
- Subarray: `[2, 3, 0]`
- Prefix XOR values: `pf = [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]`
- Query: `pf[5] ^ pf[2] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`

The program checks if `x == 0` and finds it is not, so it proceeds to check the positions in the map. However, the positions in the map are not correctly handled for this case. The positions for `pf[5]` and `pf[2]` are `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2]`, respectively. The program incorrectly concludes that the subarray is not interesting.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the positions are correctly checked and that the subarray can be divided into multiple parts with equal XOR values. The current implementation does not correctly handle all edge cases and may miss some interesting subarrays.
