Output State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing 'NO' repeated `q * (t - 1)` times followed by an empty string.

Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration processes `n` elements and `q` queries. After processing all `t` iterations, the index `idx` will be incremented by `2 * t` (2 for each iteration), resulting in `idx` being 6. The `results` list will contain `q * (t - 1)` 'NO' responses followed by one empty string, as no conditions for 'YES' were met in the given code snippet.
