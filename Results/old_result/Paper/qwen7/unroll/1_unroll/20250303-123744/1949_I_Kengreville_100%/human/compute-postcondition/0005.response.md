Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are all `None`, `y[0]` to `y[n-1]` are all `None`, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, and the values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` remain unchanged.**

The code initializes the `coef` list to be a list of length `n` filled with `None`. No other changes are made to the existing lists or variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated `coef` list while keeping the rest of the variables and their states unchanged.
