Output State: `bipartite` is True/False, `n` is the value read from input, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are integers, `y[0] to y[n-1]` are integers, `r[0]` to `r[n-1]` are integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `True`, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None`, `tot` is an integer, `ok` is True/False.

In this output state, the `visited` list will be filled with `True` for all indices since every node is visited during the DFS. The `coef` list will contain `1` for nodes that were part of a valid bipartition and `None` for others. The `bipartite` variable will be `True` if at least one component is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot` (total weight), otherwise it will be `False`. The `tot` variable will hold the sum of weights for the component that is determined to be bipartite. The `ok` variable will be `True` if any component meets the criteria for being bipartite and having a non-zero `tot`, otherwise it will be `False`.
