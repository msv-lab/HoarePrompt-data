The function reads the number of disks and their coordinates and radii from input. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on each unvisited disk to determine if the component formed by connected disks is bipartite. If any component is found to be bipartite and contains more than one disk, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function modifies the `visited` list to mark all disks as visited and updates the `coef` list to store coefficients during the DFS process. The final state of the program includes the updated `visited` and `coef` lists, and the output 'YES' or 'NO' based on the bipartite property of the components.
