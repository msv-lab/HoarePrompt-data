Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` should be initialized to 0 because `range(n)` generates values from 0 to `n-1`.
   - `n` should be the value read from input.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - `total` (which is 0) is not directly related to the loop execution.
   - `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and `ok` are not directly related to the loop execution either.
   - `bipartite` is a boolean variable but its value (`True`) does not affect the loop execution directly.

Given this analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified as follows:

State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the value read from input**
