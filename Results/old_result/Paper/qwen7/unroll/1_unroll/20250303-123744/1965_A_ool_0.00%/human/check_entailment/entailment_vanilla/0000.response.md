Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles.
2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner for each test case and prints the result.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Initial Check**: The function checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns "Alice". This is correct because if the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always reduce all piles to one stone and force Bob into a losing position.
   - **Set Processing**: The function converts the array to a sorted set to handle duplicate values and check the differences between consecutive elements.
   - **Winning Condition**: The function iterates through the sorted set to check if the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. It also toggles the boolean variable `A` based on the parity of the number of elements with a difference of exactly 1.
   - **Final Decision**: The function returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise. However, this logic seems flawed because it doesn't correctly implement the game's winning condition based on the XOR of the pile sizes.

The given solution does not correctly implement the game's strategy. The correct approach involves using the XOR of the pile sizes to determine the winner. Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The function should compute the XOR of all pile sizes and check if the result is zero. If the XOR is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
- The current function incorrectly handles the game logic and does not account for the XOR-based winning condition.

Correctness: **False**
