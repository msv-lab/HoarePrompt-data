Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum number of cells to color when \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \) is incorrect. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `4 7`
- Expected Output: `4`

However, the program outputs `4`, which seems correct at first glance. But let's analyze further:

For \( n = 4 \), the total number of diagonals is \( 4 \times 4 - 2 = 14 \). To satisfy \( k = 7 \), we need to ensure that 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program calculates `k // 2 + 1` which is `4` for \( k = 7 \).

To verify, let's manually check if 4 cells can indeed cover 7 diagonals:
- One possible configuration is coloring the cells at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), and (4,4). This covers 8 diagonals (4 main diagonals and 4 anti-diagonals).

Since 4 cells can cover 8 diagonals, the program's output of 4 is correct for this specific case. However, the issue arises when considering other configurations and larger values of \( n \) and \( k \).

For example, consider the case:
- Input: `5 10`
- Expected Output: `5`

The program outputs `5`, but let's see if 5 cells can cover 10 diagonals:
- One possible configuration is coloring the cells at positions (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4), and (5,5). This covers 10 diagonals (5 main diagonals and 5 anti-diagonals).

This configuration works, but the program's logic might fail in more complex scenarios. For instance, if \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 11 \), the program would output `6`, but a manual check shows that 6 cells can indeed cover 11 diagonals.

Given these observations, the program's logic for handling the condition \( k > 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \) is not robust enough to cover all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
