Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the given conditions within the loop. For each test case, if \( k = 1 \), the output will be `1`. If \( k \leq 2(n + (n - 2)) \), the output will be the ceiling value of \( k / 2 \). Otherwise, the output will be \( k // 2 + 1 \).

This means the output will be a list of integers, one for each test case, following the specified logic.
