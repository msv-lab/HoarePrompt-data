Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts the characters in `s` based on their balance and position, and prints a new string composed of these characters. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, a sorted list of `BalanceInfo` objects, and a printed string `result` composed of characters from `s` based on the sorting rules.**
