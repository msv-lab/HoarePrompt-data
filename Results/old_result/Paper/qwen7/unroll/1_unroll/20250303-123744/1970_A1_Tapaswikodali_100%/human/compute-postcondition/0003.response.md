Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `balance_info` is an empty list.
   - `balance` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0`, `i` should be set to 0.
   - `n` is already defined as the length of `s`, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - `balance_info` and `balance` are not directly involved in the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0**
