Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `mex` is an empty list, `used` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `used`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
