Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer; `mex` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `minn = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `minn`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
