The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n` and prints a sequence of integers `mex`. For each element in `a`, if the element is positive, `mex` contains the smallest non-negative integer not present in `a` up to that point. If the element is negative, `mex` contains the smallest non-negative integer that would make the element non-negative when subtracted from it. The function does not return any value but prints the sequence `mex` for each test case.
