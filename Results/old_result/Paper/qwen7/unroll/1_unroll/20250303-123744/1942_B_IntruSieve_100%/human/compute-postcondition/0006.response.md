Output State: **`minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, `mex` is a list containing elements that are increments of `minn` based on conditions in the loop, `used` is a dictionary marking integers that have been used according to the loop logic.**

To explain further in natural language:
After the loop executes all its iterations, `minn` will be incremented until it is at least as large as the largest number in the list `a`. The list `mex` will contain values that are the minimum available `minn` when `arr[i]` is positive, and the difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` when `arr[i]` is negative. The dictionary `used` will mark all integers that were selected as `minn` or calculated as differences in the loop.
