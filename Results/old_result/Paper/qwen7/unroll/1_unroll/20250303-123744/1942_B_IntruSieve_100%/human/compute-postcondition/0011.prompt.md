You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; there is at least one valid permutation p for the given data; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `a`, `mex` is a list containing elements that are increments of `minn` based on conditions in the loop, `used` is a dictionary marking integers that have been used according to the loop logic.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The loop prints each element in the list `mex` separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function returns a valid permutation `p` of the list `a` where the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
