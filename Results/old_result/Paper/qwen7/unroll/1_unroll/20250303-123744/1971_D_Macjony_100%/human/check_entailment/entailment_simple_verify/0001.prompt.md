You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and for each input string `s`, the variable `count` is calculated based on the rules inside the loop. If there is at least one occurrence where '0' is followed by '1', `count` will be decremented by 1 before printing. The final value of `count` for each string `s` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string (i.e., all '0's before all '1's).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each character must lie in exactly one piece.
   - Pieces must be contiguous substrings.
   - All pieces must be used in the rearrangement.

3. **Analysis of the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `count` to 1 (indicating at least one piece is needed).
   - It iterates through the string to check for transitions from '0' to '1'.
   - If a transition is found, `count` is incremented, indicating an additional piece is needed.
   - After the loop, if a transition was found (`flag` is true), it decrements `count` by 1 because the transition itself can be split into two pieces, but they can be combined into one piece for the final sorted string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted, no cuts are needed, and `count` remains 1.
   - If there are multiple transitions, each transition increases the required pieces by one until the last transition, which is handled by decrementing `count`.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the transitions and ensures that the minimum number of pieces is calculated.
   - The decrement of `count` when a transition is found is appropriate because the transition can be split into two pieces, but they can be combined into one piece for the final sorted string.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
