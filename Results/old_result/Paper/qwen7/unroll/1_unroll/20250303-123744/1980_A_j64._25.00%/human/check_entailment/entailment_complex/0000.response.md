Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly follows the problem statement and the provided test cases.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case by:
   - Counting the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the input string `a`.
   - Calculating the shortfall for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of problems `m` with the current frequency.
   - Summing these shortfalls to get the total number of additional problems needed.
3. The logic implemented in the function is consistent with the problem requirements and the provided examples.
4. The function handles multiple test cases as expected and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Given the above points, the program is correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
