Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing the number of problems in the bank, the number of upcoming rounds, and the string of problem difficulties).

2. **Initialization**: It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: For each test case, it extracts the values of `n`, `m`, and `a` (the string of problem difficulties).

4. **Frequency Count**: It creates a list `freq` of size 7 (corresponding to the difficulty levels 'A' to 'G') and increments the count for each difficulty level found in the string `a`.

5. **Calculate Missing Problems**: For each difficulty level, it checks if the current count (`f`) is less than the required number of problems (`m`). If so, it calculates the shortfall and sums these shortfalls to get the total number of additional problems needed.

6. **Store Result**: The calculated number of additional problems is appended to the `results` list.

7. **Return Results**: Finally, the function returns the list of results.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the function correctly computes the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
