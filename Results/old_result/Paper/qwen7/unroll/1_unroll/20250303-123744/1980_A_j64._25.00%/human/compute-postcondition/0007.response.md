Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: two positive integers `n` and `m` (with 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5), and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list named `results` which contains `t` elements. Each element in the list represents the number of missing characters for each test case, calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the corresponding string `a`.**
