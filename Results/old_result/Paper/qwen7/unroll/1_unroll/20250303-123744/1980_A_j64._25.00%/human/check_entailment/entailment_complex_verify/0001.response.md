### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly accepts the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`.
   - Each test case is a tuple containing `n` (number of problems in the bank), `m` (number of upcoming rounds), and `a` (a string of problem difficulties).

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - A frequency array `freq` of size 7 is initialized to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - The program correctly iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the frequency array.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**:
   - For each difficulty level, the program calculates the shortfall by comparing the required number of problems (`m`) with the current frequency (`f`).
   - If the required number of problems exceeds the current frequency, the difference is added to `missing`.
   - This calculation is done for each difficulty level, and the sum of these differences gives the total number of additional problems needed.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - The program appends the total number of missing problems for each test case to the `results` list.
   - Finally, the function returns the `results` list.

5. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main part of the program initializes the test cases and calls `func_1` with these test cases.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the logic in the program appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure there are enough problems for `m` rounds.

The original assessment is accurate because:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The frequency array is used appropriately to count the occurrences of each difficulty level.
- The calculation of the missing problems is done correctly by comparing the required number of problems with the current frequency.
- The final results are compiled and returned correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
