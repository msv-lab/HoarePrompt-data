The function calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of additional problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') needed for each test case to meet the required number of problems (`m`) in the upcoming rounds. For each test case, it counts the frequency of each character in the given string of problem difficulties, then determines the shortfall for each character by comparing these frequencies with the required number of problems (`m`). The function processes `t` test cases and returns a list of these shortfalls for each test case.
