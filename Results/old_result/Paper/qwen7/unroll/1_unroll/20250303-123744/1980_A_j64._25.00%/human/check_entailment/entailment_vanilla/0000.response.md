Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the number of test cases and a list of test cases as input.
2. For each test case, it initializes a frequency array `freq` of size 7 (to count occurrences of difficulties 'A' to 'G').
3. It iterates through the string of problem difficulties and increments the corresponding index in the frequency array.
4. It calculates how many problems are missing for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the current frequency (`f`). If the required number exceeds the current frequency, it adds the difference to `missing`.
5. It sums up all the missing problems across all difficulty levels.
6. The result is appended to the `results` list for each test case.
7. Finally, the function returns the list of results.
8. The main part of the program initializes the test cases and calls `func_1` with these test cases. It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the logic in the program appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure there are enough problems for `m` rounds.

Correctness: **True**
