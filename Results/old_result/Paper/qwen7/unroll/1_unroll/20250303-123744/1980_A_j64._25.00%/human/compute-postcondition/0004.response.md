Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element represents the number of missing occurrences of characters 'A' to 'G' in the corresponding string from the `test_cases` list after comparing them with the value `m`. Each element in `results` is calculated based on the frequency of each character in the string and the difference between `m` and the maximum possible frequency for any character in the string.
