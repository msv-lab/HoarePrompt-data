### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases as input. This matches the problem description and the input format.

2. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The frequency array `freq` is initialized to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). This step is correct and necessary to determine the shortfall in problems for each difficulty level.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the program iterates through the string of problem difficulties and updates the frequency array. This ensures that the counts of each difficulty level are accurately tracked.
   - The calculation of `missing` uses the formula `sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)`, which correctly determines the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the required number of rounds `m` is greater than the current frequency `f`, the difference is added to `missing`.

4. **Result Compilation:**
   - The results are compiled into a list `results`, which is returned by the function. This ensures that the output is structured correctly and matches the expected format.

5. **Main Program Execution:**
   - The main part of the program initializes the test cases and calls `func_1` with these test cases. It then prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the detailed analysis and the provided examples, the logic in the program appears to be correct. It accurately calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure there are enough problems for `m` rounds.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
