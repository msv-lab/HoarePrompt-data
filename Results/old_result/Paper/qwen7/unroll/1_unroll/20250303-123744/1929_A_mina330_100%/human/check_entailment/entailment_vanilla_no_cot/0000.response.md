Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in the solution sorts the array and then calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest element at the beginning and the smallest at the end, but also ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. A better approach would be to sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements appropriately to maximize the sum of differences.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            max_beauty += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 == 1:
            max_beauty += a[n // 2]
        print(max_beauty)
```

This solution correctly pairs the largest and smallest elements to maximize the sum of differences.
