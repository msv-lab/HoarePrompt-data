### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element, thereby maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then sorts the array and prints the difference between the last (largest) and the first (smallest) elements.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - Sorting the array and taking the difference between the last and first elements will indeed maximize the beauty because:
     - The sorted array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element.
     - This maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, the code only considers the difference between the last and first elements, which is not sufficient to maximize the beauty. The beauty is the sum of differences between all consecutive elements, not just the first and last.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are the same, the beauty will be zero, which is correctly handled by the code.
   - The code handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints, but it does not consider the sum of all differences between consecutive elements.

6. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code states that the function calculates and outputs the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the list for each test case.
   - This is a simplification of the actual problem, which requires summing all differences between consecutive elements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the beauty of the array. It only considers the difference between the first and last elements, which is not sufficient to achieve the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
