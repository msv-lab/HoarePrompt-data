Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and a list of n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not detailed in the provided information.
