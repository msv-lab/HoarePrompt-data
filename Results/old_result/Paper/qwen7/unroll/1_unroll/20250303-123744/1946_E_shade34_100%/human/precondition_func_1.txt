a is an integer, and b is a list of integers where the length of b is equal to the number of test cases. Each element in b is a tuple (m1, m2, n) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, m1, m2, and n satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ m1, m2, n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
