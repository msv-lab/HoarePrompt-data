Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` is the return value of `func_1(b, a)`, and `d` is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`**.

This means that the function `func_1(b, a)` has been called with `b` and `a` as arguments, and it has returned two values which are now stored in `c` and `d`. The preconditions for `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
