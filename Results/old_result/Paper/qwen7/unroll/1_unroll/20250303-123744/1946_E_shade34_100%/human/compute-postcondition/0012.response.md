Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both non-negative integers with `a >= b > 0`. It returns either 1 and 0, or d and c where c is the return value of `func_1(b, a)` and d is the second return value of `func_1(b, a)`, or 1 and -(a // b - 1), or the remainder of `b` divided by `(a % b)` and the difference between `c` and the floor division of `a` by `b` multiplied by the remainder of `b` divided by `(a % b)` depending on the conditions met.**
