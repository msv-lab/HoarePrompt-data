You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().strip().split())
        
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        
        results.append(winner)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `results` is a list containing 1000 elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop with `a` and `b` being integers provided by user input.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; the `results` list contains the same 1000 elements, which are the results of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop with `a` and `b` being integers provided by user input. The loop simply prints each element in the `results` list without modifying it.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns either an integer result or an error message based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
