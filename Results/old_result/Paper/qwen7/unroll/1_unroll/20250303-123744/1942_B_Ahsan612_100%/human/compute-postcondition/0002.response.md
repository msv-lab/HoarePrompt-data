Output State: t test cases, each with n integers representing the result of the transformation applied to the input list ar. For each test case, the result list res is generated by iterating over the input list ar in reverse order, calculating the minimum excluded number (mex) for each position, and storing the difference between mex and the current element of ar in the corresponding position of res. The final output for each test case is a space-separated string of these differences.
