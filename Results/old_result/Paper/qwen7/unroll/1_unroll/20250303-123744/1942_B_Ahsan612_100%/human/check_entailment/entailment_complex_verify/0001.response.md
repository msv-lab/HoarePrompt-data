### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each index \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The function \(\texttt{MEX}\) returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes a list `res` with `None` values.
   - It iterates backward through the array `ar` and calculates the value for each position in `res`.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( res[i] = \texttt{MEX} - ar[i] \).
   - It updates \(\texttt{MEX}\) to ensure it correctly reflects the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating \(\texttt{MEX}\) is flawed because it directly uses the value of \(\texttt{MEX}\) without considering the actual elements of \( p \) that have been assigned.
   - The solution should maintain a set of used indices to correctly compute \(\texttt{MEX}\) for each prefix.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used indices and dynamically updating \(\texttt{MEX}\) based on the current state of the permutation \( p \).

5. **Detailed Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code initializes `res` with `None` values and iterates backward through `ar`.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( res[i] = \texttt{MEX} - ar[i] \).
   - It updates \(\texttt{MEX}\) to reflect the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \).
   - However, the code does not correctly update \(\texttt{MEX}\) based on the actual elements of \( p \) that have been assigned. Instead, it simply decrements \(\texttt{MEX}\) by the value of \( ar[i] \), which is incorrect.

6. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the test case: \( n = 5 \) and \( ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \).
   - The expected output is \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \).
   - The code will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly compute \(\texttt{MEX}\) based on the actual elements of \( p \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle the calculation of \(\texttt{MEX}\) and the construction of the permutation \( p \). Therefore, the given program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
