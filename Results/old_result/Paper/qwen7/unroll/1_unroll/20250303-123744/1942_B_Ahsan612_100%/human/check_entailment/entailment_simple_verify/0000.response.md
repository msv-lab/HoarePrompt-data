### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the provided code and why it fails to generate a valid permutation \( p \):

1. **Initialization and Update of `mex`:**
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which is the length of the array. This is generally correct for the first element of the permutation.
   - However, the logic to update `mex` inside the loop is flawed. The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]: mex = mex - ar[i]` is incorrect. This condition does not correctly update `mex` to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`.

2. **Backward Iteration:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the array `ar`, but the logic to determine the value of `res[i]` is incorrect. The value of `res[i]` should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`, which is the definition of `MEX`.

3. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case provided: `5 1 1 -2 1 2`.
   - The expected output is a valid permutation like `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
   - However, the provided code generates an incorrect permutation due to the flawed logic for updating `mex`.

Let's illustrate with the given test case:
- For `i = 4`, `ar[4] = 2`, so `res[4] = mex - 2`. Initially, `mex = 5`, so `res[4] = 3`.
- For `i = 3`, `ar[3] = 1`, so `res[3] = mex - 1`. Still, `mex = 5`, so `res[3] = 4`.
- For `i = 2`, `ar[2] = -2`, so `res[2] = mex - (-2) = mex + 2`. Again, `mex = 5`, so `res[2] = 7` (out of bounds).

These issues indicate that the code does not correctly compute the MEX value and assign valid permutation values to `res`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly generate a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \) due to the flawed logic for updating `mex` and assigning values to `res`.

**Final: False**
