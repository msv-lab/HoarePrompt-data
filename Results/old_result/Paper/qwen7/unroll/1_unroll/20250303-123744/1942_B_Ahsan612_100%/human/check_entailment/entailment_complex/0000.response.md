Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by generating a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Here's a step-by-step analysis of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Construction**: For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
3. **Result Array Initialization**: It initializes the result array \( res \) of size \( n \) with `None` values.
4. **Backward Iteration**: The program iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order. This is crucial because it allows the calculation of the minimum excluded number (mex) for each position in the array.
5. **Mex Calculation and Result Assignment**: For each position \( i \), it calculates the mex by checking if the current value \( mex \) is greater than the value obtained by subtracting \( ar[i] \) from \( mex \). If so, it updates \( mex \) to the new value. Then, it assigns the difference \( mex - ar[i] \) to the corresponding position in \( res \).

However, there is a logical error in the mex calculation. Specifically, the condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]:` is always true, which means \( mex \) is never updated correctly. Instead, the correct approach should be to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray \( ar[i+1:n] \).

To fix this, we need to maintain a set of seen numbers and calculate the mex dynamically for each position.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        seen = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if j not in seen:
                    mex = j
                    break
            
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            seen.add(mex)
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the original logic and the provided explanation, the initial implementation was flawed. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is:

Correctness: **False**
