Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `n` is a positive integer read from the standard input, and it determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Adjust the states based on the loop requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop starts from `i = 0` and increments `i` until `i < n`.
   - `i` should be set to 0 as it is the starting point of the loop.

4. **Consider other relevant states**:
   - The state of `points`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, and `goal` are not directly affected by the loop itself and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
