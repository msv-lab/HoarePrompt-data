Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.
3. The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement according to the problem statement.

Specifically:
- The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the time to exit the grid using cumulative sums of positions of `>` and `<` characters, but it does not properly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of directions.
- The logic for calculating the time to exit the grid is incorrect because it does not account for the actual movement of the pinball and the inversion of directions after each move.
- The function does not correctly handle the pinball's movement and the changes in direction as specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
