The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It calculates and prints a series of values based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in the string. These values are derived from cumulative sums of positions of '>' and '<' characters, adjusted by their respective indices. If the counts of '<' and '>' characters are not equal, the function prints the difference; otherwise, it prints 0.
