You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 26:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases (t), each containing an integer (n) within the range 3 to 78. For each integer, it constructs a string (word) based on specific conditions and prints the result. The function does not return any value but produces output for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the encoded integer `n`.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - If `n > 52`, it means the encoded value is too high for a two-letter combination starting with 'a'. Hence, it calculates the third letter using `alphabet[n - 53]` and appends 'zz'.
   - If `26 < n <= 52`, it means the encoded value can be represented by a combination of 'a', a second letter, and 'z'. It calculates the second letter using `alphabet[n - 28]` and appends 'z'.
   - If `n <= 26`, it means the encoded value can be represented by 'aa' and the third letter. It calculates the third letter using `alphabet[n - 3]`.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The logic ensures that the word generated is the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given encoded integer.
   - For example, for `n = 24`, the program correctly outputs "aav" because the smallest possible word is "aav" (1 + 1 + 22 = 24).
   - For `n = 70`, the program correctly outputs "rzz" because the smallest possible word is "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26 = 70).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is exactly 26 (outputting "aaa") and when `n` is less than 26 (outputting words like "auz").

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the generated word for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.
