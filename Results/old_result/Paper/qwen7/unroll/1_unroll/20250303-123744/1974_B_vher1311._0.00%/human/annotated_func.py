#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The string s represents the result of encoding some original string according to the given algorithm, and the length of s is at most 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: i is 0, j is -1.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns an empty string since there are no unique characters to join, given that `i` is 0 and `j` is -1, and no list or string containing characters is mentioned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It processes the string by replacing each character with the last unique character found in the string, then inserts any remaining unique characters into a new list. After processing, it returns an empty string if no unique characters are left to join, otherwise, it returns a string of the processed unique characters.
