Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is defined by the `for char in s:` statement. This means the loop variable is `char`, and it iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop head**: The only variable involved in the loop head is `char`. However, the loop also implicitly depends on the string `s` because `char` is iterating over each character in `s`.

3. **Identify the initial state**: The initial state given is `i` is 0 and `j` is `len(unique_chars) - 1`. These variables are not directly involved in the loop head but might be part of the loop body or some external context.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, the string `s` must contain at least one character. If `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the string `s` to ensure it contains at least one character.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is len(`unique_chars`) - 1, `s` is a non-empty string**
