Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each set also contains n - 1 lines describing the edges of the tree where each line contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration, and the `solve()` function is called with the input data for each set of input.

In simpler terms: The number of sets of input data (represented by `t`) is reduced by one after all iterations of the loop have finished.
