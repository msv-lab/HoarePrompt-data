Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed for each query within each test case. For each test case, there are `t` queries, and for each query, the output is the interpolated value based on the given sequences `a` and `b`. The interpolated value is calculated using the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, and it is printed for each query. The process repeats for each of the `t` test cases.
