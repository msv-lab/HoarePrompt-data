### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`. It also reads the positions `a` and times `b` at which the car arrives at these positions.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and the corresponding speeds between these points in `b`. This part is correctly implemented.

3. **Speed Calculation**: The program computes the speed between each pair of points using the formula \( \text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \). This calculation is done correctly.

4. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried point `d` lies. If `d` exactly matches a known position, it returns the corresponding time directly. Otherwise, it calculates the remaining distance within the current segment and adds the accumulated time up to the previous segment plus the time taken to travel the remaining distance.

5. **Output**: The program prints the time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer, which is handled correctly.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the queried point exactly matches a known position and when the point lies between two known positions.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle the problem statement correctly without any logical errors.
