Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given specifications. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Calculating Speed Segments**: It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and `b` and then computes the speed for each segment using these distances.

3. **Query Processing**: For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the target point `d` lies. It then calculates the exact time taken to reach `d` within that segment.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated times for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

The logic and implementation appear sound and should handle the constraints and examples provided accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is True.
