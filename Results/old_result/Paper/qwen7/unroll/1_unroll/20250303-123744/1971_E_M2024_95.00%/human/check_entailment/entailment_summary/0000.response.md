Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
3. It constructs the lists `a` and `b` which represent the positions and times at those positions, respectively.
4. It calculates the speeds (`v`) between consecutive points using the differences in positions (`ad`) and times (`bd`).
5. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the position in `a` where the queried distance (`ql`) would fall.
6. If the queried distance matches exactly with a known position, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
7. Otherwise, it interpolates the time taken to travel from the previous known position to the queried distance and adds the time taken to travel from the start to the previous known position.

Given the steps and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and produce the expected results based on the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
