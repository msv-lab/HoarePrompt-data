#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers such that k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and a_i < a_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1, and a_k = n. b is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 and b_i < b_{i+1} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ k-1. d is a list of q integers where 0 ≤ d ≤ n.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of integers printed for each query within each test case. For each test case, there are `t` queries, and for each query, the output is the interpolated value based on the given sequences `a` and `b`. The interpolated value is calculated using the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, and it is printed for each query. The process repeats for each of the `t` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a range of values defined by lists `a` and `b`, and answers `q` queries for each test case. For each query, it calculates an interpolated value based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, and prints the result. The function repeats this process for each of the `t` test cases.
