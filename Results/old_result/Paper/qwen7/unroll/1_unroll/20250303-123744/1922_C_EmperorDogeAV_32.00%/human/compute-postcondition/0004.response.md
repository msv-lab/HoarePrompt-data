Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones**

Explanation: Given that `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is initially a list of \( n - 1 \) ones, the loop iterates through each city (except the first and last). For each city \( i \) (where \( 1 < i < n-1 \)), the code checks if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city. Since the cities are in ascending order, the distance to the next city will always be less than the distance to the previous city. Therefore, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1 for all valid indices. Hence, the final state of `prog_cities` remains a list of \( n - 1 \) ones.
