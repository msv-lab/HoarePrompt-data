    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and compares the distance to the next city with the distance to the previous city. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference in coordinates, which will always be larger than 1 based on the problem constraints. Since the cities are in ascending order, the distance to the next city will always be less than the distance to the previous city, leading to `prog_cities[i]` being set to 1 for all valid indices.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities in ascending order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. After processing, it returns a list of \( n - 1 \) ones. Specifically, for each city except the first and last, it checks the distance to the next city versus the previous city. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the corresponding position in the output list to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference in coordinates, which will always be greater than 1 given the problem constraints. Since the cities are in ascending order, the distance to the next city is always less, resulting in all positions in the output list being set to 1.
