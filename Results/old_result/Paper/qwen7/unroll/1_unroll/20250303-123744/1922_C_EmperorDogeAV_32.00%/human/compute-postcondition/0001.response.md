State: **`cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros, `i` is 0, `n - 1` must be a valid index for the list `cities`**

### Explanation:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition `range(n - 1)` means that the loop will iterate from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive). Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.
4. **List Validity**: Since `i` ranges from `0` to `n - 2`, `n - 1` must be a valid index for the list `cities`. This ensures that the loop can access elements in the list `cities`.

Given these points, the state before the loop should include:
- The initial value of `i` as 0.
- The condition that `n - 1` must be a valid index for the list `cities`.

Thus, the final state is:
**`cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros, `i` is 0, `n - 1` must be a valid index for the list `cities`**
