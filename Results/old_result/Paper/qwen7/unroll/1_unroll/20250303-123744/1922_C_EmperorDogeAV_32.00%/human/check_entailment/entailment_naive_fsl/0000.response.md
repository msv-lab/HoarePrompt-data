Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city. Specifically, the `func_1` function is supposed to determine the direction (forward or backward) to move towards the closest city, but it does not correctly handle the logic for determining the closest city for each position. Instead, it seems to be calculating the difference in distances without properly identifying the closest city.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program fails to produce these results because it does not correctly identify the closest city for each position. The `func_1` function should return an array indicating the direction (forward or backward) to move towards the closest city, but it calculates the differences incorrectly.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify the closest city for each position and then determine the direction (forward or backward) to move towards that city.
