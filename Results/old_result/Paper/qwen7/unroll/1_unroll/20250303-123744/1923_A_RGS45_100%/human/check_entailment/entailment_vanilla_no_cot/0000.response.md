Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the function `func()` is flawed. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Free Cells**: The code finds the first occurrence (`x`) and the last occurrence (`y`) of '1' (indicating a chip) but does not correctly handle the movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left.

2. **Z Slice and Counting Zeroes**: The variable `z` is sliced incorrectly, and counting the zeroes in `z` does not give the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to count the number of gaps between consecutive chips. The number of operations required will be the sum of these gaps minus the number of gaps plus one (since moving a chip to the left reduces the number of gaps).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        chips_positions = [i for i, x in enumerate(arr) if x == 1]
        operations = 0
        for i in range(1, len(chips_positions)):
            operations += chips_positions[i] - chips_positions[i-1] - 1
        print(operations)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells and the positions of the chips.
3. It calculates the gaps between consecutive chips and sums them up to get the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
