### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves where you and the computer place rooks. The rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can share the same row or column.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations for an \( n \times n \) board.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with -1 values, and `func_1` is called to populate the `dp` array using a recursive function.
   - The main loop processes each test case, calculating the number of invalid positions (`invalid`) and then using the `dp` array to find the number of valid configurations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - The `dp` array is used to store the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are defined as `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger \( n \), the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Test Case Handling**:
   - For each test case, the number of invalid positions is calculated by adding the unique rows and columns used by the rooks.
   - The number of valid configurations is then determined using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the number of valid configurations for the board.
   - The handling of invalid positions ensures that only valid configurations are counted.
   - The use of modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after the specified moves.

**Correctness: True**
