Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard. Specifically, the program uses a precomputed dynamic programming array `dp` which does not account for the specific constraints and requirements of the problem.

The `dp` array is initialized with values for smaller board sizes, but it does not dynamically adjust based on the actual size of the board (`n`) and the number of invalid positions (`len(invalid)`). The formula used in the `func_1` function is also incorrect for calculating the number of configurations.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to consider the remaining valid positions on the board after accounting for the invalid positions due to the rooks placed so far. The correct approach would involve calculating the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows and columns, taking into account the mirrored placements by the computer.

Here's a brief outline of what the correct solution should do:
1. Track the rows and columns that are already occupied.
2. Calculate the number of valid rows and columns left.
3. Use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
4. Apply the modulo operation as required.

Since the provided program does not implement this logic correctly, it fails to produce the correct results for various test cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
