Output State: **`dp[1]` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n for each move i, and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
