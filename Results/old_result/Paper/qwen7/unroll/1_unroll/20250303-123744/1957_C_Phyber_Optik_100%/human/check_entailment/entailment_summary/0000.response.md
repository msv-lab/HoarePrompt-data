Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer. The key observation here is that the number of available positions decreases as more rooks are placed, and the remaining positions form a smaller sub-board.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for boards of various sizes up to \( n \). This is done through the `func_1` function, which fills the `dp` array according to the given recurrence relation.

3. **DP Array Calculation**: The `dp` array is filled such that `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board without any two rooks attacking each other. The recurrence relation used is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This correctly models the combinatorial nature of placing non-attacking rooks.

4. **Handling Invalid Moves**: For each test case, the program identifies invalid positions (those already occupied by rooks) and calculates the size of the remaining valid sub-board. The number of configurations for this sub-board is obtained from the `dp` array.

5. **Final Configuration Count**: The final count of configurations is derived from the `dp` array value corresponding to the size of the remaining valid sub-board. This is correctly calculated as `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The dynamic programming approach ensures that the precomputed values are accurate, and the final calculation is performed correctly based on the remaining valid positions.

Correctness: **True**
