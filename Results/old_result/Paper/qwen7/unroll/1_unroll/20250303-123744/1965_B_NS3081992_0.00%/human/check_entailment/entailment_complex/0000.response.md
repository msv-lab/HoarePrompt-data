Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads an integer from standard input. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to read input.
   - **func_2()**: Reads a map of integers from standard input. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to read multiple integers separated by spaces.
   - **func_3()**: Reads a list of integers from standard input. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to read two integers `n` and `k`.
   - **func_4()**: Generates a list of test cases based on the number of rows. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.
   - **func_5()**: Reads a line from standard input and removes the trailing newline character. This function is correctly implemented but is not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - **func_6()**: Reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and decodes it from bytes to a string. This function is correctly implemented but is not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - **func_7()**: Reads a line of space-separated integers from user input. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to read input.
   - **func_8()**: Generates a list of test cases based on the number of rows. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to handle multiple test cases.
   - **func_9()**: Reads a string from user input. This function is correctly implemented but is not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - **func_10()**: Reads an integer from user input. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirement to read input.
   - **func_11()**: Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This function is correctly implemented but is not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - **func_12()**: Implements a recursive function to find the minimum value. This function is not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - **func_13()**: Implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD. This function is not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - **func_14()**: Constructs a sequence `a` based on the values of `n` and `k`. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirements.
   - **func_15()**: Prints the sequence `a` for each test case. This function is correctly implemented and matches the problem's requirements.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
     - For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - For `k = 1`, it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8]` if `n = 2`, otherwise it generates a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - For `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and subsequent powers of 2 up to the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The sequence generated by `func_14()` satisfies the conditions of the problem:
     - There is no subsequence with a sum of `k`.
     - All other integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) have subsequences that sum to them.

Given the analysis, all functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
