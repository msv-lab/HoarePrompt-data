Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is a list containing `[2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)], 2 ** (lk - 1) - k + 1`**, `lk` is the length of `bk`.

Explanation: The code appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`. Here, `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in the list `[2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)]`, which is \(2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + \ldots + 2^{lk-2} = 2^{lk-1} - 1\). Therefore, `k - 1 - (2^{lk-1} - 1) = k - 2^{lk-1} + 1`. Since `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`, \(2^{lk-1} - 1\) is the largest number with `lk` bits, which is `k - 1` when `k` is exactly one less than a power of two. Thus, the appended value is `k - 1 - (k - 2^{lk-1} + 1) = 2^{lk-1} - k + 1`.
