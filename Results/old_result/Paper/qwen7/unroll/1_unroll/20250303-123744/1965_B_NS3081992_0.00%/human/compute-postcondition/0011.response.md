Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i`, `2`, `l`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from 2 (inclusive) and goes up to `l` (exclusive).
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be less than `l`.
   - Since `i` starts from 2, `l` must be greater than 2.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` should be 2.
   - The value of `l` must be greater than 2.

4. **Consider Other Given States**:
   - `ans` is [2, 3].
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is 1 and remains an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `n` is not equal to 2.

Given these points, the relevant states to adjust are `i` and `l`.

Therefore, the final state to ensure the loop can execute is:

**State: `i` is 2, `l` must be greater than 2**
