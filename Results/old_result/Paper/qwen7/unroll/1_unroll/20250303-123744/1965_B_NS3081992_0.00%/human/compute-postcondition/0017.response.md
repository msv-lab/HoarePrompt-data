Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `b`, `k`, `bk`, and `l` remain unchanged from their initial states.
