Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions defined are not directly used in the main logic, but they are part of the template and do not interfere with the core functionality.
2. **Main Logic (`func_14`)**: This function is responsible for generating the sequence `a` for each test case.
   - It first converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - If `k` is 1, it handles a special case where `n` is 2.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `a` by ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k` while including all other integers from 1 to `n`.
3. **Output Handling (`func_15`)**: This function processes each test case by calling `func_14` and writing the result to standard output.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the logic in `func_14` correctly generates sequences that meet the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
