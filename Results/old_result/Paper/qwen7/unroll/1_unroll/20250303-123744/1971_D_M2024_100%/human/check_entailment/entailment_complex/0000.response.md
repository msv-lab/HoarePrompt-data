Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cuts to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.
2. The annotated program correctly identifies the number of "01" and "10" pairs in the binary string.
3. If there are no "01" pairs (`cut0 == 0`), the minimum number of cuts required is equal to the number of "10" pairs plus one. This is because we can cut after each "10" pair and place the "0" at the end.
4. If there are "01" pairs, the minimum number of cuts required is the sum of the counts of "01" and "10" pairs. This is because each "01" pair indicates a boundary where a cut is necessary to separate the "0" from the "1".

Given the logic in the program matches the requirements of the problem, the annotated program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
