Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `t`. It must be set to a value within the specified range (1 to 500 inclusive) to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive**
