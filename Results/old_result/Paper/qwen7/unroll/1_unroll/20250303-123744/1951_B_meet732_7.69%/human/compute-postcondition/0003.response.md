Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `n` is the length of the list `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i < n`, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 initially and `n` is a positive integer.
   - The value of `x` and `c` are not relevant to the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**.
