Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. After executing the loop, the output will contain "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the condition provided, with the sum of the values of n over all test cases not exceeding 2 \cdot 10^5.
