### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if we can make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that reduces three specific elements of the array.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation involves reducing `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - For the operation to be effective, the elements involved must be such that they can be reduced to zero through repeated applications.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the first element (`a[0]`) is odd and the second element (`a[1]`) is not `a[0] + 2`, it's impossible to reduce them both to zero.
   - Similarly, if the last element (`a[n-1]`) is odd and the second last element (`a[n-2]`) is not `a[n-1] + 2`, it's also impossible to reduce them both to zero.
4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly checks if the first and last elements meet the criteria mentioned above.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the given code matches the problem requirements.
   - It handles the edge cases correctly by checking the first and last elements.
   - The rest of the array elements are not checked individually but the conditions for the first and last elements are sufficient to determine the possibility of making all elements zero.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
