Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases through an external loop or input mechanism. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a result based on the relationship between `n`, `k`, and `t`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing integers `n`, `k`, and `t`. The function processes these integers according to their constraints and returns a result for each test case.
