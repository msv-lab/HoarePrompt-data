Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` which will store the number of cards to be placed at each step.
   - It calculates the number of cards to place at each step by determining how many numbers are of the form `i * odd_number` where `odd_number` is an odd number.
   - Specifically, it calculates `m = (n + 1) // 2` which gives the number of odd numbers up to `n`. This value is subtracted from `n` and appended to `L`.
3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - It initializes `tot` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards placed and `pow` to keep track of the multiplier for the current step.
   - It iterates over the list `L` and checks if the current `k` falls within the range of cards to be placed at the current step.
   - If `k` is within the range, it calculates the actual card number using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` and prints it.
   - It updates `tot` and `pow` accordingly.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly identifies the k-th card laid down by Vladislav according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
