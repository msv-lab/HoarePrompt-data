Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the loop processes each test case. For each test case, the loop calculates a sequence of integers \(L\) based on the value of \(n\), and then determines and prints an integer based on the value of \(k\) and the cumulative sum \(tot\). Specifically, it prints \(pow \times (2 \times (k - tot) - 1)\) when the condition \(tot < k \leq tot + a\) is met, where \(a\) is an element of \(L\), and \(pow\) is updated at each iteration of the inner loop.
