You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

            tot += a
            pow *= 2
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each iteration of the outer loop, the program processes the values of `n` and `k` provided by the user input, constructs a list `L` based on the value of `n`, and then calculates and prints an integer based on the value of `k` and the elements in `L`. The printed integers represent the result of the condition `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` for the specific `k` value within the range defined by the accumulated sum `tot` and the elements of `L`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards. Specifically, the program calculates the number of cards that can be laid down at each step but does not correctly determine which card is laid down at the k-th position.

Let's consider the example given in the problem description where \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 7 \):

- The first step is to lay down all the odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7.
- The second step is to lay down all cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6.
- The third step is to lay down all cards that are three times an odd number: 4 (since 3*1 = 3, but 3 has already been laid down).
- The fourth step is to lay down all cards that are four times an odd number: 8 (but 7 is the last card and we need to find the 7th card).

The program calculates the number of cards laid down at each step but does not correctly determine the sequence of cards. For instance, when \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 7 \), the correct answer should be 4, but the program does not produce this result.

To fix this, the program needs to keep track of the current position and the sequence of cards laid down, ensuring that it correctly identifies the k-th card in the specified order.
