Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic.
2. In `func_1`, the intention seems to be to replace each character in the encoded string `s` with its corresponding character from the sorted list of unique characters. However, the implementation is flawed:
   - The function attempts to replace characters directly within the string `s` using `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`, which is incorrect because `replace` operates on the entire string, not individual characters.
   - The logic for updating `j` and inserting characters into `unique_chars` is also incorrect and unnecessary for the decoding process.
3. The state comments indicate that `i` is 0 and `j` is -1 after the loop, which means the function returns an empty string, which is clearly incorrect for any valid input.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly decode the encoded string.

Correctness: **False**
