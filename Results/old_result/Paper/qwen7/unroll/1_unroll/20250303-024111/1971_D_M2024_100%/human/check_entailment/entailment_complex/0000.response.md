Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by counting the occurrences of "01" and "10" substrings in the binary string.
3. If there are no "01" substrings, it correctly prints the count of "10" substrings plus one. This is because each "10" substring indicates a place where a cut is needed to separate a "1" from a "0".
4. If there are "01" substrings, it prints the sum of the counts of "01" and "10" substrings. This is also correct because each "01" substring indicates a place where a cut is needed to separate a "0" from a "1", and each "10" substring similarly indicates a place where a cut is needed.
5. The logic in the program matches the requirements of the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
