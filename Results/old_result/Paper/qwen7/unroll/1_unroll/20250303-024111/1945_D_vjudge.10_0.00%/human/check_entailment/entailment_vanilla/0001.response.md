Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`max_p`), and the lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` people.
   - It iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` to calculate the cost of moving to positions within the allowed range.
     - If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost.
   - After calculating the cost for positions within the allowed range, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to `1` to ensure the minimum cost is achieved.
     - If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost.
     - Otherwise, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the calculated cost to the `custos` list and prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits the strings into lists of integers.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems to be correct. It ensures that Kirill pays the minimum possible amount by considering both `a_values` and `b_values`.
   - The program iterates through the list in reverse order to find the minimum cost path to the desired position.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when Kirill needs to move to the very first position by adding `a_values[0]` to the cost if necessary.
   - The logic for breaking out of the loop when the minimum cost is found is also correct.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears that the logic and handling of the input/output are correct. The program follows the problem statement accurately and computes the minimum cost as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
