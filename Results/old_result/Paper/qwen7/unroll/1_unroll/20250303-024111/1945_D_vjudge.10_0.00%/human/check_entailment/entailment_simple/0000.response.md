### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`x`) and processes each test case individually. It reads `n` and `m` for each test case, which are the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position for Kirill, respectively.

2. **Data Structures**: The program uses lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the values of `a` and `b` for each test case. This is done correctly.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The first loop calculates the cost for moving Kirill to positions from `num_fila-1` to `max_p-1`. This part checks if it's cheaper to move Kirill to the current position by paying `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`.
   - The second loop calculates the cost for moving Kirill to positions from `max_p-1` down to `1`. It checks if it's cheaper to move Kirill to the previous position by paying `a_values[y-1] + b_values[y]` or just `a_values[y]`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly appends the calculated cost for each test case to the list `custos` and prints each cost on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `y == 1` and ensures that the final cost is calculated correctly.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to follow the problem statement correctly and performs the necessary calculations to determine the minimum cost for Kirill to be within the first `m` positions in the queue.

### Correctness:

**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
