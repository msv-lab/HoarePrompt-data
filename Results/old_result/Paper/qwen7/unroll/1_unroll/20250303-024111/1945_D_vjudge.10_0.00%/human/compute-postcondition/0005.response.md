State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `custos` is a list containing the sum of selected values from arrays `a` and `b` based on specific conditions, `c` is the first element in the list `custos`**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `c` is being initialized to the first element of the list `custos`.
- For the loop to execute, the list `custos` must contain at least one element.
- The initial value of `c` will be the first element of `custos`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should reflect that `custos` is a non-empty list and `c` is set to the first element of this list.
