State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `custos` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop `for i in range(x):` to execute, `x` must be a non-negative integer. Since `range(x)` generates numbers from 0 to x-1, `x` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run at least once.
- The initial state of `t`, `x`, and `custos` does not directly affect the loop's execution but is provided as context. The key adjustment needed is ensuring `x` is greater than 0 so that the loop can start.

Thus, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (unchanged)
- `x` is an input integer, and `x` must be greater than 0
- `custos` is an empty list (unchanged)
- `i` is 0 (initial value for the loop)
