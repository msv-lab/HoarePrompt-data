Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. It then reverses the list, counts occurrences of each element in the original list, and maps these counts to characters from the alphabet list `alp`. Finally, it prints a string composed of these mapped characters for each test case.**
