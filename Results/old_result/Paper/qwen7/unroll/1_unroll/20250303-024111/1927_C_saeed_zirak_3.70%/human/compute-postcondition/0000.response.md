Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t`.
2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and the initial value of `t` is within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)), we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to start.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is simply ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
