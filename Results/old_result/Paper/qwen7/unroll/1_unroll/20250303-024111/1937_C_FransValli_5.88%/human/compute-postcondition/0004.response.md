Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) and implicitly a permutation \( p \). For each test case, it determines two integers \( k \) and \( best \) by querying the relative positions of elements in the permutation. Specifically, \( k \) is chosen to minimize the sum of absolute differences \( |k - i| \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \), and \( best \) is chosen similarly but relative to \( k \). Finally, it outputs the values of \( k \) and \( best \) for each test case.**
