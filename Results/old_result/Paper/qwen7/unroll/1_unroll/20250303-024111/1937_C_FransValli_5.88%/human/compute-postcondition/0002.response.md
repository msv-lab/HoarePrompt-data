Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. After executing the loop, k is the integer that minimizes the value of the expression `|k - i|` for all `i` from 1 to n-1, and best is the integer that minimizes the value of the expression `|best - i|` for all `i` from 1 to n-1, with the constraints that `k` and `best` are determined through the given queries.
