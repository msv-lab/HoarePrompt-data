### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

1. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is correctly defined to handle the conversion of 24-hour time to 12-hour time.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` representing the time in 24-hour format.

3. **Hour Conversion Logic**:
   - The hour part `h` is extracted from the string `s`.
   - If `h` is `'00'`, it is correctly converted to `'12'` because midnight in 24-hour format is `00:00` and in 12-hour format it is `12:00 AM`.
   - If `h` is between `'01'` and `'12'`, it remains the same.
   - If `h` is greater than `'12'`, it is correctly converted by subtracting `12` and adding a leading zero if necessary. For example, `'13'` becomes `'01'` and `'23'` becomes `'11'`.

4. **AM/PM Determination**:
   - The program correctly checks if the hour is greater than or equal to `'12'`. If true, it prints `'PM'`; otherwise, it prints `'AM'`.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints the formatted time in the 12-hour format followed by either `'AM'` or `'PM'`.

### Example Walkthrough:
- **Input**: `09:41`
  - Hour: `'09'` (which is less than `'12'`)
  - Output: `09:41 AM`
- **Input**: `18:06`
  - Hour: `'18'` (which is greater than `'12'`)
  - Output: `06:06 PM`
- **Input**: `12:14`
  - Hour: `'12'`
  - Output: `12:14 PM`
- **Input**: `00:59`
  - Hour: `'00'` (which is `'12'` in 12-hour format)
  - Output: `12:59 AM`
- **Input**: `23:59`
  - Hour: `'23'` (which is greater than `'12'`)
  - Output: `11:59 PM`

### Edge Cases:
- **Midnight (`00:00`)**: The program correctly converts `'00'` to `'12' AM`.
- **No Leading Zeroes**: The program correctly handles hours like `'01'` and `'11'` without leading zeroes when necessary.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and follows the logic for converting 24-hour time to 12-hour time. It also formats the output correctly.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
