Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing a transformed time string based on the input time. For each test case, if the input time starts with "00", it will be printed as "12" followed by the rest of the time string (e.g., "12:mm"). If the hour part (h) is less than or equal to "12", it will be printed as is, followed by the rest of the time string. If the hour part is greater than "12", it will be adjusted by subtracting 12 and prefixed with "0", followed by the rest of the time string, and then either "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is 12 or greater.
