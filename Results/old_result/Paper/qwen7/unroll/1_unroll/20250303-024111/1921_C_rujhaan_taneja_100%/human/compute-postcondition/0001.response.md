State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(test_cases):` will execute as long as `test_cases` is a positive integer and less than or equal to \(10^4\).
2. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.
3. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `test_cases` must be within the specified range (greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)), and `i` should be initialized to 0.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)
- `i` is 0
