Output State: The program will execute `test_cases` number of iterations based on the input provided in each iteration. For each iteration, it will process two lines of input: the first line contains integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and additional elements for the list `m`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the list `arr`. The program then checks if the sum of certain transformed elements in `arr` plus a base value is less than `f`. If true, it prints 'Yes', otherwise 'No'. After all iterations, the output state consists of `test_cases` lines, each containing either 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition evaluated in each iteration.
