The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers within the range [1, 2 * 10^6] and `b` is not zero. Depending on the value of `b`, the function either returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` unchanged, or it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b` to compute `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. In both cases, the function returns three values: `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`.
