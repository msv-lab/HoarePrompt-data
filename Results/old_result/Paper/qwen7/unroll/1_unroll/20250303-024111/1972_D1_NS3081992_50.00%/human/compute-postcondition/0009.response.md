Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m` where 0 <= n <= len(a) and 1 <= m <= max(a), and an integer `k` where k >= 0. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and increases any element less than `m` by the difference `m - a[i]`. If `k` remains non-negative after this adjustment, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.**
