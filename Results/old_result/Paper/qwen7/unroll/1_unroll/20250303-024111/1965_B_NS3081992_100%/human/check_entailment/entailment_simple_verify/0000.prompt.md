You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, if `lk` is 3 (for example, if `k` is 2), the loop will run twice, appending `2 ** 0` and `2 ** 1` to `ans`, resulting in `[1, 2]`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `lk`, the general form is provided as `[1, 2, 4]` assuming `lk` is 3.

        #
        #In this output state, the list `ans` has been extended with additional elements. Specifically, starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` equals 1, then `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `ans` is extended to include elements from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for all test cases. Specifically, the function `func_14()` attempts to generate a sequence, but it does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while ensuring that all other integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.

For example, consider the test case `n=8` and `k=8`. The generated sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` does not meet the requirement because the subsequence `[8]` sums to `8`, which violates the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.

Additionally, the sequence generated might not cover all integers from 1 to `n` excluding `k`. For instance, in the test case `n=9` and `k=3`, the generated sequence `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` does not include `1`, which means there is no subsequence that sums to `1`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
