Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.**

Explanation: The code `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the string `bk` (which is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to the variable `lk`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the length of `bk` is stored in `lk`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
