### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of size at most 25.
   - The sequence must not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all values `v` from 1 to `n` where `v != k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code defines several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_14`), but these functions are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_14` and `func_15`.

3. **Examining `func_14`:**
   - This function takes two arguments `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` and `k` to binary representations.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where `n` is 2.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans` based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`.

4. **Constructing the Sequence:**
   - For `k == 1`:
     - If `n == 2`, it returns "1\n2".
     - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 starting from 2.
   - For `k > 1`:
     - It initializes `ans` with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k - 1`.
     - It includes `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum `k-1` is possible.
     - It includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to handle specific cases.
     - It appends remaining powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

5. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic ensures that the sequence does not include `k` and covers all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.
   - The constructed sequence meets the problem requirements.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code provides detailed states and transitions for each function, confirming that the sequence construction logic is correctly implemented.
   - The sequence generation logic in `func_14` is consistent with the problem description and the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence `a`. The sequence construction logic ensures that the sequence does not include `k` and covers all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
