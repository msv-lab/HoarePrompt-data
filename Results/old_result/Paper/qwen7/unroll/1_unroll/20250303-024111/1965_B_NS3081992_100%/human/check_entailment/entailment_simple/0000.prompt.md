Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

        #
        #Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = lk - 2`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Therefore, if `lk` is 3 (for example, if `k` is 2), the loop will run twice, appending `2 ** 0` and `2 ** 1` to `ans`, resulting in `[1, 2]`. However, since the problem statement does not specify the exact value of `lk`, the general form is provided as `[1, 2, 4]` assuming `lk` is 3.

        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: Output State: `ans` is [1, 2, 4, k + 1, 2 * k + 1, 2 ** lk, 2 ** (lk + 1), ..., 2 ** (l - 1)], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.
        #
        #In this output state, the list `ans` has been extended with additional elements. Specifically, starting from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
    #State: Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` equals 1, then `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `ans` is extended to include elements from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns the length of ans followed by its elements separated by spaces. The length and elements depend on the conditions given for k and the binary representation of n and k.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables `func_10` and `func_14` are defined within this function, and their behavior and inputs are not specified. Additionally, the variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable to iterate over the range returned by `func_10()`.
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output state is a series of newline-separated values produced by `func_14()` for each iteration of the loop, with the number of iterations equal to the value returned by `func_10()`(). Each value is the result of calling `func_14()` and printed using `sys.stdout.write`.
