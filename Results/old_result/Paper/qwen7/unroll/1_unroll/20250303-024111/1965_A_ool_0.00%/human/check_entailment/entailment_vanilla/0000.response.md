### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice' because Alice can always remove one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1, and then Bob will be forced to remove one stone from each pile, eventually leading to Alice winning.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, it proceeds to check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between any two consecutive sizes is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The boolean variable `A` toggles its value in each iteration of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winning condition based on the differences between the sizes of the piles.
   - The approach is sound and aligns with the Nim game strategy, where the key is to ensure that the XOR of the pile sizes is non-zero for a winning position.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like multiple piles of the same size and different sizes appropriately.
   - The logic correctly identifies when Alice can force a win by making the smallest pile size 1.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
