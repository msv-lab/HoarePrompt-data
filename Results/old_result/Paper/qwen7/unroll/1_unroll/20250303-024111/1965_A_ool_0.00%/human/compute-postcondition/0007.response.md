Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `arr[0]` equals 1; `set_` is a list containing sorted unique elements from `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `set_.sort()` sorts the list `set_` in ascending order. Since `set_` contains unique elements from `arr`, sorting it does not change its content but arranges the elements in ascending order. The initial conditions of `arr` and `set_` remain unchanged except that `set_` is now sorted.
