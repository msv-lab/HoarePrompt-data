You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If so, it immediately returns 'Alice' because Alice can always remove one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1, and then Bob will be forced to remove one stone from each pile, eventually leading to Alice winning.
   - If the smallest pile has exactly one stone, it proceeds to check the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes.
   - It uses a loop to iterate through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between any two consecutive sizes is greater than 1. If such a difference exists, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The boolean variable `A` toggles its value in each iteration of the loop.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

3. **Optimal Play Consideration**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the winning condition based on the differences between the sizes of the piles.
   - The approach is sound and aligns with the Nim game strategy, where the key is to ensure that the XOR of the pile sizes is non-zero for a winning position.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like multiple piles of the same size and different sizes appropriately.
   - The logic correctly identifies when Alice can force a win by making the smallest pile size 1.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
