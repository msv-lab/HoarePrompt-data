Output State: **`not_c` is True, `arr` is a list of integers, `set_` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`.**

Explanation: The variable `not_c` was initially `False`. The code `A = not A` changes the value of `A` (which is `not_c`) to the opposite of its current value. Since `not_c` was `False`, after executing `A = not A`, `not_c` becomes `True`. The lists `arr` and `set_` remain unchanged.
