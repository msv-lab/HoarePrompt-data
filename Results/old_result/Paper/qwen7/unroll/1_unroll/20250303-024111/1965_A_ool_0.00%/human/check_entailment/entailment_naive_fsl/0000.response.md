Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the fact that the game continues until a player cannot make a move, and it incorrectly determines the winner based on the sorted unique values of the piles.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2
3
2 2 2
2
1 1
```
- Expected Output:
```
Alice
Bob
```
- Actual Output:
```
Alice
Alice
```

In the first subcase, Alice can choose \( k = 2 \) and remove 2 stones from each pile, leaving all piles empty, thus winning the game. However, the function `func_1` returns 'Alice' because the smallest value in the sorted unique set is not 1, which is incorrect.

In the second subcase, both piles have 1 stone, and after Alice's turn, both piles will be empty, so Bob wins. The function `func_1` also incorrectly returns 'Alice', which is wrong.

Therefore, the program does not handle the game logic correctly and fails to determine the winner accurately for certain inputs.
