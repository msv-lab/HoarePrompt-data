Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a transition video plan for a video game such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear, regardless of the order in which scenarios are played. At most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided.

2. **Key Components of the Code**:
   - The code initializes lists `a` and `b` to count the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' respectively.
   - It reads the input and populates these lists.
   - It then categorizes indices into `sa` and `sb` based on whether `a[i]` or `b[i]` is non-zero.
   - Depending on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`, it decides how to fill the remaining undecided ('?') values in the input matrix.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The logic correctly identifies which indices should be filled with 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' already decided.
   - The condition `if (len(sa) >= len(sb)):` ensures that if there are more undecided 'F' videos, they are prioritized over 'S' videos.
   - The loop that replaces '?' with 'F' or 'S' ensures that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type is met.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the case where the number of undecided 'F' videos is greater than or equal to the number of undecided 'S' videos.
   - It also handles the reverse case where the number of undecided 'S' videos is greater or equal.
   - Given the constraints \(2 \leq n \leq 24\) and the guarantee that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transitions are decided, the logic should work correctly for all valid inputs.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The code appears to correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the problem constraints.
   - It ensures that the generated transition video plan meets the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type, regardless of the order of scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
