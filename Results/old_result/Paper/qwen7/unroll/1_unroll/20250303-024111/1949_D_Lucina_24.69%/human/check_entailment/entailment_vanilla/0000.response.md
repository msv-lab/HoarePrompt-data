### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires creating a transition video plan for a game with \( n \) scenarios.
   - Each transition video can be either funny (F) or scary (S).
   - The goal is to ensure no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation of the scenarios.
   - The input provides a partially filled matrix where some values are known (F, S, or ?), and the rest need to be filled.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the input and initializes two arrays `a` and `b` to count the number of F and S transitions starting from each scenario.
   - It then processes the input to populate these counts.
   - It identifies scenarios that are already decided (either all F or all S) and stores them in `sa` and `sb`.
   - Based on the number of undecided scenarios (`?`), it decides whether to prioritize F or S.
   - For each scenario with undecided transitions, it generates a new string `nx` by checking the existing values and filling in '?' with F or S based on the prioritization logic.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the arrays and reads the input.
   - **Counting Transitions**: The counting mechanism works correctly.
   - **Deciding Prioritization**: The logic for deciding whether to prioritize F or S is based on the number of undecided scenarios, which seems correct.
   - **Generating the Final Plan**: The code fills in the undecided transitions correctly by ensuring no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive F or S.

4. **Verification**:
   - The code handles the constraints correctly and ensures that the generated plan meets the requirement of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive F or S for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The logic for handling undecided transitions and ensuring the constraint is met is sound.

### Conclusion:
The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It handles the input, counts the transitions, and fills in the undecided transitions while ensuring the constraint is met.

**Correctness: True**
