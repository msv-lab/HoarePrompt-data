Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which ranges from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the beginning of the loop.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Given that `n` is an input integer where `2 ≤ n ≤ 24`, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within this range.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sa`, `sb`) do not affect the loop's execution directly, but they should be in a valid state for the loop to proceed correctly.

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to be `1`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1**
