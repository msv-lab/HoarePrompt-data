Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the existing list `a`. Therefore, `a` remains a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, and `b` becomes a new list of the same length filled with zeros.
