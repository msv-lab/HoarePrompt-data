The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It processes an input consisting of n lines, where each line contains n characters representing the partial transition video plan between scenarios. The characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video needed). It is guaranteed that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, and all other characters are undecided (?).

Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of n lines, each containing n characters representing the partial transition video plan between scenarios. It determines the number of undecided characters and ensures that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided.**
