You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers representing the scores of three players, sorted non-decreasingly. It processes each test case to determine the number of draws between the players based on their scores. If the total points are odd or exceed the maximum allowed points, or if the highest score exceeds half the total points, it records `-1` for that test case indicating an invalid scenario. Otherwise, it calculates and records the number of draws. Finally, it returns a list of results where each element is the number of draws for each valid test case, and `-1` for invalid cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: 
   - The program uses a list `cas_de_test` to store the test cases, which is hardcoded. This approach is fine if the number of test cases is fixed and small (as in this case, where `t = 7`). However, if the number of test cases can vary, this method would need to be adjusted to read from standard input or another source.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws.
   - It first checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even. If not, it immediately returns `-1` because an odd total points cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) by dividing the total points by 2.
   - Next, it checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because these conditions violate the constraints of the problem.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the points distribution among the players considering the possibility of draws.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`.

### Analysis of Provided Test Cases:
- **Case (0, 0, 0)**: No games, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Case (0, 1, 1)**: One draw between the second and third player. Correct output: `1`.
- **Case (0, 2, 3)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Case (3, 3, 3)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Case (3, 4, 5)**: Six draws. Correct output: `6`.
- **Case (1, 1, 10)**: Two draws between the first and second player, and four draws between the first and third player. Correct output: `2`.
- **Case (0, 0, 6)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and test cases.

### Correctness:
