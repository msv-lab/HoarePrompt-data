Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers representing the scores of three players, sorted non-decreasingly. The function returns a list of results where each element is the number of draws for each valid test case, and -1 for invalid cases.**
