Output State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players in each test case, sorted non-decreasingly such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is a list containing the number of equal matches for each valid test case, and -1 for invalid cases.
