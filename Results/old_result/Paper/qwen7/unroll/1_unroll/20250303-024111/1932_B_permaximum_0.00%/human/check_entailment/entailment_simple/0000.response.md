Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the year when all \( n \) signs will occur sequentially, starting from the first sign.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases \( t \) and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of signs \( n \) and their periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
4. The variable `year` is initialized to 0 before processing each test case.
5. In the loop, `year` is updated using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`, which ensures that `year` is always a multiple of the current periodicity \( ai \) and accounts for the sequential occurrence of signs.
6. After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final value of `year` is printed, which represents the year when the \( n \)-th sign will occur.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
