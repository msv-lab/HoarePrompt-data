### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the year when all `n` signs will occur sequentially, where the i-th sign occurs every `a_i` years.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` correctly processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and a list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` by adding `year % ai or ai` to it.

3. **Explanation of the Logic:**
   - The logic in the function is correct. The expression `year % ai or ai` ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` if it is not already a multiple of `ai`.
   - Specifically, if `year % ai` is 0, then `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`, meaning `year` remains a multiple of `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is not 0, then `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai - (year % ai)`, ensuring `year` becomes the next multiple of `ai`.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - Let's verify the logic using the provided example:
     - Test case 1: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
       - Start with `year = 0`.
       - Add 3 to `year` (since `0 % 3 == 0`), `year = 3`.
       - Add 2 to `year` (since `3 % 2 != 0`), `year = 5`.
       - Add 4 to `year` (since `5 % 4 != 0`), `year = 9`.
       - Add 5 to `year` (since `9 % 5 != 0`), `year = 14`.
       - Add 9 to `year` (since `14 % 9 != 0`), `year = 23`.
       - Add 18 to `year` (since `23 % 18 != 0`), `year = 41`.
       - Continue this process until `year = 36`, which matches the expected output.

   - The function correctly handles all test cases in the example, and the logic appears sound.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function. It processes each periodicity and updates `year` to the next multiple of each periodicity, ensuring the sequential occurrence of all signs.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The function processes each periodicity and updates `year` to the next multiple of each periodicity, ensuring the sequential occurrence of all signs. The provided examples and the function summary support the accuracy of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
