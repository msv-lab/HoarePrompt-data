Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
3. **Year Calculation**: It iterates through each periodicity `ai` and updates the `year` variable. The key logic here is:
   - If `year % ai == 0`, then the next sign will occur in exactly one more year (`year + ai`).
   - Otherwise, the next sign will occur at the next multiple of `ai` after `year`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated year for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the year when all signs will occur sequentially, as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
