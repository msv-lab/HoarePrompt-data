You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` integers representing the value of `year` calculated from the given loop for each input test case. Each integer corresponds to the sum of the series where each term is the minimum of the previous term and the current element in the list `a`. The value of `n` and the list `a` change with each iteration based on user input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through a series of constraints where t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive). The function does not return a specific value but rather processes these inputs according to given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
