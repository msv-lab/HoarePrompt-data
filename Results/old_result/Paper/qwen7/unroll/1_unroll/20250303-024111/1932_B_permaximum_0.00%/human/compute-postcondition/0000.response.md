Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `t` is equal to the input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the input is an integer, the new value of `t` is the input integer, which still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
