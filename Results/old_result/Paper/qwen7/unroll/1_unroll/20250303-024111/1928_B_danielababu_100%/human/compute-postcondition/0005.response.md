Output State: **The program returns the list 'ans' where each element is the product of all elements from the end of 'arr' to the current index, starting from the last element.**

This means that if `arr` is a list of positive integers, `ans` is constructed such that `ans[i]` is the product of all elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[-1]`. The function returns this list `ans`.
