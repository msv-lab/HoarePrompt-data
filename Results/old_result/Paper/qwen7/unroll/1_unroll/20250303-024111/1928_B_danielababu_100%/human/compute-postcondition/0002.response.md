Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `len(arr) - 1`, `-1`, and `-1` (the range parameters).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and run correctly. This means `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`, and the condition `i >= 0` should hold true initially.

Given these points, let's formulate the required state adjustments:

- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `ans` is an empty list.
- `tem` is 1.
- `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The condition `i >= 0` must hold true initially.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, and `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**.
