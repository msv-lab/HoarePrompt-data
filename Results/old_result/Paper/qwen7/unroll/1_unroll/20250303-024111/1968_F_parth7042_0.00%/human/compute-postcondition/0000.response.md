Output State: **t is a positive integer, data is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer. The new variable `data` is created and assigned the result of the split operation.
