Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50), m (an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5), and a (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G').

    Args:

            - m (int): Number of upcoming rounds.

For each test case, if the frequency of any character in the string `a` is less than `m`, the difference is added to the `missing` count, and this count is appended to the `results` list.

    #The program returns a list `results` containing the number of missing characters for each test case after executing the loop. For each test case, if the frequency of any character in the string `a` is less than `m`, the difference is added to the `missing` count, and this count is appended to the `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the number of missing characters for each test case. For each test case, it checks the frequency of each character in a given string `a`. If the frequency of any character is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds this difference to the `missing` count. This count is then appended to the `results` list. The function returns a list `results` containing these counts for all test cases.
