Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black). It also accepts two positive integers t, n, and m, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the total number of characters (n * m) does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns information based on the grid configuration and the values of n, m, and t.**
