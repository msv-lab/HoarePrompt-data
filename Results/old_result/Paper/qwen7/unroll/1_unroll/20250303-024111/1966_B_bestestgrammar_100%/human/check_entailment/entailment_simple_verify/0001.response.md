### Reasoning

The original assessment is indeed incorrect. Let's break down why the provided solution is flawed and provide a more comprehensive analysis.

#### Flaws in the Original Solution

1. **Horizontal and Vertical Checks:**
   - The program checks if the first row and last column are consistent horizontally and the first column and last row are consistent vertically. While these checks are necessary, they are not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it is impossible to make all squares the same color. This is true, but the program fails to consider other configurations that can still achieve uniformity.

2. **Insufficient Coverage:**
   - The program does not account for all possible configurations of the grid. There are many scenarios where the grid can be made uniform even if the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors. For example, a checkerboard pattern can sometimes be converted to a uniform color.

3. **Counterexamples:**
   - Counterexample 1: A 2x2 grid with `WW` and `BB`. The program returns 'NO', but it can be made uniform by selecting the top-right and bottom-left cells.
   - Counterexample 2: A 2x2 grid with `WB` and `BW`. The program returns 'YES', but it cannot be made uniform with the given operations.

#### Correct Approach

To determine if the grid can be made uniform, we need to check if there exists a single color that can be propagated throughout the grid using the allowed operations. One effective way to do this is to check if all rows or all columns are the same color.

Here is a revised approach:

1. **Check Rows:**
   - For each row, check if all elements are the same. If any row has mixed colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

2. **Check Columns:**
   - Similarly, for each column, check if all elements are the same. If any column has mixed colors, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform.

3. **Final Decision:**
   - If all rows or all columns are uniform, the grid can be made uniform. Otherwise, it cannot.

### Revised Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        gr = []
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        # Check rows
        for i in range(n):
            if len(set(gr[i])) > 1:
                ans = 'NO'
                break
        
        else:
            # Check columns
            for j in range(m):
                col = ''.join([gr[i][j] for i in range(n)])
                if len(set(col)) > 1:
                    ans = 'NO'
                    break
            else:
                ans = 'YES'
        
        print(ans)
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was incorrect because the provided solution did not account for all possible configurations of the grid. The revised approach ensures that the program correctly determines if the grid can be made uniform.

**Final: True**
