Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc` and the value `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `tc` is less than `t`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `tc`**: By default, when the loop starts, `tc` is set to 0 (as is typical for Python's `range` function).

4. **Determine the requirement for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `tc` must be less than `t`. Since `tc` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The initial state of `t` is given as an input integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
