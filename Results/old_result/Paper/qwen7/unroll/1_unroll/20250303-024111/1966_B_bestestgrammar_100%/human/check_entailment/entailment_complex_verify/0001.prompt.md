You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: Output State: t is an input integer, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing all iterations of the loop, the variable ans is set to 'YES' unless there is a condition where the first element of the first row does not match the last element of the last row, and it's impossible to make all corresponding elements equal by swapping columns or rows.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented by `n` rows and `m` columns containing 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to make the top-left element of the grid equal to the bottom-right element by swapping any number of rows or columns. If such swaps can make the elements equal, the function outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function reads the number of test cases `t`, followed by the dimensions `n` and `m` and the grid configuration for each test case, and prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It also correctly reads the grid itself, storing it in a list of strings `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program assumes that if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have different colors, it is impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - This assumption is correct because if the corners have different colors, no operation can make them the same without affecting other parts of the grid.

3. **Checking Horizontal Consistency:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the first row are the same.
   - If they are not, it further checks if all elements in the last column are the same.
   - If both checks fail (i.e., the first row and last column are inconsistent), it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - These checks are necessary but not sufficient. They only cover specific patterns and do not account for more complex configurations.

4. **Checking Vertical Consistency:**
   - Similar to the horizontal check, the program checks if all elements in the first column are the same.
   - If they are not, it further checks if all elements in the last row are the same.
   - Again, if both checks fail, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - These checks are also necessary but not sufficient.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case based on the value of `ans`.

### Detailed Explanation of Correctness

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks specific patterns and does not account for all possible configurations of the grid. Here are some counterexamples:

- **Counterexample 1:** Consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
  ```
  WW
  BB
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, so the program would incorrectly return 'NO'.
  - However, by selecting the top-right and bottom-left cells, all cells can be made the same color.

- **Counterexample 2:** Consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
  ```
  WB
  BW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, so the program would return 'YES'.
  - However, this configuration cannot be made uniform with the given operations.

### Conclusion

The program's logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible configurations of the grid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
