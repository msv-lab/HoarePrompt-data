Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` and constructs the grid `gr`.
3. It then checks if the top-left element (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right element (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are different, it sets `ans` to 'NO' and exits the loop for that test case.
4. If the top-left and bottom-right elements are the same, it further checks if all elements in the first row and the last column are the same. If they are not, it also sets `ans` to 'NO'.
5. If no conditions to set `ans` to 'NO' are met, it leaves `ans` as 'YES'.
6. The logic correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares the same color by swapping rows and columns, as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
