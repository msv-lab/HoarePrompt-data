You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])

        print(''.join((str(x) for x in new)))
        print(''.join((str(x) for x in new2)))

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits, each of which is the result of processing two input strings of digits through the given loop. For each position in the strings, the first string (new) contains the maximum value between the corresponding digits of the two input strings if they are not equal at that position or the last digit that was found to be different, otherwise it contains the minimum value. The second string (new2) is the reverse, containing the minimum value if the digits are not equal or the last different digit, otherwise it contains the maximum value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two input strings of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It compares the corresponding digits of the two strings and constructs two new strings based on the comparison results. For each position where the digits are different, the first new string contains the maximum value, and the second new string contains the minimum value. If the digits are the same, the new strings retain the original digits. The function prints these two new strings and does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their digits. The logic in the program does not ensure that the largest possible digits are swapped to maximize the product. Instead, it attempts to align the larger digits from `a` and `b` but does not fully consider the optimal strategy for maximizing the product.

For example, consider the input:
```
2
98
12
```

The program outputs:
```
98
12
```

However, the optimal solution would be to swap the digits to get:
```
92
18
```

This results in a higher product (92 * 18 = 1656) compared to the original (98 * 12 = 1176). Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the product in this case.
