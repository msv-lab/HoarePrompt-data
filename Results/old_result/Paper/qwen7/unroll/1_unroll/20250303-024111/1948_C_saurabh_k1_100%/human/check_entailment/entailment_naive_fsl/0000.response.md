Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions for odd indices and does not consider the full movement rules of the robot. Here's an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and can move to (1, 2) and then follow the arrow to (2, 2). From (2, 2), the robot can move to (2, 3) and then follow the arrow to (1, 3). Finally, from (1, 3), the robot can move to (1, 4) and then follow the arrow to (2, 4).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'No' because it only checks the condition for odd indices and does not fully simulate the robot's movement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
