Reasoning:
The provided code attempts to solve the problem by checking for specific conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n). However, the logic implemented in the code is flawed. Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the dimensions (`n`) and the two rows of arrows (`a` and `b`).

2. **Condition Check**: The code checks for a specific condition within the loop: 
   ```python
   if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
       print('No')
       break
   ```
   This condition checks if there is a conflict at position `i` where the arrow in the first row points left and the arrow in the second row at the next or previous position also points left. If such a conflict exists, the code immediately prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Else Block**: If no conflicts are found, the code prints 'yes'. However, this is not the correct approach to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

The provided solution does not account for the full path the robot might take. Instead, it focuses on a single condition that could prevent the robot from moving. This is insufficient because the robot can potentially navigate around such conflicts using other cells.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n). The provided code does not do this.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
