You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4; for each value of `t`, there is a corresponding `n` and two strings `a` and `b` such that after executing the loop, if for every `n` and corresponding `a`, `b`, the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is never met for any odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, then 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'No' is printed for that particular `n`, `a`, and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings of length `n` where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether it's possible to move from the first row to the second row following the arrows without any conflicts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
