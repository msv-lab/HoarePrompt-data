Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book for each test case. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns the total number of pages for each test case.**

This means the function will take a series of test cases as input, where each test case consists of a number of books and their respective page counts, and it will return the total number of pages for each test case.
