Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The logic to determine the \(k\)-th card laid down by Vladislav is flawed. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The code does not correctly handle the sequence of laying down cards as per the problem statement. For example, it incorrectly skips some steps and does not follow the exact sequence of multiples of odd numbers.

2. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The variable `s` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down but is not updated correctly.
   - The variable `d` is used to decrement but its usage is not aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The logic for determining the \(k\)-th card is overly complex and does not follow the described process.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to follow the exact sequence described:

1. Lay down all odd-numbered cards.
2. Lay down all cards that are twice an odd number.
3. Lay down all cards that are three times an odd number.
4. Continue this process until all cards are laid down.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while True:
            # Number of odd numbers up to i
            num_odds = (i + 1) // 2
            if count + num_odds >= k:
                break
            count += num_odds
            i += 1
        
        # Determine which specific card is k-th
        offset = k - count - 1
        odd_number = 1
        multiplier = i
        kth_card = 2 * (offset + 1) * multiplier - 1
        print(kth_card)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for each test case.
