You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \( y \) based on the given conditions involving \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it computes \( y \) using a specific formula involving binary operations and arithmetic. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process of laying down the cards. Specifically, the program fails to handle the correct order of laying down the cards for certain values of `n` and `k`.

For instance, consider the test case `n = 7` and `k = 7`. According to the problem description, the sequence of cards laid down should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4. However, the program incorrectly calculates the 7th card as 4 instead of 4, which is the correct 7th card in the sequence.

Let's break down the issue:
- For `n = 7`, the sequence of cards laid down should be:
  1. Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
  2. Numbers that are twice an odd number: 2, 6
  3. Numbers that are three times an odd number: None
  4. Numbers that are four times an odd number: 4

The program attempts to calculate the position using a formula that does not accurately reflect the described process. The formula used in the program is not correctly implementing the logic of laying down the cards in the specified order.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the described process for all potential cases, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
