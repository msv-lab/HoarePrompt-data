Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m` and returns a list of these products, with the list itself reversed.**
