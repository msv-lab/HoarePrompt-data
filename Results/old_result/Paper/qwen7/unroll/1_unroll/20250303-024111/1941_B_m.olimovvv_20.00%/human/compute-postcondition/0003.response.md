Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) representing the size of an array `a`, and the array `a` consisting of `n` integers (where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case, either the sum of elements in array `a` or an error message if the sum exceeds a certain limit or if any other condition is not met.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers, and performs operations based on the specified constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
