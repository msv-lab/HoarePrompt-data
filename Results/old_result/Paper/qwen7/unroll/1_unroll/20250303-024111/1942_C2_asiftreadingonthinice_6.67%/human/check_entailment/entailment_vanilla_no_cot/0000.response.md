Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The logic for counting triangles is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2` and the handling of edge cases are incorrect. The code assumes that every pair of consecutive chosen vertices that are two apart forms an additional triangle, which is not always true.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The edge case where the first and last chosen vertices are two apart is handled incorrectly. The condition `if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2` should be checked, but the subsequent logic is incorrect.

3. **Redundant and Incorrect Code:**
   - The variable `tmp` is not used correctly and the logic inside the loop where `tmp` is appended is incorrect. The condition `y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1` is also incorrect and redundant.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation of `ans` and the use of `min(ans, n - 2)` might not be correct in all scenarios.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for _ in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate initial number of triangles using the chosen vertices
        ans = x - 2
        
        # Check for additional triangles between consecutive chosen vertices
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]
            if gap >= 3:
                ans += gap // 2 - 1
                y -= max(0, (gap // 2 - 1))
        
        # Check for additional triangles involving the first and last chosen vertices
        gap = (a[0] + n - a[-1]) % n
        if gap >= 3:
            ans += gap // 2 - 1
            y -= max(0, (gap // 2 - 1))
        
        # Add remaining chosen vertices as triangles
        ans += min(y, n - x)
        
        print(ans)


# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of triangles is calculated correctly by considering gaps between chosen vertices and handling edge cases properly.
