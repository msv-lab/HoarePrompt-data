### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the list of chosen vertices `a`.

2. **Sorting and Initial Calculation**:
   - The chosen vertices `a` are sorted.
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This accounts for the minimum number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and any additional vertices.

3. **Processing Adjacent Chosen Vertices**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find gaps of even length between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - For each gap of length `gap` (where `gap` is even), it calculates how many additional triangles can be formed by adding vertices in the middle of the gap.
   - The variable `tmp` keeps track of these gaps, and `ans` is updated accordingly.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program checks the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, treating them as if they were adjacent (by wrapping around the polygon).
   - If this gap is even, it similarly calculates how many additional triangles can be formed.

5. **Final Adjustment and Output**:
   - The remaining available vertices `y` are added to `ans`.
   - The final answer is capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Analysis:

- The logic for handling gaps between chosen vertices and the edge case of wrapping around the polygon seems correct.
- The calculation of additional triangles by adding vertices in the middle of gaps appears to be accurate.
- The final adjustment to account for the remaining available vertices `y` is also correct.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
