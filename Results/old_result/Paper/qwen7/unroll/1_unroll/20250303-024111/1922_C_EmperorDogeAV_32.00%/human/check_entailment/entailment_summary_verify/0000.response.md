Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to understand why the original assessment might be incorrect.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city based on the given conditions. Here is the function again for reference:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        forward = 99999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

#### Issues with `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Closest City**: The function does not correctly identify the closest city. It compares the absolute differences but does not ensure that the closest city is unique and correctly identified based on the problem description.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Distances**: The function does not handle the distances correctly. For example, for the cities `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`, the closest city to city 1 should be city 2, but the function might incorrectly set `prog_cities[0]` to 1 instead of the distance `8`.

### Correct Approach

To correctly identify the closest city, we need to ensure that for each city, we find the city with the smallest distance to it. This can be done using a simple loop to find the minimum distance for each city.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    closest_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        min_distance = float('inf')
        closest_city_index = -1
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(cities[j] - cities[i]) < min_distance:
                min_distance = abs(cities[j] - cities[i])
                closest_city_index = j
        closest_cities[i - 1] = min_distance
    return closest_cities
```

### Analysis of the Main Program

The main program uses the results from `func_1` to compute prefix sums for forward and backward directions. These prefix sums are used to calculate the minimum cost for each query. The logic for handling queries seems correct, assuming the closest cities are correctly identified.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original assessment is incorrect because the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city. The `func_1` function needs to be corrected to properly identify the closest city for each city. Once the function is corrected, the main program logic should work correctly.

Final: **False**
