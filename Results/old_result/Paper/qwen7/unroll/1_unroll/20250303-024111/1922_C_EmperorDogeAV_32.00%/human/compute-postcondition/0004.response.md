Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, depending on which difference is smaller.**

This means that for each city in the list `cities`, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` will be 1 if the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and the next city's coordinate is greater than 1. Otherwise, it will be the actual absolute difference. The function returns the list `prog_cities` as is, without any further modification.
