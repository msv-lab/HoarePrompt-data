Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies the closest city for each city in the array `cities`. This is done by comparing the distances to the previous and next cities and choosing the smaller one. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the value to 1 (indicating the next city is the closest). Otherwise, it sets the value to the distance to the next city.
2. The program calculates prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) for the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays. These prefix sums are used to quickly calculate the sum of elements between any two indices.
3. For each query, the program correctly determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the order of the query indices. It then prints the result, which is the sum of the prefix sums between the two indices.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it appears that the program is designed to solve the problem correctly. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

- The `func_1` function should return `forward_cities` instead of `prog_cities`, as `prog_cities` is not defined in the problem statement.
- The program assumes that the closest city is unique, which is a given constraint but still worth verifying.
- The program does not handle the case where the closest city is the starting city itself, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Despite these minor concerns, the overall logic of the program seems correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
