Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost includes traveling to the closest city (cost = 1) and traveling directly between any two cities (cost = distance).

2. **Key Components:**
   - `func_1` function calculates the cost to travel to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays store these costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - `func_1` is intended to compute the cost to travel to the next closest city but seems to be implemented incorrectly.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because:
     - It uses `-99999999` and `99999999` as placeholders, which might not work as expected.
     - It doesn't properly handle the closest city logic.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are computed correctly.
   - The queries are processed correctly using the prefix sums.

4. **Testing with Example:**
   - Let's test the `func_1` function with the example provided:
     - Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
     - Expected output for `func_1` should be `[8, 4, 3, 5]` (costs to reach the next closest city).
     - The actual output is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly compute the closest city costs.
   - The rest of the code handles the queries correctly once the costs are computed.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because the `func_1` function is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
