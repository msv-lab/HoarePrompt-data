cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 10^5 representing the number of queries. Each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i such that 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.
