Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error. The function `func_1` tries to use a bitmask to determine how to group the numbers, but it does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Bitwise XOR Operation**: The code uses `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` to flip all bits of `num`. This operation is not necessary for solving the problem. Instead, what you need to do is to create a bitmask where each bit represents whether a particular bit position across all numbers is set or not.

2. **Counting Bit Positions**: You should maintain a count of the number of times each bit position (from 0 to 30) is set across all numbers. If at any point, more than one number has the same bit set at a particular position, you need to start a new group.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, a):
    # Initialize a list to keep track of the count of set bits at each position
    bit_counts = [0] * 31
    
    # Iterate through each number
    for num in a:
        # Check each bit position from 0 to 30
        for i in range(31):
            if (num >> i) & 1:
                bit_counts[i] += 1
                
    # The maximum count of set bits at any position gives the minimum number of groups needed
    max_count = max(bit_counts)
    
    return max_count
```

This function correctly counts the number of times each bit position is set across all numbers. The maximum count of set bits at any position determines the minimum number of groups required because each group can have at most one number with a set bit at any position.
