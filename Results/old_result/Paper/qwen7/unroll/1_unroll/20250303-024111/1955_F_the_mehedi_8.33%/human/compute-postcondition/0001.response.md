Output State: The value of `cnt` is calculated based on the input provided in each iteration. For each test case, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, and then `cnt` is further incremented by half the count of each number in the input, rounded down. The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed.
