Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of indices greater than the previous one encountered, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_B = []` initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, or `B`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
