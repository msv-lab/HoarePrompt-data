Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the expected behavior as described in the problem statement.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid.
   - The pinball starts at each cell and moves left or right based on the character ('<' or '>').
   - After each move, the direction of the current cell is reversed.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid and the string representing the directions.
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function calculates two arrays, `A` and `B`, which store cumulative sums of indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - These cumulative sums help in determining the time taken for the pinball to reach the boundaries of the grid.
   - The function then uses these cumulative sums to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the reversal of directions.
   - The cumulative sums (`A` and `B`) are computed correctly.
   - The final calculations for the time taken to leave the grid are also correct based on the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary or where the grid is completely filled with one type of direction ('<' or '>').
   - The logic ensures that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps, as required by the problem statement.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
