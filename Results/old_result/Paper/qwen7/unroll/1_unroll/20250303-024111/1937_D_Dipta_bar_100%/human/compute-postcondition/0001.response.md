Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `A`. The initial state of `s` and `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `A` is now an empty list.
