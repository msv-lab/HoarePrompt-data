Output State: `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of indices greater than the previous one encountered, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is a list of integers calculated based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of '<' characters in `s`. 

In the loop, for each index `i` from `n-1` to `0`, if `s[i]` is '<', we append `0` to `B` if `idx_B` is empty. Otherwise, we calculate `x` as `B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)` and append `x` to `B`. We also append the current index `i` to `idx_B`.
