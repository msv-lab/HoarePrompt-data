Output State: **`sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`; `n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of n monsters, and `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the n monsters, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second; `distance` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `distance` to 0. This does not affect the values of `sorted_indices`, `n`, `a`, `x`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
