You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance attribute of infoA and the balance attribute of infoB.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence. The balance of `infoA` is equal to the balance of `infoB`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects with attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). It returns the difference between the `balance` attribute of `infoA` and the `balance` attribute of `infoB` if their balances are not equal. If their balances are equal, it returns the difference between the `position` attribute of `infoB` and the `position` attribute of `infoA`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance value, index `i`, and character `s[i]` for each iteration; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (where result is a string containing the characters from the `character` attribute of each `BalanceInfo` object in the `balance_info` list, sorted by balance value in ascending order and by position in descending order for objects with the same balance value)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", verifies that it forms a valid balanced parentheses sequence, and prints a new string where the characters from `s` are rearranged according to their balance value and position. Specifically, the characters are sorted first by their balance value in ascending order and then by their original positions in descending order among those with the same balance value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to implement a function `func_2` that performs the "balanced shuffle" operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the balance of each prefix, sorting based on this balance, and then reconstructing the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic but seems to be a helper function for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - **Initialization**: 
       - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
       - `balance_info` is initialized as an empty list to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - `balance` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current balance.
     - **Building Balance Info**:
       - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
       - For each character, a `BalanceInfo` object is created and appended to `balance_info`.
       - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it's ')', the balance is decremented.
     - **Sorting**:
       - `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function that sorts based on the balance and position in descending order for tie-breaking.
     - **Reconstructing the Result**:
       - The sorted `balance_info` is used to construct the result string by joining the characters from the `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - The result is printed.

3. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted based on the specified criteria.
   - The reconstruction of the result sequence is done correctly by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.
