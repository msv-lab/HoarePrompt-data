Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range function argument `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` represents the length of the string `s`, which is a constant value.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `balance_info` is an empty list.
   - `balance` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < n`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is derived from the length of `s`.
   - The states of `balance_info` and `balance` do not affect the loop's execution and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` remains as the length of `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s`**
