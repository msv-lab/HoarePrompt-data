### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallets.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If both players play optimally, the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by mirroring Alice's moves (i.e., swapping when Alice doesn't swap, and vice versa). This ensures that Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can mirror Bob's moves similarly, ensuring she will be the last to make a move.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly checks the parity of `a + b`.
   - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This function is logically sound and correctly implements the game's winning condition based on the parity of the total number of coins.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results as expected.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
