### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - Each player alternates turns.
   - On each turn, a player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallets.
   - After choosing, the player removes one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If both players play optimally, the game essentially boils down to the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`).
   - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by mirroring Alice's moves (i.e., swapping when Alice doesn't swap, and vice versa). This ensures that Bob will be the last to make a move.
   - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can mirror Bob's moves similarly, ensuring she will be the last to make a move.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function correctly checks the parity of `a + b`.
   - If `a + b` is even, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `a + b` is odd, it returns 'Alice'.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1` to determine the winner, and stores the result.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.
