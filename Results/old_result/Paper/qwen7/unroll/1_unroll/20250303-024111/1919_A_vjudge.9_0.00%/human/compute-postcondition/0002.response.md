State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), results is an empty list, _ is not relevant as it is a placeholder index**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment since it is not used outside the loop.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` represents the number of iterations, it must be a positive integer within the specified range for the loop to execute.
- The variable `results` being an empty list is a prerequisite for the loop but does not affect whether the loop itself executes. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `results`.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
