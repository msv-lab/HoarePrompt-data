Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the set `us`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each element in the set `us`, the initial value of `i` should be one of the elements in `us`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `us`**: The set `us` contains the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

4. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `us` to iterate over.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is an element of `us` and that `us` is initialized correctly. 

Here is the state that needs to be adjusted:

- `i` should be one of the elements in `us`.
- `us` should contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

Since the loop will execute as long as there are elements in `us`, we don't need to specify a particular value for `i` but rather ensure that `us` is properly initialized.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is an element of `us`, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets**.
