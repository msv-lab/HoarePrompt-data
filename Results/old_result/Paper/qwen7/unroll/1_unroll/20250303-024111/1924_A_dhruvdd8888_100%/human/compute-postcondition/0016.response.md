Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints and conditions involving test cases (t), where for each test case, it checks if a given string (s) of length m, consisting of the first k lowercase English alphabets, can form a sequence of length n using only these alphabets. If such a sequence can be formed for all test cases, the function prints 'YES'.**
