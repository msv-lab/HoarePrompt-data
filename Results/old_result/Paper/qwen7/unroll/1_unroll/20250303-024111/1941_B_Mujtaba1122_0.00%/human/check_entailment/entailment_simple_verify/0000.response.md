### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **inaccurate**. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to understand why.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. This is a straightforward check and works correctly.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function attempts to transform the list by applying the specified operations until no further operations can be applied. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Loop through indices from 1 to n-2**:
   - For each index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), the function checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
   - If these conditions are met, it applies the operation:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` (this is redundant as it subtracts the same value from itself)
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`

2. **Reduction Logic**:
   - The operation reduces `list[i]` by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` by itself, and `list[i+1]` by the value of `list[i-1]`.
   - This effectively reduces the value of `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]` and distributes the reduction to `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]`.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop continues until no further operations can be applied, meaning that for every `i` in the range `1 < i < n-1`, the conditions `list[i] > 1` and `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0` are not satisfied simultaneously.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, `func_1(list, n)` is called to check if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES".
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "NO".

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_2` correctly applies the operations as described in the problem statement.
- The loop ensures that all possible reductions are made.
- The final check with `func_1` ensures that the list is fully reduced to zeros if possible.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero. The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the transformation process.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
