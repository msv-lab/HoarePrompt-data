Output State: The list will be modified such that for every element `list[i]` (where 1 < i < n-1), if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. This process continues until no more reductions can be made according to the conditions. All elements outside the range 1 to n-2 will remain unchanged.
