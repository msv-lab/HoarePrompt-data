### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and reducing three elements in the array: \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function checks if the list contains any non-zero elements. If it finds any non-zero element, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. However, the provided explanation suggests that the function incorrectly returns `True` if the list contains no zero elements, which is not aligned with the expected behavior.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to reduce the elements of the array using the specified operation. It iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible. After attempting to apply the operation, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: The function should return `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise. However, the provided implementation returns `True` if there are no non-zero elements, which is incorrect.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The logic of applying the operation and checking if all elements are zero is correct. However, the issue lies in `func_1`, which is not correctly implemented.

Given that `func_1` is not correctly implemented, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

### Conclusion:
Since the provided implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, the entire program cannot be considered correct.

**Correctness: **False**
