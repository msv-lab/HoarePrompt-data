State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array `a`, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `i` is 1, `i` must be less than `n - 1`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(1, n - 1):`.
2. The loop variable `i` starts at 1 and increments until it is no longer less than `n - 1`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be initialized to 1 and `i` must be less than `n - 1`.

Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `i` is 1 and `i` is less than `n - 1`. The other variables (`list` and `n`) are already correctly described in the given state.
