Output State: The list will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop.
