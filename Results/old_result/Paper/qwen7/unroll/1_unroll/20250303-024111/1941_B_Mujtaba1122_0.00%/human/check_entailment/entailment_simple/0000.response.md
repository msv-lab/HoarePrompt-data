### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether it's possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calls a function `func_2` which performs the required operations on the array.
   - `func_2` iterates through the array and applies the operation as long as certain conditions are met.
   - After processing, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if there are any non-zero elements in the list.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function applies the operation as long as the conditions are met.
   - It ensures that the operation can only be applied if the current element and its neighbors have sufficient values.
   - After applying the operation, it checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The code correctly handles the transformation of the array based on the given operation.
   - The final check using `func_1` ensures that the array is made entirely zero if possible.

### Conclusion:

The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this goal accurately.

### Correctness:

**True**
