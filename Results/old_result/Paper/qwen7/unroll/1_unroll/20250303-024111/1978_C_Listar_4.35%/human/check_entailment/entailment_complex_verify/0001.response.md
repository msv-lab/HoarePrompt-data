### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given code step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if a solution exists.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if no solution exists.
   - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
   - If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
   - If \( k \) exceeds these maximum values, it returns `(0, 0)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs the permutation.
   - It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves the last element to the front until the required Manhattan value is achieved.
   - The logic seems to decrement \( k \) by the index positions as it moves elements.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It takes a list `l` as input and prints it.

5. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a solution exists.
   - If a solution exists, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.
   - If no solution exists, it prints "NO".

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 1 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "NO" because \( k = 1 \) cannot be achieved.
   - **Original Assessment:** Incorrect. The function should return "NO".

2. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "YES" with the permutation `[1]`.
   - **Original Assessment:** Correct.

3. **General Case:**
   - For larger \( n \) and \( k \), the function should correctly construct a permutation if one exists.
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It attempts to decrement \( k \) by the index positions, which does not always lead to a valid permutation.
     - For example, consider \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 5 \). The function should construct a permutation like `[4, 1, 2, 3]` with a Manhattan value of 5.
     - However, the current implementation may not always achieve this.

### Testing and Edge Cases

1. **Testing with \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 5 \):**
   - Expected output: "YES" with the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
   - Actual output: The function may not produce the correct permutation.

2. **Testing with \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \):**
   - Expected output: "NO" because the maximum possible Manhattan value for \( n = 4 \) is 6.
   - Actual output: The function may incorrectly return a permutation.

### Conclusion

The code has significant logical issues, particularly in `func_1`, where the permutation construction logic is flawed. The function does not always produce a valid permutation for given \( n \) and \( k \).

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
