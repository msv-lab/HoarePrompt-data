### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If so, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating that no valid permutation exists for an odd `k`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a given `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iteratively modifies the list by moving the last element to the front if `k` is greater than zero and the condition `1 + i > k` holds.
   - After processing, it returns the modified list `l`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It prints an empty line at the end.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `k` is odd, `func_2` correctly returns `(0, 0)`, which should lead to printing "NO".
  - When `n` is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) is calculated correctly, and if `k` exceeds `max_k`, `(0, 0)` is returned, leading to printing "NO".
  - When `n` is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is calculated as `n^2 // 2`, and if `k` exceeds this value, `(0, 0)` is returned, leading to printing "NO".

- **Permutation Generation**:
  - `func_1` constructs the permutation correctly by moving the last element to the front in a way that satisfies the Manhattan value requirement.
  - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the permutation generated has the desired Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all edge cases and generates the correct permutations for valid inputs. Therefore, the given program is correct.
