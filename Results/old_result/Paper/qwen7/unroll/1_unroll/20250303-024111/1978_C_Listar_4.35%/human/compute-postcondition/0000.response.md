Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `n, k = func_2()` has been called.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_2()` calls the function `func_2()` and assigns its return values to `n` and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_2()` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `k` directly. However, we know that `n` will be an integer within the range 1 to 2·10^5, and `k` will be an integer within the range 0 to 10^12. The initial conditions for these variables remain valid, and they are now assigned the values returned by `func_2()`.
