Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`; `l` is passed as an argument to `func_3(l)`**.

Explanation: The code calls `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the return value of `func_1(n, k)`. Since the function call itself does not modify any variables outside of its scope, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `l` is updated to be the return value of `func_1(n, k)`, and it is passed as an argument to `func_3(l)`.
