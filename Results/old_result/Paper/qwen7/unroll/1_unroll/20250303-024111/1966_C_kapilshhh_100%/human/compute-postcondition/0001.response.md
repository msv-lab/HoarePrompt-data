State right before the while loop: `tc` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and all other variables are unchanged.

```
while tc > 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The loop condition is `tc > 0`.
- For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.
- Since `tc` is described as an input integer and the problem states that all other variables are unchanged, the only state that needs adjustment is `tc`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
