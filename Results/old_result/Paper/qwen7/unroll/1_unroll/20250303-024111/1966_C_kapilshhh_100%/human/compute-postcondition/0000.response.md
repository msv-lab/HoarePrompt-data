Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and all other variables are unchanged.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tc`). This integer is converted to an integer type using `int()`. All other variables remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
