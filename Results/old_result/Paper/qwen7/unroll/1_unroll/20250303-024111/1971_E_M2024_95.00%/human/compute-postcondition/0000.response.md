Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `k`, and `q` are integers such that `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ `k`, `q` ≤ 10^5, and the sum of `k` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `a` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ `n` and `a_i` < `a_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k-1`, and `a_k` = `n`. `b` is a list of `k` integers where 1 ≤ `b_i` ≤ 10^9 and `b_i` < `b_{i+1}` for every 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k-1`. `d` is a list of `q` integers where 0 ≤ `d` ≤ `n`. `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been updated to the integer input provided by the user, while all other conditions and lists remain unchanged.
