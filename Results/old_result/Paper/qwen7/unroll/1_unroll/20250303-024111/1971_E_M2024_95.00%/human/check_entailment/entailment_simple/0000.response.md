Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input values for the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
2. It initializes the lists `a` and `b` with the known points and times, respectively, and calculates the distances between these points (`ad` and `bd`) and the speeds between these points (`v`).
3. For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment of the number line where the query point `ql` lies.
4. If `ql` is exactly at one of the known points, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
5. Otherwise, it calculates the time taken to travel from the previous known point to `ql` using the speed of the segment.
6. The output format matches the expected format, providing the time for each query rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
