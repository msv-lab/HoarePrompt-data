Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Given the initial state: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, and `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`t` must be at least 1**

This ensures that the loop will execute at least once if `t` is within the given range.
