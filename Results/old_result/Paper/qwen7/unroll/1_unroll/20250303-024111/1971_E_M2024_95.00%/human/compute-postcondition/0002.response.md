Output State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing `q` integers. For each test case, the integers represent the result of the query `ql` using the formula `m += b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]`, where `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the sorted list `a`. If `ql` is exactly equal to `a[s]`, the output is simply `b[s]`. The loop processes each test case independently, and the results are printed for each query within a test case.
