Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains some logical errors and inefficiencies. Here's why it is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program tries to calculate the MEX value for each position `i` in the array `arr`. However, the logic for calculating MEX is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the `minn` value and the `used` dictionary.
   
2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**:
   - When `arr[i]` is negative, the program calculates `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as the MEX value, which is not correct according to the problem statement. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of `p`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `used` Dictionary**:
   - The `used` dictionary is used to keep track of used values, but the logic for updating `minn` and checking for used values is incorrect. This can lead to incorrect MEX values being calculated.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to construct the permutation `p` step-by-step while ensuring that the MEX condition is satisfied. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    p = [-1] * n
    mex = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] >= 0:
            # If arr[i] is non-negative, use it directly
            p[i] = arr[i]
            mex = max(mex, arr[i] + 1)
        else:
            # If arr[i] is negative, find the smallest unused value
            while mex in p:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            mex += 1
    
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

This corrected program ensures that the MEX condition is correctly maintained and constructs a valid permutation `p` for each test case.
