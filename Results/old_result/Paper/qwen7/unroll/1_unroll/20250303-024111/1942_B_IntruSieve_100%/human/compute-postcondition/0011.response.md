Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: n, a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a, a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Given the constraints and relationships, the function likely processes a series of test cases defined by t, where each test case involves an integer n and a list of integers a. However, since no specific return value is mentioned, it implies the function might be performing some operation or validation without returning a result directly.
