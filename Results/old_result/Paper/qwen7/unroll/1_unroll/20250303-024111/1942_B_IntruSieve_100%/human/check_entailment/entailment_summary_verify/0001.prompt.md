You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It calculates a modified exclusive maximum (mex) for each element in the list based on whether the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it appends the current minimum unused non-negative integer (`minn`). If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum unused non-negative integer. The function then prints these mex values for each element in the list, separated by spaces. After processing, the function sets `minn` to 10001 and ensures that all integers from 0 to `minn-1` are marked as used in a dictionary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It sets `minn` to 0, which is the candidate for MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.

3. **Processing Each Element of Array `a`:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`, it checks if `arr[i]` is positive.
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means the MEX value should be `minn`. It appends `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `minn` is already used, it increments `minn` until it finds a free slot.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, it calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to the `mex` list, marking the calculated MEX value as used.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the `mex` list contains the MEX values for each position.
   - It prints the `mex` list, which represents the permutation `p`.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0 1 4 2 3
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2`
  - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2`

The program constructs the permutation `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0 1 2 3 4
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3]) - 3 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) - 4 = 1`

The program constructs the permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  -2 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2 0 1
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `a_1 = MEX([2]) - 2 = 0`
  - `a_2 = MEX([2, 0]) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 2`

The program constructs the permutation `[2, 0, 1]`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and matches the expected outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
