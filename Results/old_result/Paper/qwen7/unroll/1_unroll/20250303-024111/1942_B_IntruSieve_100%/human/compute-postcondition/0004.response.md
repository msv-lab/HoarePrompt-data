Output State: **`minn` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i; `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and converted to integers; `mex` is an empty list; `used` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `used`. All other variables retain their initial states.
