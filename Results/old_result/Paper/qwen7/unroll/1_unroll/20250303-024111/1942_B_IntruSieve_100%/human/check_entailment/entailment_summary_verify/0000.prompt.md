You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True
            while minn in used:
                minn += 1
        else:
            mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It calculates a modified exclusive maximum (mex) for each element in the list based on whether the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it appends the current minimum unused non-negative integer (`minn`). If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum unused non-negative integer. The function then prints these mex values for each element in the list, separated by spaces. After processing, the function sets `minn` to 10001 and ensures that all integers from 0 to `minn-1` are marked as used in a dictionary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a permutation \( p \) that satisfies the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and constructing the permutation is flawed.

Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX value but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current subarray. Instead, it uses a simple incrementing approach which may not always yield the correct MEX value.

2. **Handling Negative Values**: The program incorrectly handles negative values in the array \( a \). When \( a_i \) is negative, the program subtracts the absolute value from the current minimum non-used value, which does not align with the definition of MEX.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The program constructs the permutation by directly using the calculated MEX values without ensuring that all integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) are used exactly once.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

While the output seems correct in this case, the program does not guarantee that all integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) are used exactly once in the permutation. Additionally, the logic for calculating MEX is flawed, especially for negative values.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated approach to ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated and that all integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) are used exactly once in the permutation.
