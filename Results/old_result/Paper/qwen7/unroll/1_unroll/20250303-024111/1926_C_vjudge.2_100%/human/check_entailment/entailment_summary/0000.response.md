Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The key issue lies in the pre-computation part of the code where the array `pd` is being filled. The purpose of `pd[i]` is supposed to store the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`. However, the current implementation only accumulates the sum of digits for each number individually without considering the cumulative sum of digits up to `i`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Pre-computation Logic**: The current logic for pre-computing the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `N` is flawed. It only adds the sum of digits of the current number `i` to `pd[i]`, but it should also include the cumulative sum of digits from previous numbers.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: To correctly compute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `n`, you need to ensure that `pd[i]` includes the sum of digits from all numbers up to `i`. This requires a more sophisticated approach than simply iterating through each digit of `i`.

3. **Efficiency Consideration**: Given the constraints (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)), pre-computing the sum of digits for all numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) is unnecessary and inefficient. Instead, you can directly compute the sum of digits for each `n` during the test cases.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
