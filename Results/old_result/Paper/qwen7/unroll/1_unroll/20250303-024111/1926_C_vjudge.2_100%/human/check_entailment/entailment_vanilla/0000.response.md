Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Setup:**
   - The program initializes `N` to `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1`, which is `200001`.
   - It then creates a list `pd` of size `N` filled with zeros.
   
2. **Prefix Sum and Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - The program iterates over each number from `1` to `N-1` (i.e., from `1` to `200000`).
   - For each number `i`, it updates `pd[i]` by adding the value of `pd[i-1]` (to maintain a running total).
   - It also calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and adds this sum to `pd[i]`.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints `pd[n]`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Prefix Sum Array (`pd`):**
   - The prefix sum array `pd` is constructed such that `pd[i]` contains the sum of the digit sums from `1` to `i`.
   - This means `pd[i]` will store the sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to `i`.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - The digit sum calculation is done correctly within the loop where the digit sum of each number is added to `pd[i]`.

3. **Test Case Handling:**
   - For each test case, the program correctly retrieves the precomputed sum from `pd[n]` and prints it.

### Edge Cases and Time Complexity:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles large values of `n` up to `2 * 10^5` efficiently due to the precomputation.
  - However, the input constraints for `t` are `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, which means there could be up to `10^4` test cases. The program should handle this within the given time limit.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The initial construction of the `pd` array takes `O(N log N)` time because calculating the digit sum for each number up to `200000` is `O(log N)`.
  - Each test case query is `O(1)` since it just involves accessing the precomputed value.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and efficient for the given problem constraints.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
