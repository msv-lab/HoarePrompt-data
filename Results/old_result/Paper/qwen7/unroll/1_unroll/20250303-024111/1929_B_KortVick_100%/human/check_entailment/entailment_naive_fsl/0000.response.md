Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, consider the case where `n` is small and `k` is close to but less than `4 * n - 2`. For example, in the test case `(n=3, k=9)`, the program will incorrectly calculate the result as `5` instead of `4`.

To illustrate, let's manually check the case `(n=3, k=9)`:

- For a 3x3 grid, there are 10 diagonals in total.
- To satisfy `k=9`, we need to color cells such that 9 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The minimum number of cells needed to achieve this is 4, as shown in the following configuration:
  ```
  X . .
  . X .
  . . X
  ```
  This configuration ensures that 9 out of the 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell.

However, the program calculates:
```python
print(ceil(9 / 2))  # Output: 5
```
This is incorrect because 4 cells are sufficient, not 5.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all cases and hence is incorrect.
