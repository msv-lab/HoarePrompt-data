Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. This condition is used to handle a specific case where the number of diagonals `k` is exactly equal to the total number of diagonals in the grid.
   - If this condition is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - For a grid of size \( n \times n \), there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to consider how these diagonals are distributed.
   - The key insight is that each colored cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

4. **Special Case**:
   - When \( k = 4n - 2 \), every diagonal must have at least one colored cell. In this case, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 \). The `+1` accounts for the fact that some cells might cover both diagonals simultaneously.
   - The program correctly handles this special case by printing `k // 2 + 1`.

5. **General Case**:
   - For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells required is approximately \( \frac{k}{2} \), rounded up to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals are covered.
   - The program uses `ceil(k / 2)` to achieve this.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both the special case and the general case as per the problem requirements. The logic is sound and matches the expected output for the given examples.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
