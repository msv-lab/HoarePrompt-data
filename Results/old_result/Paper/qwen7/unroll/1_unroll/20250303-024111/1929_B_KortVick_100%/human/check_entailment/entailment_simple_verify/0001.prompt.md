You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either the result of `k // 2 + 1` or `ceil(k / 2)`, depending on whether `4 * n - 2` equals `k` for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). Each line's content depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` provided in the input for that iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if `4 * n - 2` equals `k`. This condition is used to handle a specific case where the number of diagonals `k` is exactly equal to the total number of diagonals in the grid.
   - If this condition is true, it prints `k // 2 + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - For a grid of size \( n \times n \), there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.
   - To minimize the number of colored cells while ensuring at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell, we need to consider how these diagonals are distributed.
   - The key insight is that each colored cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

4. **Special Case**:
   - When \( k = 4n - 2 \), every diagonal must have at least one colored cell. In this case, the minimum number of cells needed is \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 \). The `+1` accounts for the fact that some cells might cover both diagonals simultaneously.
   - The program correctly handles this special case by printing `k // 2 + 1`.

5. **General Case**:
   - For other values of \( k \), the minimum number of cells required is approximately \( \frac{k}{2} \), rounded up to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals are covered.
   - The program uses `ceil(k / 2)` to achieve this.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both the special case and the general case as per the problem requirements. The logic is sound and matches the expected output for the given examples.
