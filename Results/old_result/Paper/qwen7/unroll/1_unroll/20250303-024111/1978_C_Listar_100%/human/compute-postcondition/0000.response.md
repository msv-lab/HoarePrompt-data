Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `n` and `k` are the return values from `func_4()`**.

This means that the function `func_4()` has returned two values, which are assigned to `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are now determined by the function's logic, but their exact values are not specified in the given code snippet. The conditions on `n` and `k` remain unchanged, meaning `n` is still a positive integer within the range [1, 2 * 10^5] and `k` is still a non-negative integer within the range [0, 10^12].
