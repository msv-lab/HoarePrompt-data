Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation with the given Manhattan value, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, especially when `k` is odd or when `n` is odd and `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`.

For instance, consider the case where `n = 1` and `k = 1`. According to the problem description, there should be no permutation of length 1 with a Manhattan value of 1, so the output should be "No". However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly. The function `func_4` returns `(0, 0)` for this scenario, which means it incorrectly proceeds to call `func_1`, leading to an incorrect output.

Here is a specific example:
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `No`
- Actual Output: The program will attempt to generate a permutation, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
