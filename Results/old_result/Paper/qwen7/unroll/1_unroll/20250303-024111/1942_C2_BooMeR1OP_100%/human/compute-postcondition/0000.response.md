Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, after executing this line of code, `t` will still be an integer within the same range, but now it also holds the specific value input by the user. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
