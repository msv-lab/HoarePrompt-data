Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`, which is the range parameter.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is the range parameter, the loop will run `t` times.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given that `t` is initially an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it already satisfies this condition. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, which means `t` should be greater than 0.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: Since `t` is already within the valid range, no additional adjustments are needed beyond ensuring `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
