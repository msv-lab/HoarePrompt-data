Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result based on the input data for each test case.**

This means the function takes no direct parameters but reads input data from the user or another source, processes it according to the specified constraints, and returns a result for each test case.
