#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a 2D list representing the field, where each element is a string. b is an integer representing the number of steps in the game.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns a tuple containing the sum of the first row of the 2D list 'a' and the first element of 'b', and the sum of the second row of the 2D list 'a' and the second element of 'b'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list `a` where each element is a string, and an integer `b`. It converts the elements of the first and second rows of the 2D list `a` to integers, adds the first element of `b` to the sum of the first row and the second element of `b` to the sum of the second row, and returns a tuple containing these sums.
