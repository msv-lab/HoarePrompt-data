### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and the Bludger.
   - The program initializes the middle of the field and the initial state of the Quaffle.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles player movements and updates their positions.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates the player if they are in the same position.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player moves with it.
   - It correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle and throwing it into a goal.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing them.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the final score and prints it in the required format.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity given a direction.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Bludger Collision**: The program does not handle the scenario where a player is eliminated due to a collision with the Bludger correctly. Specifically, the program should check if the player is in the same position as the Bludger and eliminate the player, but it does not do so consistently. For example, the player's position update should be checked against the Bludger's position before updating the Quaffle's position.

- **Incorrect Update of Quaffle Position**: When a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle, the Quaffle should remain at the position of the player and Bludger. However, the program does not handle this correctly. The Quaffle's position should be updated only if the player is not eliminated.

- **Sorting of Eliminated Players**: The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically, but it does not handle cases where multiple players are eliminated simultaneously. The sorting should ensure that the players are sorted alphabetically and then printed in the correct order.

Given these issues, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not fully handle all edge cases and scenarios as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
