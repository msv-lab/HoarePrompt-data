Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `a` where each element is a string, and an integer `b`. It returns a tuple containing the sum of the first row of the 2D list `a` (where each element is converted to an integer) and the first element of `b`, and the sum of the second row of the 2D list `a` (where each element is converted to an integer) and the second element of `b`.**
