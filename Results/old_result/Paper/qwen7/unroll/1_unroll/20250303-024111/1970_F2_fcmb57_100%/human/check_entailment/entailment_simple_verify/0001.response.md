### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and the Bludger.
   - The program initializes the middle of the field and the initial state of the Quaffle.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles player movements and updates their positions.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_1`. The function `func_1` is intended to update the position of an entity based on a direction. But the function is incorrectly implemented. Instead of updating the coordinates, it returns the sum of the coordinates and the direction values, which is incorrect. This will lead to incorrect positions being set for the entities.
   - The program checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates the player if they are in the same position. This part seems correct.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player moves with it.
   - It correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle and throwing it into a goal.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing them.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the final score and prints it in the required format.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is incorrectly implemented. It should update the coordinates based on the direction, but instead, it returns the sum of the coordinates and the direction values. This will lead to incorrect positions for the entities.

Given the above analysis, the program has a critical flaw in the `func_1` function, which will result in incorrect positions for the entities. This will affect the entire logic of the program, leading to incorrect scoring and elimination.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function, which leads to incorrect positions for the entities, affecting the overall correctness of the program.
