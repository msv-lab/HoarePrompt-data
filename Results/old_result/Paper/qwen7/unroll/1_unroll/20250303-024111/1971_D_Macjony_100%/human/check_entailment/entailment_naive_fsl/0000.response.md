Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string has multiple segments of '0's followed by multiple segments of '1's. For example, consider the input "010011". The program will count this as needing 3 cuts, but it can actually be rearranged into a sorted binary string with just 2 cuts: "01" and "0011".

To fix this, the program needs to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', and ensure that the final piece ends with '1'. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        prev_char = s[0]
        for j in range(1, len(s)):
            if (prev_char == '0' and s[j] == '1') or (prev_char == '1' and s[j] == '0'):
                count += 1
                prev_char = s[j]
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string is calculated correctly.
