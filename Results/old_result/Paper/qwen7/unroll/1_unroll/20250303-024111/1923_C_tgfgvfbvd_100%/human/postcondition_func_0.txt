The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it handles a list of positive integers `c` and a series of queries. Each query specifies a range within the list, and the function determines whether the number of occurrences of the integer `1` in that range is at least half the length of the range plus one. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each query.
