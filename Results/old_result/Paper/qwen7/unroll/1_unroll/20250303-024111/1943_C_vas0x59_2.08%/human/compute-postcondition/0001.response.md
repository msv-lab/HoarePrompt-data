Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists, where each inner list represents the neighbors of a vertex. Since `n` is an input integer, the length of `u2vs` is `n`, and each of the `n` lists within `u2vs` is empty. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged, and the initial structure of `u2vs` is updated to reflect this new definition.
