Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its corresponding index's connected indices after processing all the edges provided through user input, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `_` is the second value returned by bfs which is not used.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the `bfs` function with the start node `0`. The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search on the graph represented by the `u2vs` adjacency list. It returns two values: `d`, which is the distance from the start node to all other nodes, and `_` (which is the second value), which is not used in the code and hence remains as the placeholder `_`. The `u2vs` list and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
