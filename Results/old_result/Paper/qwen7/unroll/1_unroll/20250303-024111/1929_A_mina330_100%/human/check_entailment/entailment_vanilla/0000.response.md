### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. Sorting ensures that the largest element is paired with the smallest element, maximizing the positive difference.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It prints the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array, which is the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has only two elements, the beauty is simply the absolute difference between these two elements.
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the beauty is still maximized by pairing the smallest and largest elements.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the maximum beauty by sorting the array and taking the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
   - This approach works for all valid inputs as per the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to maximize the beauty of the array.

**Correctness: True**
