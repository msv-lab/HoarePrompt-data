Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
2. The provided solution sorts the array `a` and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements (`a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`).
3. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible sum of these differences.
4. This approach works because the maximum beauty is achieved when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. In this case, the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n` will be the largest possible.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
