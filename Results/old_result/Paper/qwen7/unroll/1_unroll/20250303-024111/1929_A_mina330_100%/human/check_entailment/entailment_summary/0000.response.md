Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty of the array after rearranging its elements, which is defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the provided program only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array, which is not the same as the maximum possible beauty.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` while minimizing the negative ones. This can be done by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. If the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences will be maximized for the larger elements and minimized for the smaller ones.

The current implementation only finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference, which does not consider the arrangement of elements to maximize the overall beauty.

Correctness: **False**
