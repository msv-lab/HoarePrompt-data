Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if either `a` or `b` is even:
   - If `a` is even, it divides `a` by 2 and checks if the resulting halves (`a1` and `a2`) are not equal to `b`. If this condition is met, it prints "Yes".
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, it divides `b` by 2 and checks if the resulting halves (`b1` and `b2`) are not equal to `a`. If this condition is met, it prints "Yes".
4. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints "No".
5. The conditions and logic in the program align with the problem statement. Specifically, if either dimension is even, it can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, no such rearrangement is possible without creating identical rectangles.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` is correct.

Correctness: **True**
