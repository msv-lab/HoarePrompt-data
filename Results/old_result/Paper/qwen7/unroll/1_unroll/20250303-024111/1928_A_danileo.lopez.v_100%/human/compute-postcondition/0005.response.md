Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9). It returns different values based on the relationship between `a`, `b`, and `t`.**

However, since the exact return values based on the relationships between `a`, `b`, and `t` are not specified in the given output, the functionality cannot be fully detailed without additional information.
