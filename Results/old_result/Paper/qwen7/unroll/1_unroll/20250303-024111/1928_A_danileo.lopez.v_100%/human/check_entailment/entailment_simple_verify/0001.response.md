### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Checking for Even Dimensions:**
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
     - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`), both being `a // 2`.
     - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal halves (`b1` and `b2`), both being `b // 2`.

3. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - After splitting, the program checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
     - If `a1` (or `b1`) is not equal to `b` (or `a`), it prints "Yes" indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
     - If `a1` (or `b1`) is equal to `b` (or `a`), it prints "No" indicating that no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Handling Odd Dimensions:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program directly prints "No" since no even split can produce a different rectangle.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the `1x1` case by printing "No".
   - The program correctly handles the `2x1` case by printing "No".

2. **General Case:**
   - For even dimensions:
     - If `a` is even, splitting `a` into two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`) results in two smaller rectangles. If `a1` (or `a2`) is not equal to `b`, the program correctly prints "Yes".
     - Similarly, if `b` is even, splitting `b` into two equal halves (`b1` and `b2`) results in two smaller rectangles. If `b1` (or `b2`) is not equal to `a`, the program correctly prints "Yes".
   - For odd dimensions:
     - If both `a` and `b` are odd, splitting either dimension results in two odd dimensions, which cannot form a different rectangle. The program correctly prints "No".

3. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic in the program is sound. It correctly identifies when a new rectangle can be formed by checking if the split dimensions can form a different rectangle.
   - The program handles all edge cases and general cases correctly.

#### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
