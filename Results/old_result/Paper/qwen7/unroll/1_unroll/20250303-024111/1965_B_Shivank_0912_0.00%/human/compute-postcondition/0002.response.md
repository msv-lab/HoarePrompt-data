Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies `(n, k)` as the variables being iterated over using `enumerate(cases)`. This means `n` and `k` are derived from the tuples in the `cases` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `n` and `k`**: Since the loop is iterating over the `cases` list, at the start of the loop, `n` and `k` will be the first elements of the first tuple in `cases`.

3. **Check the Constraints**: The constraints for `n` and `k` are given as follows:
   - For each tuple `(n, k)` in `cases`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`.
   - For each tuple `(n, k)` in `cases`, `1 ≤ k ≤ n`.

4. **Initial State of Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `results`, and `sequence`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their initial values do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are the initial values of `n` and `k` from the first tuple in the `cases` list.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `n` and `k` are the first elements of the first tuple in `cases`.

**State:**
- `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `cases`.
- `k` is the second element of the first tuple in `cases`.

Since `cases` is a list of tuples, and we don't know the specific values of the first tuple, we can represent it generally.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is the first element of the first tuple in `cases`, `k` is the second element of the first tuple in `cases`**
