#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7.
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    sequence = [(2 ** i) for i in range(25)]
    for (n, k) in cases:
        results.append((25, sequence))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and k such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `results` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]), and `sequence` is a list containing the first 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains two integers `n` and `k` where `n` ranges from 2 to \(10^6\) and `k` ranges from 1 to `n`. The function generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the pair (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]). This list is then returned by the function.
