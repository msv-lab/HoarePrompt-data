The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains two integers `n` and `k` where `n` ranges from 2 to \(10^6\) and `k` ranges from 1 to `n`. The function generates a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the pair (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]). This list is then returned by the function.
