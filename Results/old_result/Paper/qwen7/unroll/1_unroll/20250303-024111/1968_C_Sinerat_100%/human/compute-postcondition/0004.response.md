Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates a list `a` where `a[0] = 1000` and `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` for all `1 â‰¤ i < n`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.**
