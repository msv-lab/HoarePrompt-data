Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the conditions specified in the problem. The program initializes `a[0]` to 1000 and then sets each subsequent element `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`. However, this approach does not guarantee that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

To satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`, we need to ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i`. A correct approach would be to set `a_i` to be at least `a_{i-1} + x_i` to ensure the modulo operation gives the desired result. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1  # Start with a[0] as 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] * (a[i - 1] // x[i - 1]) + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

This corrected version ensures that `a_i` is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition for each `x_i`.
