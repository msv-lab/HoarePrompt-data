Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, a is a list of n integers where a[0] = 1000 and a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] for all 1 ≤ i < n.
