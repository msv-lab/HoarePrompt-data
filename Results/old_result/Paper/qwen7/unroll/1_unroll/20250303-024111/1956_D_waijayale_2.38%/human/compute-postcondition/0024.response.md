Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters `l` and `r`, which define a subarray of the list `a`. It modifies the subarray to maximize the sum of its elements under certain conditions. If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in the subarray to \(r - l + 1\) and records the operation in the list `ops`. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray, updates `ops` with the operation, and recursively calls itself on the left and right subarrays excluding the position of the maximum element, unless the maximum element is at the boundary of the current subarray. The function does not return a value but modifies the list `a` and populates the list `ops` with the operations performed.**
