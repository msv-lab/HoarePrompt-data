Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives a list `a` of length `n` (where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 18) and each element in the list `a_i` is an integer satisfying 0 <= a_i <= 10^7. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

However, based on the context, it seems the function processes the list `a` and might return some result derived from the list elements, but no specific return type or value is mentioned in the given output cases.
