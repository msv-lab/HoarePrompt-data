Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions:**
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `recursive_maximize_sum` are defined but not used correctly. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but does not pass any operations list (`ops`), and `func_1` is not called within `func_2`.
   - The function `func_3` is supposed to handle the main logic but does not properly integrate the operations list (`ops`) into its output.

2. **Logic Errors:**
   - In `func_1`, the condition `if a[l] != 0:` should be `if a[l] != 0 and a[l] != r - l + 1:` to ensure that the operation is only performed when necessary.
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` has a logic error where it tries to maximize the sum by setting all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` if the current sum is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. This logic does not correctly maximize the sum and may lead to incorrect results.
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` does not properly handle the case where the maximum element in the subarray is already equal to `r - l + 1`.

3. **Missing Operations List:**
   - The function `func_2` does not return the operations list (`ops`). Therefore, the main function `func_3` cannot print the operations required to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The problem requires calculating the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of a subarray, which is not directly handled in the provided code.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a strategy that ensures the MEX value is calculated and used to update the array elements in a way that maximizes the sum. The provided code does not correctly implement these requirements.
