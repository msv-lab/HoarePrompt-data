Postcondition: `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive; `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7; `ops` is a list that now includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`. Additionally, the sum `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
