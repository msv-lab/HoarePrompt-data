You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. For each test case, it transforms each count to the nearest even number, checks if the first three transformed counts are all odd, and adds 1 to the result if true, otherwise adds 0. It then adds half of the sum of all transformed counts (using integer division). The function outputs a list of these results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. The program attempts to calculate the sum of the odd numbers in the first three elements of the input list and checks if this sum equals 3, but this approach is flawed. 

Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1 1 1 0
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because, in this case, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet, as the bitwise XOR of the sequence (1, 1, 1, 0) is `1 ^ 1 ^ 1 ^ 0 = 1`, which is non-zero, meaning Alice wins. The program incorrectly calculates the result based on the sum of odd numbers in the first three elements and the total sum, which does not align with the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the program considers the parity of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
