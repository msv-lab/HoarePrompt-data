You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, there are four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a series of integers resulting from the evaluation of the given loop for each test case. For each test case, the output is calculated based on the following logic:
    #
    #1. Read four integers \( p_i \) (representing counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).
    #2. Transform each \( p_i \) to its nearest even number.
    #3. Check if the first three transformed numbers (1s, 2s, 3s) are all odd.
    #4. If the condition in step 3 is true, add 1 to the result; otherwise, add 0.
    #5. Add half of the sum of all transformed numbers (integer division).
    #
    #The final output state is a list of these results for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero. Otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Sequence Composition**: The sequence consists of `p_1` ones, `p_2` twos, `p_3` threes, and `p_4` fours.
4. **Strategy**: Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins. We need to find the optimal strategy for removing numbers.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

2. **Processing**:
   - The program uses `list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` to process the input. This lambda function essentially converts each integer to either 0 or 1 depending on whether it is even or odd.
   - It then prints the result of `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Lambda Function**:
   - `int(x) - int(x) % 2` converts any integer to 0 if it is even and 1 if it is odd.
   - This is unnecessary because the input values are already integers, and we can directly use them.

2. **Summing Odd Counts**:
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` sums the counts of odd numbers among the first three types (ones, twos, threes).
   - This check is incorrect because it should be checking the parity (odd/even) of the actual numbers, not their counts.

3. **Sum of All Numbers**:
   - `sum(p)` calculates the total number of elements in the sequence.
   - `sum(p) // 2` divides this sum by 2, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the sum of the first three types is exactly 3, which is also incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the bitwise XOR of the sequence.
2. Determine the number of ways to achieve a zero XOR by removing elements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = p[0] ^ p[1] ^ p[2] ^ p[3]
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of ways to remove elements to get a zero XOR
            # This involves combinatorial logic to count valid removals
            # For simplicity, we can assume the optimal strategy involves removing elements to balance the XOR
            # Here we use a simplified approach to count the number of removals needed
            count_ones = p[0]
            count_twos = p[1]
            count_threes = p[2]
            count_fours = p[3]
            
            # Count the number of removals needed to balance the XOR
            # This is a simplified version of the combinatorial logic
            removals = min(count_ones, count_twos, count_threes, count_fours)
            print(removals)

func()
```

The given program is incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the problem and the incorrect logic used. Therefore, the correct answer is:
