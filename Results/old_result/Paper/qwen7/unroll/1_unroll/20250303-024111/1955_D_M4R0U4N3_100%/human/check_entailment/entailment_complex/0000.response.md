Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `max_val` is set to 1000000, which is large enough to cover the maximum possible value of elements in the arrays (`10^6`).
   - `cnt_b` is initialized as a list of zeros with a size of `max_val + 1`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from input.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - The frequency of each element in `b` is stored in `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - A sliding window approach is used to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - The variable `curr` keeps track of the current count of elements from `b` present in the current window of `a`.
   - As the window slides, the program adjusts the count of elements in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` accordingly.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means the current window is good, and the answer counter `ans` is incremented.

5. **Resetting for Next Test Case**:
   - After processing each test case, `cnt_b` is reset to all zeros to ensure that it starts fresh for the next test case.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments for each test case and resets the state properly for subsequent test cases.

Correctness: **True**
