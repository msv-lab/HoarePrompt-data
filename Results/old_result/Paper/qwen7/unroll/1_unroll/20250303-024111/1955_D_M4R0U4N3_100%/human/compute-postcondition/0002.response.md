Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop uses `_` as the loop variable, which is typically used as a throwaway variable when you don't care about the value inside the loop.
   - The loop also uses `int(input())` to determine how many times the loop should run.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since `_` is a throwaway variable, we don't need to adjust its state.
   - The number of iterations of the loop is determined by `int(input())`, so we need to ensure that the input value is valid and non-negative.

3. **Initial State Given:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is 1000000.
   - `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.

4. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The state `t` is already within the required range, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - The state `max_val` is fixed at 1000000, so no adjustment is needed for `max_val`.
   - The state `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros, so no adjustment is needed for `cnt_b`.

5. **Input Value for the Loop:**
   - The loop will run `int(input())` times, so we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, the input value must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
