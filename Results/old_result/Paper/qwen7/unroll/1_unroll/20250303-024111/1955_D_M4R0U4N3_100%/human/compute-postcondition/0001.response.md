Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros**.

Explanation: The code initializes a list `cnt_b` with 1000001 elements, all set to 0. This list is created using the range from 0 to `max_val` (inclusive), which is 1000000. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `max_val` also remains unchanged.
