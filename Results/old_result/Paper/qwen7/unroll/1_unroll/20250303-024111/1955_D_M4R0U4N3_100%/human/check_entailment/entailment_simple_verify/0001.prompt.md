You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #
    #Explanation: The given code processes multiple test cases within the loop. For each test case, it updates the `cnt_b` list based on the input values but resets `cnt_b` to all zeros at the end of each test case. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the `cnt_b` list remains a list of 1000001 zeros.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000 and creates a counter array `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the array `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - It iterates through `b` and increments the corresponding indices in `cnt_b`.

3. **Finding Initial Matches:**
   - It creates a set `b_values` containing the unique elements of `b`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 and `curr` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if they are in `b_values`.
   - If an element is found in `b_values`, it decrements the corresponding index in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative.

4. **Checking Initial Condition:**
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It then uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent subsegments of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element entering the window (`a[i + m]`), it increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` if the count becomes positive.
   - For each element leaving the window (`a[i]`), it decrements the corresponding index in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` if the count becomes non-negative.
   - If `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k` after these updates, it increments `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counters:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counters in `cnt_b` for the next test case.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input reading and initialization.

2. **Counting Matches:**
   - The counting logic for the initial segment and the sliding window is correct. It ensures that only relevant elements are considered and updated.

3. **Sliding Window Logic:**
   - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly. It efficiently updates the counts and checks the condition for each new subsegment.

4. **Resetting Counters:**
   - The counters are reset correctly before processing the next test case, ensuring no carry-over from previous test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
