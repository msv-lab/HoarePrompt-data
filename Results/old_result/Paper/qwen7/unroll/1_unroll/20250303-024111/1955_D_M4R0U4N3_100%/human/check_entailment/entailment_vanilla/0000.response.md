Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It reads the array `a` of size `n` and the array `b` of size `m`.

2. **Counting Occurrences of Elements in `b`:**
   - A list `cnt_b` is initialized with zeros up to `max_val + 1`.
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in `b` and stores these counts in `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - It initializes `curr` to count the number of elements in the current window that are also in `b`.
   - For the first `m` elements of `a`, it updates `curr` by checking if each element is in `b` and adjusting `cnt_b` accordingly.

4. **Checking Initial Window:**
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` because the initial window is good.

5. **Sliding the Window:**
   - For each subsequent position of the window, the program updates `curr` by:
     - Removing the element that is sliding out of the window (`a[i]`) and updating `cnt_b` and `curr`.
     - Adding the new element that is sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`) and updating `cnt_b` and `curr`.
   - If `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k` after these adjustments, it increments `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counters:**
   - After processing each test case, the program resets the counters in `cnt_b` for the next test case.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads and processes the input for each test case.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The counting mechanism for elements in `b` is correct and stored in `cnt_b`.

3. **Sliding Window Logic:**
   - The logic for maintaining the count of elements in the current window (`curr`) is correct.
   - The sliding window approach ensures that the program checks each possible subsegment of length `m` in `a`.

4. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `if curr >= k:` correctly identifies when a subsegment is good.

5. **Resetting Counters:**
   - Resetting `cnt_b` for each test case ensures that the program starts fresh for each new test case.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine how many subsegments of `a` of length `m` are good according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
