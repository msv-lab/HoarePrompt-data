The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and y. For each test case, it calculates a value z based on x and y, ensuring z meets certain conditions relative to t. It then prints the final value of z for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated values of z for each case.
