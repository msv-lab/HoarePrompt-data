Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `(x, y)` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens Needed**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula represents the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens without considering the remaining space.
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula calculates the total number of 1x1 cells that can be filled by the 2x2 icons already placed.
   - If `m` is less than `a`, it means there are not enough cells to accommodate all 1x1 icons using the existing 2x2 icons. Therefore, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`, which accounts for the remaining 1x1 icons and ensures that each screen is fully utilized.

3. **Output**:
   - The final result `z` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic against the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(1 - 11 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0`
  - Total screens: `1 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m >= a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `1 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
  - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `m > a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `2 + 0 = 2`

- **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
  - `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 18`
  - Since `m > a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `2 + 0 = 2`

- **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(1 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Total screens: `0 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(8 - 11 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0`
  - Total screens: `1 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - No additional screens needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - No additional screens needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - No additional screens needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(8 - 7 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Total screens: `1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
  - `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`
  - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 45`
  - Since `m > a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `5 + 0 = 5`

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed based on the given logic and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
