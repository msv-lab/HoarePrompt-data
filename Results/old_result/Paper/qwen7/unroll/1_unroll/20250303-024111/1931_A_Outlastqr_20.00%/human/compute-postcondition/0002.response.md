Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78 after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `word` will vary based on the input provided within each iteration of the loop, but it will always follow the rules defined in the loop body.
