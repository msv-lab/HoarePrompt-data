You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string contains characters representing different entities (empty cells, players, goals, and the Quaffle). elements is a dictionary mapping entities to their coordinates on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of two lists, each containing the coordinates of the goals for the respective teams. points is a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams. mov is a dictionary mapping movement commands (U, D, L, R) to their corresponding coordinate changes. t is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99; `grid` is a list of `n` rows, each row being a list of length `m`, `elements` is a dictionary containing {'.B': (-1, -1)} and potentially updated positions for other players, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing boolean values indicating whether a player is active, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list containing the total points scored by each team after all iterations, with the first element being the score for team 0 and the second element being the score for team 1.
    #
    #The `t` value will reflect the total number of iterations the loop has run. The `elements` dictionary will contain the final positions of all players and the golden snitch after all iterations. The `allPlayers` dictionary will indicate which players are still active. The `points` list will show the cumulative scores for both teams based on the actions performed within the loop.
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the total score for team 0 and [points[1]] is the total score for team 1 after all iterations)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a 2D list of strings representing the field, a dictionary mapping entities to their coordinates on the grid, a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle, a list of two lists containing the coordinates of the goals for the respective teams, a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, a dictionary mapping movement commands to their corresponding coordinate changes, and a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game. The function does not return anything.
