(n, m) are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. grid is a 2D list of strings representing the field, where each string contains characters representing different entities (empty cells, players, goals, and the Quaffle). elements is a dictionary mapping entities to their coordinates on the grid. allPlayers is a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle. goal is a list of two lists, each containing the coordinates of the goals for the respective teams. points is a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams. mov is a dictionary mapping movement commands (U, D, L, R) to their corresponding coordinate changes. t is a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game.
