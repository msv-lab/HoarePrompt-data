Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99.
- `m` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99.
- `grid` is a list of `n` rows, each row being a list of length `m`.
- `elements` is a dictionary containing `{'B': (-1, -1)}` and potentially updated positions for other players.
- `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing boolean values indicating whether a player is still active.
- `goal` is a list containing two empty lists.
- `points` is a list containing the total points scored by each team after all iterations, with the first element being the score for team 0 and the second element being the score for team 1.

The `print` statement outputs the final scores for both teams. Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their meaning.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the total score for team 0 and [points[1]] is the total score for team 1 after all iterations)**
