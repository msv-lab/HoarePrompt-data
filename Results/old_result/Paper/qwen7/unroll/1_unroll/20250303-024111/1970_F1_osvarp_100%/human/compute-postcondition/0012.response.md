Output State: `t` is an integer representing the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99; `grid` is a list of `n` rows, each row being a list of length `m`, `elements` is a dictionary containing {'.B': (-1, -1)} and potentially updated positions for other players, `allPlayers` is a dictionary containing boolean values indicating whether a player is active, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list containing the total points scored by each team after all iterations, with the first element being the score for team 0 and the second element being the score for team 1.

The `t` value will reflect the total number of iterations the loop has run. The `elements` dictionary will contain the final positions of all players and the golden snitch after all iterations. The `allPlayers` dictionary will indicate which players are still active. The `points` list will show the cumulative scores for both teams based on the actions performed within the loop.
