Output State: **`t` is an integer read from stdin, `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99, `m` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99; `grid` is a list of `n` rows, each row being a list of length `m`, `elements` is a dictionary containing {'.B': (-1, -1)}, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is a list containing [0, 0]**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This changes the value of `t`, but does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, or `points`.
