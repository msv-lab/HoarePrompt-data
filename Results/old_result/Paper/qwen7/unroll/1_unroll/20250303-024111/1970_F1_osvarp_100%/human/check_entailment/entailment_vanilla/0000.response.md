### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes the grid, reads the input, and populates the necessary data structures such as `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points`.
   - The grid is parsed correctly, and the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle are stored in the `elements` dictionary.

2. **Action Processing:**
   - The function processes each action in the game. It correctly handles movement, catching, and throwing actions.
   - For movement (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`), the function updates the position of the player in the `elements` dictionary.
   - For catching (`C`), the function correctly updates the state of the player and prints the appropriate message.
   - For throwing (`T`), the function correctly updates the state of the player and checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal, updating the score accordingly.

3. **Goal Checking:**
   - The function `goalIn` correctly identifies whether a given position is in a goal for either team.
   - The function `isPlayer` correctly identifies whether a given element is a player.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct messages for scoring and elimination.
   - The final score is printed correctly after processing all actions.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for processing the game actions and determining the score. The code handles all the specified actions and outputs the correct results.

### Correctness:
**True**
