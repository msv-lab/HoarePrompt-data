Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99.
   - `i` is the loop counter, which starts from 0.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute at least once if `i < n` is true.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is 0 initially (as it starts the loop).
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99, and `i` is less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99**
