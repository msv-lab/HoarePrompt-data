You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a string representing a position on the field, where the position is either 'RG' or 'BG'. The variable `goal` is a list of two sets, where each set contains the positions of the goals for the red and blue teams respectively.
def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns res which is 0 if pos is in goal[0], 1 if pos is in goal[1], and -1 otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter pos, which is a string representing a position on the field ('RG' or 'BG'). It also accepts a parameter goal, which is a list of two sets containing the positions of the goals for the red and blue teams respectively. The function returns 0 if pos is in goal[0], 1 if pos is in goal[1], and -1 otherwise.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns res which is 0 if pos is in goal[0], 1 if pos is in goal[1], and -1 otherwise.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
