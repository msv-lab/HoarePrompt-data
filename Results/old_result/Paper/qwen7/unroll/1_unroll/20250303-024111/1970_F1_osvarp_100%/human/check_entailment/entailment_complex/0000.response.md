### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function correctly initializes the grid, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` dictionaries based on the input.
   - **Game Loop**: The function iterates over the game steps and updates the positions of the players and the Quaffle. It handles player movements, catching, throwing, and scoring correctly.
   - **Scoring Logic**: The function correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the `points` accordingly. It also handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal by printing the correct team's score.
   - **Final Score**: The function correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

2. **Function `goalIn(pos)`**:
   - **Goal Identification**: The function correctly identifies whether a given position is a goal for the red or blue team by checking if the position is in the appropriate set within the `goal` list.
   - **Return Values**: The function returns 0 for a red goal, 1 for a blue goal, and -1 for any other position, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

3. **Function `isPlayer(el)`**:
   - **Player Check**: The function correctly checks if an entity is a player by verifying that it starts with 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G'.
   - **Return Values**: The function returns `True` for valid players and `False` for invalid entities, which is consistent with the expected behavior.

Given that all functions handle their respective tasks correctly and the overall logic of the program aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
