### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A result list `res` of size `n` is initialized with `None` values.
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the MEX value for the current position in the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `ar` using a for loop.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates the corresponding value in the permutation `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]` if this value is greater than the current `mex`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result list `res` as a space-separated string.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initial MEX Value:**
   - When `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and goes down to 0, the initial `mex` value is `n`. This is correct because initially, no elements are considered, and the MEX is `n`.

2. **MEX Update Logic:**
   - For each `ar[i]`, the MEX value is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted based on the current value of `ar[i]`.

3. **Permutation Validity:**
   - The construction process ensures that each `res[i]` is a unique integer between 0 and `n-1` because `mex` is always updated to ensure the correct MEX value for the remaining elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `ar[i]` might be equal to `mex`, ensuring that `mex` is correctly adjusted.

### Detailed Explanation:

- **Backward Construction:**
  - The backward construction ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted for each position in the permutation.
  - By iterating backward, the program can ensure that the MEX value is the smallest integer not yet used in the permutation.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX value is calculated correctly by subtracting `ar[i]` from `mex`. This ensures that the MEX value reflects the smallest integer not present in the current partial permutation.

- **Unique Integers:**
  - Since the MEX value is updated correctly and the permutation is constructed in reverse order, each integer from 0 to `n-1` will be used exactly once.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation based on the given array `ar` and the MEX values. The logic for updating `mex` and constructing the permutation is sound and follows the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
