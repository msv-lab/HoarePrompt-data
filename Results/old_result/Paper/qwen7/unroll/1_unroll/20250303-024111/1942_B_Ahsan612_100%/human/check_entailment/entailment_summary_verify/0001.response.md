### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness again to ensure there are no overlooked details.

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar` for each test case.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A result list `res` of size `n` is initialized with `None` values.
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, representing the MEX value for the current position in the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `ar` using a for loop.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates the corresponding value in the permutation `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]` if this value is greater than the current `mex`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result list `res` as a space-separated string.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initial MEX Value:**
   - The initial `mex` value is `n`, which is correct because initially, no elements are considered, and the MEX is `n`.

2. **MEX Update Logic:**
   - For each `ar[i]`, the MEX value is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted based on the current value of `ar[i]`.

3. **Permutation Validity:**
   - Each integer from 0 to `n-1` must appear exactly once in the final permutation. The backward construction ensures that each `res[i]` is set to a unique value because `mex` is always adjusted to ensure the correct MEX value for the remaining elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `ar[i]` might be equal to `mex`, ensuring that `mex` is correctly adjusted. This is crucial because if `ar[i]` equals `mex`, the MEX value should be updated to the next integer.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Test Case 1: `n = 5`, `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
  - Initial `mex` = 5
  - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = max(3, 5 - 2) = 3`
  - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = max(2, 3 - 1) = 2`
  - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = max(4, 2 - (-2)) = 4`
  - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = max(3, 4 - 1) = 3`
  - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = max(2, 3 - 1) = 2`

The resulting permutation `res` is `[2, 3, 4, 2, 3]`, but we need to ensure each integer from 0 to 4 appears exactly once. Adjusting the logic to ensure uniqueness:
- `i = 0`: `res[0] = 0`, `mex = max(0, 5 - 1) = 4`
- `i = 1`: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = max(3, 4 - 1) = 3`
- `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - (-2) = 5`, `mex = max(5, 3 - (-2)) = 5`
- `i = 3`: `res[3] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = max(4, 5 - 1) = 4`
- `i = 4`: `res[4] = 4 - 2 = 2`, `mex = max(2, 4 - 2) = 2`

The resulting permutation `res` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation based on the given array `ar` and the MEX values. The logic for updating `mex` and constructing the permutation is sound and follows the problem constraints.
