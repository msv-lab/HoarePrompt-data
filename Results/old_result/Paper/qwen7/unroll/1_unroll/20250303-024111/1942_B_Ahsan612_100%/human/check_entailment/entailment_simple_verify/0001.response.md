### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify each step in detail:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A result list `res` of size `n` is initialized with `None` values.
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the MEX value for the current position in the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `ar` using a for loop.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates the corresponding value in the permutation `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]` if this value is greater than the current `mex`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result list `res` as a space-separated string.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initial MEX Value:**
   - When `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and goes down to 0, the initial `mex` value is `n`. This is correct because initially, no elements are considered, and the MEX is `n`.

2. **MEX Update Logic:**
   - For each `ar[i]`, the MEX value is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted based on the current value of `ar[i]`.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The construction process ensures that each `res[i]` is a unique integer between 0 and `n-1` because `mex` is always updated to ensure the correct MEX value for the remaining elements.
   - Since `mex` starts at `n` and decreases by `ar[i]` when necessary, it ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted for each position in the permutation.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `ar[i]` might be equal to `mex`, ensuring that `mex` is correctly adjusted. This is because `mex` is only updated if `mex > mex - ar[i]`, which means `mex` will never be less than or equal to `mex - ar[i]`.

### Detailed Example Walkthrough:

Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Test case: `n = 5`, `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
- Initial `mex` is `5`.
- Iteration 1 (`i = 4`): `ar[4] = 2`, `mex - ar[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`.
- Iteration 2 (`i = 3`): `ar[3] = 1`, `mex - ar[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`.
- Iteration 3 (`i = 2`): `ar[2] = -2`, `mex - ar[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4`.
- Iteration 4 (`i = 1`): `ar[1] = 1`, `mex - ar[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`.
- Iteration 5 (`i = 0`): `ar[0] = 1`, `mex - ar[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`.

Result: `res = [2, 3, 4, 2, 3]` which is not a valid permutation since `2` appears twice.

Upon re-evaluating the logic, we realize that the program does not ensure that each integer from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in the permutation. The backward construction approach might lead to duplicate values in the result list.

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee a valid permutation due to potential duplicates in the result list. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
