Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the size `n` and the array `ar` for each test case.

2. **Result Initialization**: The result array `res` is initialized with `None` values, which is then replaced with the calculated values.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the MEX value for the current state of the permutation.
   - The loop iterates backward through the array `ar`. For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If the calculated value of `res[i]` is greater than `mex`, it updates `mex` to this value. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.

4. **Output Formatting**: The results are printed in the correct format, with each element of `res` converted to a string and joined by spaces.

5. **Guaranteed Validity**: Given the constraints and the problem statement, the algorithm guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, and the logic ensures that the calculated permutation satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
