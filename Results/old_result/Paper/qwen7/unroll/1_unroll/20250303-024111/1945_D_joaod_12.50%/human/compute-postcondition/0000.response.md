Output State: **`cases` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `cases` ≤ 10^4. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are yet to be determined.**

This means that the variable `cases` has been assigned the value of an integer input, which is within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain undefined as they will be input later in the code.
