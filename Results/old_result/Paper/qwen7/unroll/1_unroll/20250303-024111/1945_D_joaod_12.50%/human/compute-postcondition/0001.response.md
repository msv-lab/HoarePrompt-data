Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c` which is being initialized by `range(cases)`. This means `c` will take on values from 0 to `cases-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: Since the loop starts with `c` being 0 (as `range(cases)` generates values from 0 to `cases-1`), `c` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

3. **Adjust the State of `cases`**: The value of `cases` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{cases} \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `cases` must be at least 1.

4. **Other Variables**: The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` are not mentioned in the loop head, so their initial states do not need to be adjusted based on the loop condition alone.

Based on this analysis, the only variables that need to be adjusted are `cases` and `c`.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `c` is 0**
