### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and First Query**:
   - The program starts by calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It updates `max_index` based on the result of these queries. This step aims to find the index `i` such that `(p_0 | p_i)` is minimized. However, this does not guarantee that `max_index` will be the index that maximizes the XOR with some other index.

2. **Finding Minimum Indices**:
   - The program then calls `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It updates `min_indices` based on the results of these queries. This step aims to find the indices that give the same result as `(p_{max_index} | p_{min_indices[0]})`. Again, this does not guarantee that the optimal pair will be found.

3. **Final Pair Selection**:
   - The program selects the smallest index in `min_indices` as `min_index` and uses it to find the final pair `(max_index, min_index)`.
   - The assumption here is that this pair will maximize the XOR value, but this is not necessarily true. The program does not explore all possible pairs and relies on the initial assumptions made during the first and second steps.

Given the above analysis, the program does not guarantee that it will find the optimal pair of indices `(i, j)` such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized within the allowed 3n queries. The logic in `func_3` does not ensure that the pair of indices found will always maximize the XOR value.

Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
