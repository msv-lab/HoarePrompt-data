Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop is defined as `range(int(input()))`, the value of `i` will be determined by the input from the user. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by `range()`.

3. **Understand the range function**: The `range(int(input()))` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the number provided by `int(input())`. Therefore, `i` will take values from 0 to `int(input()) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the initial state**: Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the input to `int(input())` will be between 1 and \(10^4\). This means `i` will take values from 0 to \(10^4 - 1\).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `i` should be within the range generated by `range(1)`, which means `i` should be 0.

**State:**
- `i` is 0

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is 0**
