You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the values of `d1` and `d2` dictionaries computed for each test case, followed by the results of `m` queries for each test case. For each query, the output is the difference between the values of `d1` or `d2` at indices `y` and `x`, depending on whether `y` is greater than `x`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), a strictly increasing list of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a \), and an integer \( m \). It then computes two dictionaries, \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list \( a \). Finally, for each of the \( m \) queries, it outputs the difference between the values of \( d1 \) or \( d2 \) at specified indices \( x \) and \( y \), depending on which index is larger.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost depends on the closest city rule and direct travel cost.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code defines a function `func()` which processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of cities `n`, their coordinates `l`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - Two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are used to store the cumulative costs to reach each city from the start and end respectively.
   - The logic in `d1` and `d2` seems to be calculating the cost to reach each city using the closest city rule but there are several issues with the logic:
     - The closest city rule is not correctly implemented.
     - The logic for `d1` and `d2` does not match the problem statement.
     - The cost calculation for reaching a city does not account for the unique closest city condition.
     - The final output calculation does not correctly reflect the minimum cost to travel between two cities.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to find the closest city for each city and then calculate the minimum cost based on the closest city rule.
   - We should maintain an array or dictionary to keep track of the closest city for each city.
   - The cost to travel directly to another city should be the absolute difference in their coordinates.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city should be 1 coin.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are not used correctly and do not reflect the closest city rule.
   - The final output calculation does not account for the correct minimum cost.
