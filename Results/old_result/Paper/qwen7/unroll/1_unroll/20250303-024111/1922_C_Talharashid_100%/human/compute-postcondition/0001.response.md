Output State: The output state consists of the results printed for each query within the loop. For each query (x, y), where y > x, the output is `d1[y] - d1[x]`, and for each query (x, y) where y < x, the output is `d2[y] - d2[x]`. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are computed based on the input list `l` for each test case, and these results are printed for each of the `m` queries.
