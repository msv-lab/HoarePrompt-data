You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair `(n, m)` as described in the loop. Each result is the final value of `ans` after executing the loop for that specific input pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)), calculates a value based on these inputs using a specific algorithm, and prints the result. The final output consists of \( t \) lines, each line representing the calculated result for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 2.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`. This is likely intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs from `count = 2` to `count <= m`.
   - Inside the loop:
     - `countmins` is set to `int(count - 1)`.
     - `g` is calculated as `int(n / count)`.
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `g` is adjusted by subtracting `countmins`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `int(g / count) + 1` to it.
     - `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the final value of `ans` is printed.

### Verification with Example Inputs

Let's verify the logic with the provided example inputs:

#### Test Case 1: \( n = 1 \), \( m = 1 \)
- `ans` starts at 1.
- The loop runs once with `count = 2`, but since `2 > 1`, the loop breaks.
- Output: 1 (Correct)

#### Test Case 2: \( n = 2 \), \( m = 3 \)
- `ans` starts at 2.
- Loop runs twice:
  - First iteration (`count = 2`): `g = 1`, `ans = 2 + 1 = 3`.
  - Second iteration (`count = 3`): `g = 0`, loop breaks.
- Output: 3 (Correct)

#### Test Case 3: \( n = 3 \), \( m = 5 \)
- `ans` starts at 3.
- Loop runs three times:
  - First iteration (`count = 2`): `g = 1`, `ans = 3 + 1 = 4`.
  - Second iteration (`count = 3`): `g = 0`, loop breaks.
- Output: 4 (Correct)

#### Test Case 4: \( n = 10 \), \( m = 8 \)
- `ans` starts at 10.
- Loop runs eight times:
  - First iteration (`count = 2`): `g = 5`, `ans = 10 + 3 = 13`.
  - Second iteration (`count = 3`): `g = 3`, `ans = 13 + 1 = 14`.
  - Third iteration (`count = 4`): `g = 2`, `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`.
  - Fourth iteration (`count = 5`): `g = 2`, `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`.
  - Fifth iteration (`count = 6`): `g = 1`, `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`.
  - Sixth iteration (`count = 7`): `g = 1`, `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`.
  - Seventh iteration (`count = 8`): `g = 1`, `ans = 14 + 0 = 14`.
  - Eighth iteration (`count = 9`): `g = 0`, loop breaks.
- Output: 14 (Correct)

### Conclusion

After verifying the program with the provided examples, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the given constraints.
