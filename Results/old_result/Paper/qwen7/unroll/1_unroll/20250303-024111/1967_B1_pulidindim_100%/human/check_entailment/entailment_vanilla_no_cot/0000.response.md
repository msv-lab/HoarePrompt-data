Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Conditions Check**: The program attempts to check the conditions for valid pairs \((a, b)\), but it does not fully adhere to the problem statement. Specifically, the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It increments the count and adjusts `g`, but this does not correctly account for the gcd condition and the requirement that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Count Initialization**: The initial value of `count` is set to 2, which might not cover all necessary cases. The program also incorrectly assumes that `ans` starts at `n` and then increments based on some assumptions about `g` and `count`.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the given conditions. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they meet the specified conditions. This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.
