Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). The function returns a result based on the conditions given for n and m, and it handles up to 10^4 test cases ensuring the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and m, and returns results based on specific conditions related to n and m while adhering to the constraints provided.
