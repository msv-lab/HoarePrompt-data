Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent. The key is to calculate the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The solution uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of valid configurations for a board of size up to \( n \). Specifically, the `dp` array stores the number of ways to place rooks on a board of size \( i \).

3. **DP Transition**: The transition formula used in the `func_1` function is:
   \[
   dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
   \]
   This formula correctly accounts for the number of ways to add a rook to a board of size \( i \) without attacking any existing rooks.

4. **Input Handling**: The main loop reads the number of test cases, \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \). It also reads the coordinates of the moves made so far, which are stored in a set to track invalid positions.

5. **Final Configuration Calculation**: For each test case, the code calculates the number of valid configurations using the precomputed `dp` values and subtracts the number of invalid positions due to the moves already made.

6. **Edge Cases**: The solution handles edge cases correctly, such as when \( k = 0 \) (no moves made yet), and ensures that the result is taken modulo \( 1000000007 \).

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
