t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5. Each move is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, denoting the row and column of the rook placed in that move.
