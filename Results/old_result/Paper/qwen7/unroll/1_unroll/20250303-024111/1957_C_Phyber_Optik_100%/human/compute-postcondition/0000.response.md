Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, and `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**

Explanation: The code initializes `dp[1]` to 1. This changes the value of `dp[1]`, but the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the conditions for `r_i` and `c_i` remain unchanged.
