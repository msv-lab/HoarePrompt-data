Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.**

Explanation: The code `dp[2] = 3` assigns the value 3 to the second element of the list `dp`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
