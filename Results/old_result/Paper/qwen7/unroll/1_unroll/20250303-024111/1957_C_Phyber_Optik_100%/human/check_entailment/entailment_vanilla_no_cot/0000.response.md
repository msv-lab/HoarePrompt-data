Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Use of `dp` Array**: The `dp` array is used to store results for a different problem. Specifically, `dp[i]` is supposed to represent the number of ways to place rooks on an `i x i` board without any two rooks attacking each other. However, the logic to compute `dp[i]` is incorrect. The formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` does not accurately model the problem constraints.

2. **Invalid Calculation of Final Configurations**: The final configurations are calculated using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, which is not correct. The number of valid configurations should be computed differently, considering the positions already taken by rooks and their mirrored counterparts.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Track Used Positions**: Maintain a set of positions that are already occupied by rooks.
2. **Calculate Remaining Valid Positions**: For an `n x n` board, calculate the number of valid positions left after accounting for the positions already occupied.
3. **Compute Configurations**: Use combinatorial methods to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys
from math import comb

sys.setrecursionlimit(400000)
MOD = 1000000007

def count_configurations(n, invalid_positions):
    # Calculate the number of valid rows and columns
    valid_rows = n - len({pos[0] for pos in invalid_positions})
    valid_cols = n - len({pos[1] for pos in invalid_positions})
    
    # Calculate the number of valid positions
    valid_positions = valid_rows * valid_cols
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions
    # This is equivalent to choosing pairs of valid rows and columns
    return comb(valid_positions, n // 2) % MOD

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    invalid_positions = []
    for _ in range(k):
        r, c = map(int, input().split())
        invalid_positions.append((r, c))
    
    print(count_configurations(n, invalid_positions))
```

This approach correctly calculates the number of valid configurations by leveraging combinatorial methods and ensuring no two rooks attack each other.
