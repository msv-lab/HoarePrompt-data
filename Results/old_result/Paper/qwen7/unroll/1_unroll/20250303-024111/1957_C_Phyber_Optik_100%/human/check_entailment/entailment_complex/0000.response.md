Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where the rooks cannot attack each other. The rook placements are mirrored between the player and the computer.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The provided solution uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations. The function `func_1` precomputes the number of configurations for positions up to \( n \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `dp[1] = 1`: One way to place a rook on a 1x1 board.
   - `dp[2] = 3`: Three ways to place rooks on a 2x2 board without them attacking each other.
   - For \( i \geq 3 \), `dp[i]` is computed using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic calculates the number of free positions (`n - len(invalid)`), where `invalid` is the set of positions already occupied by rooks.
   - The result is `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` to handle cases where no more valid positions are left.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the coordinates of the rooks placed so far.
   - It updates the `invalid` set with the positions of the rooks.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The dynamic programming approach correctly calculates the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The logic for handling the `invalid` set and the modulo operation ensures the result is within the required bounds.
   - The overall structure and logic align with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
