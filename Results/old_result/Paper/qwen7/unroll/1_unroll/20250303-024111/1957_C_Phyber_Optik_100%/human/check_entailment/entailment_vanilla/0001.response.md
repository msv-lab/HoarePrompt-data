Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You place white rooks, and the computer mirrors your moves by placing black rooks in the opposite diagonal position.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to precompute values for the function `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of invalid positions (positions already occupied by rooks).
   - It then uses the precomputed DP table to find the number of valid configurations.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for different board sizes.
   - The base cases are set: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For larger board sizes, the recurrence relation is used: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.

4. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the program reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( k \) moves and adds the row and column indices to a set of invalid positions.
   - The number of valid positions left is calculated as \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).
   - The result is printed using the precomputed DP value `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - For \( n = 1 \), there is only one configuration (no rooks).
   - For \( n = 2 \), there are 3 configurations: (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0).

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct for calculating the number of configurations.
   - This relation accounts for adding a rook in a new row/column while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

3. **Invalid Positions Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the invalid positions by subtracting their count from \( n \).
   - Using the precomputed DP table ensures efficient calculation of the number of configurations.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `1000000007` is applied correctly to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations and efficiently handles the constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
