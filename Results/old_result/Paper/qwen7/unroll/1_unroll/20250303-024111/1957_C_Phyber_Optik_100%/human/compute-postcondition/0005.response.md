The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. The function does not directly depend on other parameters like `t`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i` from the given constraints, but rather focuses on the value of `n`. There is no specified return value or behavior described in the output. Therefore, based on the given information, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 3⋅10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5.**
