Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the minimum of each pair of consecutive elements from the sorted list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of `2n` integers, which ensures that when we take pairs of consecutive elements, we are always picking the smaller of the two.
3. **Scoring Calculation**: By summing up the first element of each pair (i.e., `l[i]` where `i` ranges from `0` to `2*n-2` in steps of `2`), the program effectively adds the minimum of each pair to the score.
4. **Output**: The score is printed for each test case, which is the required output format.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program correctly computes the maximum score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
