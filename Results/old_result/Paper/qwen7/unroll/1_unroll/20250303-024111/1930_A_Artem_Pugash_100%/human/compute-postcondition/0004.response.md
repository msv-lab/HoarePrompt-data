Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n`, and a list of `2n` integers. It then sorts these integers and calculates the score as the sum of the smallest element in each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.**
