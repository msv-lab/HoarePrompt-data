Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score according to the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The integers are sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that when pairs are chosen, the smaller number of each pair is always selected, which maximizes the score.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices. This corresponds to selecting the minimum of each pair `(l[i], l[i+1])` and adding it to the score. Since the list is sorted, `l[i]` is always less than or equal to `l[i+1]`, so `l[i]` is effectively the minimum of the pair.

4. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
