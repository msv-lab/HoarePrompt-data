Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of numbers. Sorting ensures that when we take pairs of numbers, the minimum of each pair is always the smaller number in the sorted list. This is crucial for achieving the maximum possible score because we want to maximize the sum of the minimum values from each pair.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first element of each pair (which is the smaller element due to sorting) to the score. This ensures that the score is maximized because we are always adding the smallest available number at each step.

4. **Output**: The program prints the score for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
