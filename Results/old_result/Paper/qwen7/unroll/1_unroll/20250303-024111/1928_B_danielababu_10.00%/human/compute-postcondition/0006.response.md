Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of positive integers. It returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative product of `arr` elements from right to left, starting with `tem` as 1.**

This means the function takes a list of positive integers and generates a new list where each element is the product of all the elements to the right of the corresponding element in the original list, starting with 1 as the initial value for the product.
