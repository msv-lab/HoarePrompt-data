Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions do not implement the required functionality. The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. However, none of the provided functions address this requirement. Instead, they seem to be related to operations like reading input, sorting, and calculating prefix and suffix products, which are not relevant to solving the given problem.

To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Read the input array.
2. Use a permutation to transform the array such that the maximum frequency of any element is maximized.
3. Output the maximum frequency of any element in the transformed array.

Since none of the provided functions perform these steps, the program is incorrect.
