Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used to iterate over the range defined by `len(arr) - 1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`.
   - `len(arr)`: This is the length of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being equal to `len(arr) - 1`. After the first iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the loop will stop when `i` becomes -1.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop head variables**:
   - `i` should start at `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `len(arr)` should be such that `i` remains non-negative until the loop stops.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start and execute properly. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` starts at a valid value and that `len(arr)` is sufficient to allow the loop to run.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
- `arr` is a list of positive integers.
- `ans` is an empty list (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `tem` is 1 (this does not affect the loop execution).
- `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `len(arr)` must be at least 1 to ensure that `i` is non-negative initially and the loop can run.

State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `len(arr)` must be at least 1**
