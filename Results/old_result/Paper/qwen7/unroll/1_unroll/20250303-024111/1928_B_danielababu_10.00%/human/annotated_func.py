#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes user input consisting of multiple integers across several test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the length of the array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`.

    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string represents an integer from the input split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input from the user, splitting it into a list of strings based on spaces, converting each string to a sorted list. Each string in the input represents an integer, and the final output is a sorted list of these strings.
