Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that takes input splits it into multiple integers and returns them as a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads multiple integers from input, splits them, and returns them as a tuple. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or any other variables. Therefore, the precondition remains the same, and only the definition of `R` is updated.
