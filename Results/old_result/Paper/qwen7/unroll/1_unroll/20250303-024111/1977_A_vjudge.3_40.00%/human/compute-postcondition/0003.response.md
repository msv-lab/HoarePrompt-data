Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' responses based on the conditions evaluated in the loop for each pair of integers (n, m) entered. Specifically, 'Yes' is printed if n equals m, if m is greater than n, if m is one less than n, or if both n and m are even or both are odd. Otherwise, 'No' is printed. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input pairs provided during the loop's execution.
