### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
- Moves can either add or remove one cube at a time.
- The key is to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` aligns with the possible outcomes of adding and removing cubes.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks several conditions:
  - If `n == m`, it prints "Yes".
  - If `m > n`, it prints "No".
  - If `m == n - 1`, it prints "Yes".
  - If both `n` and `m` are either even or odd, it prints "Yes".
  - Otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Case `n == m`:**
   - If `n` equals `m`, it means no net change in the number of cubes, so the result is "Yes". This is correct.

2. **Case `m > n`:**
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the total number of moves, so the result is "No". This is correct.

3. **Case `m == n - 1`:**
   - If `m` is one less than `n`, it means one cube was removed, so the result is "Yes". This is correct.

4. **Case `n` and `m` are either both even or both odd:**
   - This condition is overly restrictive. Consider the case `n = 4` and `m = 3`. Here, `n` is even and `m` is odd. The program should allow this scenario since we can achieve `m = 3` by performing a sequence like add, add, remove, add. The current logic incorrectly prints "No" in this case.

5. **Other Cases:**
   - The remaining cases are handled correctly according to the problem constraints.

#### Correctness of the Original Assessment:
The original assessment correctly identified that the program fails to handle the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa, due to the overly restrictive condition `n % 2 == 0 and m % 2 == 0` or `n % 2 != 0 and m % 2 != 0`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where the parity of `n` and `m` is different but still allows achieving the desired number of cubes through a valid sequence of moves.
