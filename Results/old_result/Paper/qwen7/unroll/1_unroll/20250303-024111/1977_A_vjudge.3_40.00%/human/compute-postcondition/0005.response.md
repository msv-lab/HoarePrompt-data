Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each pair, it checks specific conditions and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on those conditions. If \( n \) equals \( m \), if \( m \) is greater than \( n \), if \( m \) is one less than \( n \), or if both \( n \) and \( m \) are either even or odd, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, no value is returned.**
