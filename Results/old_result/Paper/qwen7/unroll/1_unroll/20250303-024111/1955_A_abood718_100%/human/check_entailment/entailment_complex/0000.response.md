Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts with the given prices `a` and `b`. However, the logic in the code does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly when comparing the costs of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks whether buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually. This is not always true. For instance, if `a = 10` and `b = 20`, buying two yogurts individually would cost `20` burles, while the promotion price is also `20` burles. In this case, the promotion is not cheaper.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the code correctly calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`. This part is correct because it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If `A` is odd, the code splits the yogurts into pairs and handles the remaining one separately. However, this approach might not always yield the minimum cost. For example, if `A = 3`, `C = 18`, and `B = 10`, the code calculates the cost as `18 + 10 = 28` burles. But the optimal solution would be to buy two yogurts at the promotion price (`18`) and one at the regular price (`10`), which totals `28` burles. However, another scenario like `A = 3`, `C = 17`, and `B = 10` would incorrectly suggest buying two at the promotion price (`17`) and one at the regular price (`10`), resulting in `27` burles, which is cheaper than buying all three at the regular price (`30`).

To fix this, we need to ensure that we always consider the best option between buying in pairs and buying individually. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if b * 2 < a + a:
            # Promotion is cheaper
            print(n * b)
        else:
            # Individual purchase is cheaper
            print(n * a)
```

With this correction, the program will correctly calculate the minimum cost for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
