You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, for each test case, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). The number of integers printed will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer \(t\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \(t\), \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\). For each test case, it reads these integers and calculates one of three possible values based on specific conditions: if \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\); if \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\); otherwise, it prints \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of integers corresponding to the calculated values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them at the regular price.
       - In this case, the program prints `A * B`, which is incorrect because it should be printing `A * C / 2`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotion price is not cheaper.
       - The program then checks if `A` is even.
         - If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is correct.
         - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as follows:
           - It buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible using the promotion (`X = A // 2`).
           - It then adds the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price (`B`).

3. **Cost Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost when `A` is odd is correct. It buys as many pairs as possible using the promotion and then adds the cost of the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the scenario where `A` is even and prints the minimum cost.
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost when `B * 2 < C`. Instead of printing `A * B`, it should print `A * C / 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it prints `A * B` instead of `A * C / 2` when `B * 2 < C`.
