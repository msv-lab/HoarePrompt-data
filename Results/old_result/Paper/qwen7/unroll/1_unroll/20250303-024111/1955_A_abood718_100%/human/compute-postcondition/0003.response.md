Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs t, n, a, and b where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) for n and 1 and 30 (inclusive) for a and b. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

However, based on the provided information, it seems the function might be processing multiple test cases defined by the variable t, where for each test case, it takes n, a, and b as inputs and performs some operation (though not specified here). Since no explicit return value is mentioned, it implies the function might be performing operations within the function body without returning a value.
