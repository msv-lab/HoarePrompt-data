Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n)`. Therefore, the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values for `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer that defines the range of the loop.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - The initial value of `i` is `0`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `n` must be greater than 0 to ensure the loop can execute.
   - `i` must be set to `0` as it is the starting point of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
