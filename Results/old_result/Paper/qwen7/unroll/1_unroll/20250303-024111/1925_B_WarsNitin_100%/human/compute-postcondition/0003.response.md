Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes three variables t, x, and n where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. It returns a value based on the conditions given for x and n.**

This means the function, although not explicitly defined with parameters, works with three implied variables (t, x, and n) within specified ranges and returns a value determined by the relationship between x and n.
