Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions for Printing 'yes' or 'no':**
   - The conditions for printing 'yes' or 'no' are not correctly implemented.
   - Specifically, the condition `if (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):` is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. It seems to be an attempt to check if one side is twice the other but is incorrectly structured.
   
2. **Unnecessary Complexities:**
   - The logic for determining whether a rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles and reformed into another rectangle is overly complex and not correctly implemented.

3. **Simpler Approach:**
   - A simpler approach would be to check if either `a` or `b` is even, as this allows for the rectangle to be split into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into another rectangle. If both `a` and `b` are odd, no such transformation is possible.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This simplified version correctly checks if either dimension of the rectangle is even, which is sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle.
