Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks specific conditions involving \(a\) and \(b\), and prints either 'yes' or 'no' based on these conditions. Specifically, if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) equals \(-a\) or \(-b\), it prints 'no'. If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
