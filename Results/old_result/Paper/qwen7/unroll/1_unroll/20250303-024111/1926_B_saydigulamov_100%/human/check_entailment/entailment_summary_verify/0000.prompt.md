You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

                k.append(b.count('1'))

            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of '0's and '1's. For each test case, it checks if the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the shape being greater than 1. Based on the configuration of '1's, it prints either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and then reads each row, counting the number of '1's in each row.
3. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

This logic is flawed because:
- A triangle can have different counts of '1's in its rows. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows with 5, 3, and 1 '1's respectively.
- Similarly, a square can have different counts of '1's in its rows. For example, a square with `k=3` would have 3 '1's in each row.

Here is an example where the program fails:
Consider the following grid:
```
5
00000
00000
01110
11111
00000
```
This grid contains a triangle with `k=5`. However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because the counts of '1's in the first two rows (both having 0 '1's) are equal.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check the structure of the grid to see if it matches the pattern of a triangle or a square. This involves checking the positions of '1's in each row and column to ensure they match the required patterns for a triangle or a square.
