Output State: **The output will be either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' printed for each test case based on the condition given in the loop. Each test case's result is determined by the count of '1's in the input strings. If the counts of '1's in the first two strings are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise 'TRIANGLE'. The exact sequence of 'SQUARE' and 'TRIANGLE' depends on the input provided during the execution of the loop.**
