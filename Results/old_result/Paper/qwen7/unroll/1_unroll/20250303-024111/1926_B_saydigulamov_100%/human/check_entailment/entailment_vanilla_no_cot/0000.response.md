Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Shape Detection Logic**: 
   - The program checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is the same (`if k[0] == k[1]:`). This logic is insufficient because it only considers the first two rows and does not account for the structure of a triangle or a square.
   - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the counts of '1's in rows should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...` for increasing rows.

2. **Triangle Identification**:
   - The program does not check if the '1's form a triangular pattern. Instead, it only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's.

3. **Square Identification**:
   - Similarly, the program does not check if the '1's form a square pattern by ensuring that each row has the same number of '1's.

To fix this, the program needs to properly identify the structure of the shape by checking the patterns of '1's in the grid. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for Triangle
        is_triangle = True
        for j in range(n):
            if '1' not in grid[j]:
                continue
            ones_count = grid[j].count('1')
            expected_ones_count = 2 * (j + 1) - 1
            if ones_count != expected_ones_count:
                is_triangle = False
                break
        
        # Check for Square
        is_square = True
        for j in range(n):
            if '1' not in grid[j]:
                continue
            ones_count = grid[j].count('1')
            if ones_count != n // (j + 1):
                is_square = False
                break
        
        if is_triangle:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        elif is_square:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('NO SHAPE')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the '1's form a triangular or square pattern by comparing the counts of '1's in each row against the expected counts for a triangle or a square.
