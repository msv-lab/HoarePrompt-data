Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of values \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \) of length \( m \) consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) distinct combinations of \( k \) characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it identifies a missing character and constructs a new string with \( n \) characters, including the missing one, and prints "NO" followed by this new string.**
