You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \), followed by \( t \) sets of values \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \) of length \( m \) consisting of the first \( k \) lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) distinct combinations of \( k \) characters. If it does, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it identifies a missing character and constructs a new string with \( n \) characters, including the missing one, and prints "NO" followed by this new string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of unique subsequences of length `k` found in `s`.
   - `cur` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current state of the bitmask representing the characters seen so far.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty string to store the last character of the current sequence being processed.

3. **Processing the String `s`**:
   - The program iterates through each character `ss` in the string `s`.
   - It calculates the index `cur_ss` of the character `ss` in the alphabet.
   - It updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character if it hasn't been seen before.
   - If all `k` characters have been seen (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments the count `cnt` and resets `cur` and appends the character `ss` to `ans`.

4. **Checking for Valid Subsequences**:
   - After processing the entire string `s`, the program checks if `cnt` is at least `n`.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that represents a missing subsequence of length `n`.

5. **Constructing Missing Subsequence**:
   - The program finds the first character that is missing in the bitmask `cur` and appends it to `ans`.
   - It then appends `n - cnt - 1` 'a' characters to `ans` to complete the string of length `n`.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Bitmask Calculation**:
   - The bitmask calculation is incorrect. The program should ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked, not just the first `k` characters.
   - The bitmask should be used to track all possible subsequences of length `n`, not just the first `k` characters.

2. **Subsequence Check**:
   - The program does not correctly check if all possible subsequences of length `n` exist in `s`. Instead, it only checks for the presence of the last character of each subsequence.

3. **Missing Subsequence Construction**:
   - The construction of the missing subsequence is not correct. The program only considers the first missing character and does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid subsequence of length `n`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
