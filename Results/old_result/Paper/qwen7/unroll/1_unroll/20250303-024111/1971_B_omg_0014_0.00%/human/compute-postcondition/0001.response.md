Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the loop to start, `i` should be set to 0 initially.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer.

3. **Consider the Given State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is not directly used in the loop head, its value does not need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - We also need to set `i` to 0 to start the loop.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
