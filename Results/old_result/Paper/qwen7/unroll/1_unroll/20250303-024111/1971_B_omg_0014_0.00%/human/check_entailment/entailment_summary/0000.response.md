Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases as specified.
- It reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it checks if the number of unique characters in the string `s` is exactly 2 using `len(set(s)) == 2`.
- If the number of unique characters is 2, it prints 'NO', which is correct because rearranging such a string would result in the same string.
- If the number of unique characters is not 2, it prints 'YES' and then prints either the lexicographically sorted version or the reverse sorted version of `s`.
- The logic to print the lexicographically sorted version (`b`) or the reverse sorted version (`c`) is correct, ensuring that a different arrangement is provided if possible.
- The program does not handle the case where the string has only one unique character, but this is not required by the problem statement since such a string would also be considered invalid for rearrangement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
