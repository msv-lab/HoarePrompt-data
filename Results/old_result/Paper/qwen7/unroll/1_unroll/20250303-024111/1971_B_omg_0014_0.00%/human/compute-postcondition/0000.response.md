Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The length and content of the string `s` are not affected by this code snippet.
