Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (all between 1 and \(10^{18}\)). For each test case, it calculates a value \(mn\) as the minimum of \(a\) and \(b\) plus \(m\). Depending on whether \(m\) is divisible by both \(a\) and \(b\) and neither \(a\) nor \(b\) is 1, it prints either \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b} + 1\) or \(\frac{mn}{a} + \frac{mn}{b}\). The function outputs these results for all test cases.**
