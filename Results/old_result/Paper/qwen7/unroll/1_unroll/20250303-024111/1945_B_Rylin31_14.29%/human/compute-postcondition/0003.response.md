Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either `(mn // a + mn // b + 1)` or `(mn // a + mn // b)`, depending on the conditions specified in the loop body. Here, `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`, where `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers provided by user input for each iteration of the loop.
