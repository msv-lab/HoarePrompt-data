Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Launch Interval:**
   - The variable `mn` is calculated as `min(a, b) + m`. This is intended to represent the minimum interval between two consecutive launches from different installations plus the visibility duration of a single firework.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` (`m % a == 0 and m % b == 0`) and ensures that neither `a` nor `b` is 1.
     - If this condition is true, the program calculates the number of fireworks visible using the formula `mn // a + mn // b + 1`.
     - If the condition is false, it uses the simpler formula `mn // a + mn // b`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks:**
   - The formula used in the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
   - The correct approach should involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then determining how many fireworks can be launched within the visibility period `m + 1`.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly:**
   - The condition check for divisibility and non-units (1) is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correct calculation.
   - The logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is flawed.

### Correct Approach:

To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to:
1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine how many multiples of the LCM fit into the visibility period `m + 1`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
        max_visible = (m + 1) // lcm_ab
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
