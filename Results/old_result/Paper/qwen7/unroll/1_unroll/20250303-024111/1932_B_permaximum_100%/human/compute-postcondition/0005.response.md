Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, the function starts with `current_year = 0` and iterates over the list of integers `a`, updating `current_year` by adding each integer `a_i` to it. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after processing each test case.**
