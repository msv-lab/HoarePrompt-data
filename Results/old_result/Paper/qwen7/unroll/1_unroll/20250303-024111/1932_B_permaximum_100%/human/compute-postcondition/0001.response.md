Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `test` is derived from the `test_cases` list.
   - Therefore, the relevant variables are `test_cases` and `test`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_cases`.
   - Once `test_cases` is exhausted, the loop will terminate.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
   - `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions, where each test case description is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop will iterate over `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `test` will take the value of each tuple in `test_cases` during each iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `test_cases` must contain at least one element (a tuple).
- `test` will be the first tuple in `test_cases` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must contain at least one element, `test` is the first tuple in `test_cases`**.
