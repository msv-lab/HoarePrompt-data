Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. For instance, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  2 4 8
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  8
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  16
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the next year when the signs will occur. According to the problem description, the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. However, the program's logic for calculating the next year does not account for this sequential nature correctly. For example, when the first sign occurs in year 2, the program should wait until year 4 for the second sign, but instead, it waits until year 8, leading to incorrect results.
