Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially based on their periodicities. The program correctly processes each test case by initializing `current_year` to 0 and updating it using the least common multiple (LCM) of `current_year` and each integer `a_i` in the list `a`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the program's logic:
1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
3. It initializes `current_year` to 0.
4. For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur by finding the LCM of `current_year` and `ai`.
5. It updates `current_year` to this next year.
6. After processing all periodicities in the test case, it appends the final value of `current_year` to the results list.
7. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially by calculating the LCM iteratively. This approach ensures that the tribe waits for the first sign, then waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one, and so on.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
