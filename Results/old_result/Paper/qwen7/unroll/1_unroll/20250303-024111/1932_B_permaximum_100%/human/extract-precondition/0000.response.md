Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.**
