Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a`).
3. **Calculation Logic**: The function `func_1` calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially. It initializes `current_year` to 0 and iterates through each periodicity, adjusting the `current_year` to the next multiple of the periodicity that hasn't been passed yet.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case correctly.

Given the logic and the example provided, the program should work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
