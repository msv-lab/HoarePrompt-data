Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. Here's a detailed breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a_i`) for each test case.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, the program initializes `current_year` to 0, which is the starting point for finding the next sign.

3. **Finding the Next Sign Year**: The program iterates through each periodicity `ai` and calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the current year and the periodicity `ai`. If the current year is divisible by `ai`, the next year is simply `current_year + ai`. Otherwise, it finds the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

4. **Updating Current Year**: After determining the next year for each sign, the program updates `current_year` to this new value and continues to the next sign.

5. **Output**: The program collects the final `current_year` for each test case and returns these values as a list.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the program will produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
