Output State: `results` is a list containing integers. For each test case, the corresponding integer in `results` is the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for the given sequence of integers `a`. The value of `current_year` is determined based on the rules specified within the loop: it is updated to the next year that is a multiple of `ai` when the current year is not divisible by `ai`, or it simply incremented by `ai` when the current year is divisible by `ai`.
