Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position Adjustment**: It adjusts the index `k` to be zero-based, which is correct.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Identifying Indices**: The function `func_1` aims to find indices where the elements are greater than the `k`-th element. However, the logic to identify these indices is flawed.
   - **Return Values**:
     - If no such indices are found (`ind == []`), it returns `n - 1`. This is incorrect because it should consider the possibility of swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow to maximize the number of wins.
     - If only one such index is found, it returns values based on the position of this index relative to `k`. Again, this logic is incomplete and may not cover all scenarios.
     - If two such indices are found, it returns values based on the positions of these indices relative to `k`. This part seems to handle some cases but is still incomplete and potentially incorrect.

Given the provided execution summary, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the optimal strategy of swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow to maximize the number of wins. The logic provided in the execution summary suggests a more complex approach that is not fully implemented in the code.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
