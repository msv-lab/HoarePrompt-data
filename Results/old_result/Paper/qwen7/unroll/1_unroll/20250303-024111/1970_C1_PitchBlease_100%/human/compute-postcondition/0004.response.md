Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with each edge from the `edges` list added bidirectionally; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node (i.e., leaf nodes); the `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, and the `start` variable remains an integer representing the starting node for the round.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `leaves` containing all the nodes in the tree that have exactly one adjacent node, which are the leaf nodes. The values of `tree`, `n`, and `start` remain unchanged.
