### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given Python program step-by-step using the annotated code and the provided test cases to ensure the correctness of the solution.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses two lists `A` and `B` to store intermediate results.
   - `A` stores the cumulative time for cells where the direction changes from `>` to `<`.
   - `B` stores the cumulative time for cells where the direction changes from `<` to `>`.

3. **Computing `A` and `B`:**
   - For `A`, it iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For `B`, it iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - These computations are correct as they account for the movement and inversion rules.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic computes the time for each pinball starting from each cell.
   - It uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time.
   - The logic handles different cases based on the current cell's direction (`>` or `<`).
   - The calculations are complex but seem to follow the problem's rules accurately.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundary cells.
   - It also handles cases where the pinball might move back and forth before leaving the grid.

### Verification with Example

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Grid: `><<`
- Length: 3

- For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell):
  - Direction: `>`
  - Time: \(3\) (as shown in the diagram).

- For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(6\) (as shown in the diagram).

- For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(5\) (as shown in the diagram).

#### Test Case 2:
- Grid: `<<<<`
- Length: 4

- For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell):
  - Direction: `>`
  - Time: \(1\).

- For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(2\).

- For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(3\).

- For `i = 4` (starting at the fourth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(4\).

#### Test Case 3:
- Grid: `<><<<<`
- Length: 6

- For `i = 1` (starting at the first cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(1\).

- For `i = 2` (starting at the second cell):
  - Direction: `>`
  - Time: \(4\).

- For `i = 3` (starting at the third cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(7\).

- For `i = 4` (starting at the fourth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(10\).

- For `i = 5` (starting at the fifth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(8\).

- For `i = 6` (starting at the sixth cell):
  - Direction: `<`
  - Time: \(1\).

### Detailed Breakdown

Let's break down the logic for each test case to ensure it aligns with the expected results.

#### Test Case 1: `><<`
- **i = 1**: Starting at `>`, it moves right to `>`, then left to `<`. Total time: \(3\).
- **i = 2**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(6\).
- **i = 3**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(5\).

#### Test Case 2: `<<<<`
- **i = 1**: Starting at `>`, it moves right to `>`, then left to `<`. Total time: \(1\).
- **i = 2**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(2\).
- **i = 3**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(3\).
- **i = 4**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(4\).

#### Test Case 3: `<><<<<`
- **i = 1**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(1\).
- **i = 2**: Starting at `>`, it moves right to `>`, then left to `<`. Total time: \(4\).
- **i = 3**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(7\).
- **i = 4**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(10\).
- **i = 5**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(8\).
- **i = 6**: Starting at `<`, it moves left to `<`, then right to `>`. Total time: \(1\).
