### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its logic to determine if it correctly calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid.

#### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function computes two lists, `A` and `B`, which store cumulative distances based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - `A` is computed forward, while `B` is computed backward.
   - The function then uses these lists to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Cumulative Distance Calculation**:
   - For `A`: It stores the cumulative distance from the current position to the nearest '>' character, considering the inversion of characters.
   - For `B`: It stores the cumulative distance from the current position to the nearest '<' character, also considering the inversion of characters.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The function iterates through each cell and uses the precomputed `A` and `B` lists to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of the pinball and adjusting the cumulative distances accordingly.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function correctly initializes `A` and `B` by iterating through the string `s` and computing the cumulative distances.
   - This part of the function seems to be correctly implemented and matches the expected behavior.

2. **Time Calculation Logic**:
   - The function uses the precomputed `A` and `B` lists to calculate the time for each cell.
   - The logic involves checking the direction of the pinball and adjusting the cumulative distances accordingly.
   - However, the original assessment pointed out that the logic is flawed and does not correctly account for the movement and inversion of characters.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     <><<<<
     ```
   - Expected output:
     ```
     1 4 7 10 8 1 
     ```
   - Let's verify the calculation for the third cell ('<'):
     - Initially, the pinball is at position 2 (index 1).
     - It moves to position 1 (index 0) in 1 second.
     - The character at position 0 is inverted from '<' to '>', so the next move will be to the right.
     - It moves to position 2 (index 1) in 1 second.
     - The character at position 1 is inverted back to '<', so the next move will be to the left.
     - It moves to position 3 (index 2) in 1 second.
     - The character at position 2 is inverted from '>' to '<', so the next move will be to the left.
     - It moves to position 4 (index 3) in 1 second.
     - The character at position 3 is inverted from '<' to '>', so the next move will be to the right.
     - It moves to position 5 (index 4) in 1 second.
     - The character at position 4 is inverted from '>' to '<', so the next move will be to the left.
     - It moves to position 6 (index 5) in 1 second.
     - The character at position 5 is inverted from '<' to '>', so the next move will be to the right.
     - It moves out of the grid at position 6 (index 5) in 1 second.
     - Total time: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 seconds.

   - The program incorrectly calculates this as 7 seconds, indicating a flaw in the logic.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the inversion and movement logic, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
