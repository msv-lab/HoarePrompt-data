Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for certain configurations of the grid. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the time is flawed and does not account for the correct movement and inversion of characters.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
<><<<>
```

The expected output is:
```
1 4 7 10 8 1 
```

However, the program's output for this input is incorrect. Let's analyze the movement for the third cell ('<'):

- Initially, the pinball is at position 2 (index 1).
- It moves to position 1 (index 0) in 1 second.
- The character at position 1 is inverted from '<' to '>', so the next move will be to the right.
- It moves to position 2 (index 1) in 1 second.
- The character at position 1 is inverted back to '<', so the next move will be to the left.
- It moves to position 3 (index 2) in 1 second.
- The character at position 2 is inverted from '>' to '<', so the next move will be to the left.
- It moves to position 4 (index 3) in 1 second.
- The character at position 3 is inverted from '<' to '>', so the next move will be to the right.
- It moves to position 5 (index 4) in 1 second.
- The character at position 4 is inverted from '>' to '<', so the next move will be to the left.
- It moves to position 6 (index 5) in 1 second.
- The character at position 5 is inverted from '<' to '>', so the next move will be to the right.
- It moves out of the grid at position 6 (index 5) in 1 second.

The total time taken is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 seconds, but the program incorrectly calculates this as 7 seconds.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not correctly handle the inversion and movement logic, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
