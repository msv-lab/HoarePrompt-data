Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. However, the logic in the program is flawed and does not correctly simulate the movement and inversion rules of the pinball as described in the problem statement. Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement**: The program attempts to calculate the distance between '>' and '<' characters but does not properly account for the pinball's movement and the inversion rule. For instance, the program does not handle the dynamic changes in the direction of the pinball as it moves through the grid and the subsequent inversion of the grid characters.

2. **Misinterpretation of Grid Movement**: The program tries to precompute distances and then uses these distances to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid. This approach is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the step-by-step movement of the pinball.

3. **Lack of Simulation**: The program lacks a proper simulation of the pinball's movement through the grid. Instead of simulating each step of the pinball's movement, it attempts to compute distances and then apply them, which does not correctly model the problem.

4. **Incorrect Output**: The output of the program does not match the expected results. For example, the sample input and output provided show that the program should output the exact time taken for each pinball to leave the grid, but the current implementation does not produce these results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the rules for the pinball's movement and thus cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
