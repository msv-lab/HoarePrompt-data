Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Movement Duration**: The logic for calculating the duration of the pinball's movement is flawed. The current implementation tries to handle the movement and inversion of directions but does not correctly compute the time taken for the pinball to exit the grid.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not properly handle edge cases where the pinball might move in a specific pattern that leads to exiting the grid. For example, it does not correctly manage the scenario where the pinball might get stuck in a loop or move in a way that exits the grid in a non-linear fashion.

3. **Inefficient and Overcomplicated Logic**: The current approach uses complex nested loops and conditions to try to predict the pinball's movement, which is overly complicated and likely to contain errors.

4. **Missing Correct Implementation**: The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem but does not follow the correct logic to determine the time taken for the pinball to exit the grid based on the given rules.

### Correct Approach:
A more straightforward and efficient approach would involve simulating the movement of the pinball for each starting position independently. This can be done by iterating through the grid and keeping track of the direction and position changes until the pinball exits the grid.

Here is a simplified version of how you could implement this:

```python
def simulate_pinball(s):
    n = len(s)
    results = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        pos = i
        steps = 0
        while 0 <= pos < n:
            results[i] = steps + 1
            steps += 1
            if s[pos] == '<':
                pos -= 1
                s = s[:pos] + '>' + s[pos+1:]
            else:
                pos += 1
                s = s[:pos] + '<' + s[pos+1:]
    return results

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    results = simulate_pinball(s)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))
```

This approach directly simulates the movement of the pinball for each starting position and calculates the time taken to exit the grid. It is simpler and more reliable for solving the given problem.
