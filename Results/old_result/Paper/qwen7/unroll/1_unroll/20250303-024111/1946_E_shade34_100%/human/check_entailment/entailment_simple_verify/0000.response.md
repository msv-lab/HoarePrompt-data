### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

1. **Initialization and Facts Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `facts` with the factorials of numbers up to 200001, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to calculate binomial coefficients efficiently.
   - This part is correct and necessary for calculating combinations later.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The program checks if the last index of the prefix maximums matches the first index of the suffix maximums, and if the first index of the prefix maximums is 1 and the last index of the suffix maximums is `n`. If these conditions are not met, it prints 0 immediately, indicating no valid permutation exists. This check is correct.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to calculate combinations using the precomputed `facts` list.
   - For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements between the current suffix maximum and the previous one.
   - Similarly, for each prefix maximum, it calculates the number of ways to place the remaining elements between the current prefix maximum and the next one.
   - Finally, it multiplies these values together to get the total number of valid permutations.

4. **Extended Euclidean Algorithm Functions:**
   - The `func_1` function implements the extended Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find the modular multiplicative inverse.
   - The `func_2` function uses `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of a number modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by another number.
   - These functions are not directly related to the problem but are used in the combination calculations.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately solves the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
