Output State: **d and c, where c and d are returned from func_1(b, a)**

Given the initial state, we know that `a` and `b` are positive integers with `a < b`, `gcd(a, b) = 1`, and `b â‰  0`. The function `func_1(b, a)` returns two values, `c` and `d`. The code snippet `return d, c` simply returns these two values. Therefore, the program returns `d` and `c`, which are the outputs of `func_1(b, a)`.
