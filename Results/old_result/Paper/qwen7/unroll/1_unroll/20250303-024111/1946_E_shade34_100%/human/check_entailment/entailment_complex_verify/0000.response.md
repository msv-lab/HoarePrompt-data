### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and compare it with the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - We need to determine the number of permutations of length `n` that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program should handle the constraints and compute the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes a list `facts` with factorials up to 200001, precomputed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m1`, `m2`, `p`, and `s`.
   - It checks if the last element of `p` matches the first element of `s` and if the first element of `p` is 1 and the last element of `s` is `n`. If these conditions are not met, it prints 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid permutations using the `func_2` function and the precomputed factorials.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function implements the extended Euclidean algorithm, which computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - The function is used in `func_2` to compute modular multiplicative inverses, but it is not directly used in the main logic for counting permutations.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then multiplies it by `a`.
   - However, the use of `func_1` here is not relevant to solving the permutation problem.

5. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic constructs the permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials to calculate combinations and counts the valid permutations.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the permutations match the given prefix and suffix maximums.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated code appears to correctly implement the logic for counting permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used appropriately within the context of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and solves the given problem as described.
