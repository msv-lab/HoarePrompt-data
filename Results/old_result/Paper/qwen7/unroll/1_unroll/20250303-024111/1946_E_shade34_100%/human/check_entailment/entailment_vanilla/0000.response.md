Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should output the count modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). The EEA is used to find the multiplicative inverse of a number modulo another number.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses the result from `func_1` to compute \( a^{-1} \mod b \) and returns \( a \times a^{-1} \mod b \).

3. **Usage of Functions**:
   - In the main logic, `func_2` is called with `b` as \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is the modulus value. This suggests that the function is intended to compute modular inverses.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The problem requires checking how many permutations can satisfy the given prefix and suffix maximums. However, the provided code does not contain any logic to solve this part of the problem. It only contains helper functions for modular arithmetic.

5. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The helper functions are correctly implemented for modular arithmetic, but they do not address the core problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.

### Conclusion

The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the main problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, it only provides helper functions for modular arithmetic, which are not used in the context of solving the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
