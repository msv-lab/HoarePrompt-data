Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that `a` >= `b`, gcd(`a`, `b`) = 1, and `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is not divisible by `b`; `b` is a positive integer such that `b` < `a`, gcd(`a`, `b`) = 1, and `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is not divisible by `b`; `c` is an integer, `d` is an integer, and they are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`**.

This means that after the code execution, `a` and `b` retain their original properties, and two new variables `c` and `d` are introduced as the return values from the function `func_1(b, a % b)`.
