Output State: **The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Given the initial conditions:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
- The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` is 1.
- `b` is not equal to 0.
- The current value of `a` is divisible by `b`.

The code snippet returns a tuple containing two elements:
1. The first element is `1`.
2. The second element is calculated as `-(a // b - 1)`.

To break down the calculation for the second element:
- `a // b` performs integer division, which gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`.
- Subtracting `1` from the quotient results in the expression `a // b - 1`.
- Taking the negative of this result gives us `- (a // b - 1)`.

Therefore, the program returns a tuple with the first element being `1` and the second element being the negative of the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b` minus `1`.
