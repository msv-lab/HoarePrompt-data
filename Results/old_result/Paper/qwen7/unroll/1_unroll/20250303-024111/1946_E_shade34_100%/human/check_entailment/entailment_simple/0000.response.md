### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly parses the input and validates the conditions for prefix and suffix maximums. Specifically, it checks if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is 1 and the last suffix maximum index is `n`.

2. **Combinatorial Calculations**:
   - The program uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. It calculates combinations using the `func_2` function, which in turn calls `func_1` to compute modular inverses and combinations.
   - The logic for calculating the number of valid permutations is sound, considering the constraints and the nature of the problem.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program performs all necessary calculations under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, which is correct for the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases appropriately, such as when there are no valid permutations (e.g., when the prefix and suffix maximum conditions are not met).

5. **Function Definitions**:
   - The definitions of `func_1` and `func_2` are correct and are used appropriately in the main logic of the program.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:

**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution states.
