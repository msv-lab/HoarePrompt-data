Output State: **The program returns d and c - a // b * d, where d and c are the results of the function call func_1(b, a % b), gcd(a, b) = 1, a >= b, and both a and b are positive integers.**

Explanation:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `a` >= `b`, gcd(`a`, `b`) = 1, and `b` is not equal to 0, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.
- `c` and `d` are the results of the function call `func_1(b, a % b)`. Since the function call details are not provided, we keep `c` and `d` as they are.
- The expression `a // b` gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`.
- Therefore, the program returns `d` and `c - (a // b) * d`.
