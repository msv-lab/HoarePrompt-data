Output State: **a and b are positive integers such that a is less than b, a >= b, gcd(a, b) = 1, and b is not equal to 0; c and d are returned from func_1(b, a)**

Explanation: The code `c, d = func_1(b, a)` calls the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `a` is less than `b`, `a >= b`, gcd(`a`, `b`) = 1, and `b` is not equal to 0, the function `func_1` returns two values `c` and `d`. These returned values replace the undefined values of `c` and `d` in the output state. All other conditions and relationships between `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
