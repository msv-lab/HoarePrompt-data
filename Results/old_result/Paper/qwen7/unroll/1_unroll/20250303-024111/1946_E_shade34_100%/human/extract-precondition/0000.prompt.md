You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .
