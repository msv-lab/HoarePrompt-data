Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of integers where the length of `b` is either equal to the number of prefix maximums (m_1) or the number of suffix maximums (m_2), `c` is the result of calling `func_1(b, 1000000007)` and `d` is the second return value from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.**

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with the list `b` and the constant `1000000007` as arguments, and it has returned two values which are now stored in `c` and `d`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the precondition regarding the length of `b` relative to the number of prefix or suffix maximums is still valid.
