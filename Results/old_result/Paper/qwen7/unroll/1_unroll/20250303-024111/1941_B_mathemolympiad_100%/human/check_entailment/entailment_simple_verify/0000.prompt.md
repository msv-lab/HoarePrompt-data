You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for all test cases, for each test case, the array `a` will be modified according to the operations defined within the loop. If at any point a negative number is encountered in the array `a`, the program will immediately print 'NO' and stop further processing for that test case. If the loop completes without encountering a negative number and the last two elements of the array `a` are both zero, the program will print 'YES'. Otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The final state of the array `a` will reflect these operations, and the output will consist of either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the program only checks if any element becomes negative during the operations and stops immediately if it does. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not account for the possibility that negative elements might become zero through subsequent operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The program's output for this input is "YES", but let's analyze whether this is correct according to the problem description.

1. Initial array: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=2`:
   - `a[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `a[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a[3] = 5 - 1 = 4`
3. Apply the operation at `i=3`:
   - `a[2] = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `a[3] = 4 - 2 = 2`
   - `a[4] = 2 - 1 = 1`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a[3] = 2 - 1 = 1`
   - `a[4] = 1 - 2 = -1` (negative value)

Even though the initial check does not trigger an immediate "NO" response, the presence of a negative value indicates that the array cannot be made entirely zero because further operations would lead to more negative values, which cannot be corrected to zero.

Therefore, the program fails to handle this scenario correctly and should return "NO" for this input. Hence, the program is incorrect.
