You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for all test cases, for each test case, the array `a` will be modified according to the operations defined within the loop. If at any point a negative number is encountered in the array `a`, the program will immediately print 'NO' and stop further processing for that test case. If the loop completes without encountering a negative number and the last two elements of the array `a` are both zero, the program will print 'YES'. Otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The final state of the array `a` will reflect these operations, and the output will consist of either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array of integers `a` of length `n` (where `3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`). For each test case, it checks if any element in the array `a` becomes negative after performing specific operations on consecutive elements. If any element becomes negative, it prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. If the array passes all checks (i.e., no negative elements and the last two elements are zero), it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return a value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numTest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Main Logic:**
   - It iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (i.e., `range(0, n - 2)`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `a[i]` is negative. If so, it prints 'NO' and stops further processing for this test case.
   - If `a[i]` is non-negative, it performs the operation:
     - `a[i] -= a[i]`
     - `a[i + 1] -= 2 * a[i]`
     - `a[i + 2] -= a[i]`
   - After performing these operations, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If not, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The logic inside the loop where the operations are applied seems to be incorrect. The operations should be applied to `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` instead of `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]`. This means the indices should be adjusted accordingly.

2. **Stopping Condition:**
   - The stopping condition (`stop = True`) is correctly implemented to stop processing if a negative value is encountered. However, the way the operations are applied might still lead to incorrect results due to the index mismatch.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check only considers the last two elements of the array. This might miss cases where other elements are non-zero but the last two are zero.

### Corrected Program:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Perform operations until no more can be done
        while True:
            stop = True
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                if a[i] > 0:
                    a[i - 1] -= 1
                    a[i] -= 2
                    a[i + 1] -= 1
                    stop = False
            if stop:
                break
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical errors in how the operations are applied and in the final check. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
