Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two variables `t` and `s` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and `s` is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500 inclusive. The function returns a result based on the value of `t` and the content of `s`.**
