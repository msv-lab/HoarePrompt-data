### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and checks if the current character is greater than the next character (i.e., `int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])`).
   - If such a condition is met, it increments the `count`.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The logic of counting the number of positions where the current character is greater than the next character is flawed. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of cuts required.
   - For example, consider the string "101". The code would count this as needing 1 cut (`1 > 0`), but actually, we can split it into "1" and "01" which requires only 1 cut.
   - The correct approach should be to find the position where the sequence changes from '0' to '1' and count the number of such transitions plus one (for the final segment).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Iterate through the string and count the number of times '0' changes to '1'.
   - The number of such transitions plus one will give the minimum number of cuts required.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

### Response:

Correctness: **False**
