Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit in the binary string and then adding one to this count. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. The logic fails to account for the fact that we need to ensure all '0's come before all '1's, which may require more complex cuts than just counting inversions.

To illustrate, consider the following examples:
- For the string "11010", the program would output 3 because there are two inversions ("10" and "10"). However, the correct answer is 3 pieces: ["11", "0", "10"].
- For the string "0110", the program would output 2 because there is one inversion ("11"). However, the correct answer is 2 pieces: ["0", "110"].

A correct solution would involve identifying the positions where the string transitions from '0' to '1' and counting these transitions plus one (for the initial segment).

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
