Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: 
   - A list `prefix_balance` is initialized to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`.
   - As the program iterates through the string, it calculates the balance at each position and appends the corresponding tuple to `prefix_balance`.
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it's ')', the balance is decremented.
3. **Sorting**:
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted using a key that sorts primarily by balance in ascending order and secondarily by position in descending order.
4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted tuples.
   - The characters are joined together to form the final result string.
5. **Output**:
   - The result string is printed as required.

Given the problem description and the implementation, the program appears to follow the steps correctly. It calculates the prefix balances, sorts them as specified, and constructs the balanced shuffle sequence.

Correctness: **True**
