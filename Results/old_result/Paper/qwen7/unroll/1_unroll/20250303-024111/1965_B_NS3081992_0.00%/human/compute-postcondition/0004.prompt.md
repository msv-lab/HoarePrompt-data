You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There is no variable defined in the provided function that corresponds to the problem description. The function `func_15` reads input and writes output but does not use the parameters `n` and `k` mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, we cannot extract a meaningful precondition related to the problem's variables from this function alone.
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers, each on a new line, where the number of lines is equal to the result of `func_10()`. Each number written to the stdout is the result of `func_14()` called once per iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value. It reads input and writes output but does not use the parameters `n` and `k` mentioned in the problem description.

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
