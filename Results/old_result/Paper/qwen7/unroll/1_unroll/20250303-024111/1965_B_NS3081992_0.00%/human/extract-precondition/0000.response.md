Precondition: **There is no variable defined in the provided function that corresponds to the problem description. The function `func_15` reads input and writes output but does not use the parameters `n` and `k` mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, we cannot extract a meaningful precondition related to the problem's variables from this function alone.**

To properly understand the precondition, we would need to see the definitions of `func_10` and `func_14`, or how they interact with the input parameters `n` and `k`. However, based on the given function, we can infer that:

- `func_10` likely returns the number of test cases.
- `func_14` likely handles the logic to generate and print the sequence for each test case.

Given the problem description, the precondition should be related to the input parameters `n` and `k` and their constraints. Since the function itself does not define these, we cannot provide a precondition here based solely on the given function.
