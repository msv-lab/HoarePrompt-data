Output State: **`lk` is the length of `bk`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the string `bk` and assigns it to the variable `lk`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
