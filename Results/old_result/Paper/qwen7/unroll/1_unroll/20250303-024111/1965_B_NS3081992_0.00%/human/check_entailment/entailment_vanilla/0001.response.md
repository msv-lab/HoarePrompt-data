Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - No subsequence of `a` should have a sum equal to `k`.
   - For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there must be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The sequence needs to cover all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.
   - The sequence can be of maximum length 25.

3. **Review of Functions:**
   - Most functions defined in the code are not used in the final solution (`func_1` to `func_14`).
   - `func_15` is the main function that processes the input and outputs the result.

4. **Analysis of `func_15`:**
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14` to generate the sequence.
   - `func_14` generates the sequence based on the values of `n` and `k`.

5. **Analysis of `func_14`:**
   - Converts `n` to its binary representation.
   - If `k` is 1, it handles a special case.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - Adjusting the sequence to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_14`:
- **Case `k == 1`:**
  - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
  - Otherwise, the sequence is `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`.
  - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 and covers all sums up to `n`.

- **Case `k > 1`:**
  - Constructs the sequence by adding powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k`.
  - Adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - Adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to further ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - Completes the sequence with additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_14` ensures that:
  - No subsequence sums to `k`.
  - All sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) are covered by some subsequence.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
