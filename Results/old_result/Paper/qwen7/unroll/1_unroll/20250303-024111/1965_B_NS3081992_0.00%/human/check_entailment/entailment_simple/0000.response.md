Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence of \(a\) sums to \(k\).
   - For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there exists a subsequence of \(a\) that sums to \(v\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_14()` is the primary function that constructs the required sequence based on the input \(n\) and \(k\).
   - It handles two cases:
     - When \(k = 1\), it generates a sequence that avoids sums of \(k\) and ensures all other sums from 1 to \(n\) are possible.
     - When \(k > 1\), it also generates a sequence ensuring the conditions are met.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - For \(k = 1\), the sequence generated is `[2, 3, 4, 8]` if \(n = 8\). This ensures no subsequence sums to 1 and all other sums from 1 to 8 are possible.
   - For \(k > 1\), the sequence construction involves binary representation and ensuring specific sums are avoided while allowing others.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The function `func_14()` correctly constructs the sequence based on the problem requirements.
   - The output format matches the problem specification, providing the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

5. **Execution State**:
   - The provided functions (`func_15`, `func_10`, etc.) handle input/output correctly and do not interfere with the core logic of constructing the sequence.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
