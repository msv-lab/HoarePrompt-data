Postcondition: **Output State: `na` elements are taken from `numbers` and added to `group_a`, `nb` elements are taken from `numbers` and added to `group_b`, `nc` elements are taken from `numbers` and added to `group_c`. The sum of elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`. All elements in `numbers` have been distributed, and the original order of elements in `numbers` has been preserved within their respective groups. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**
