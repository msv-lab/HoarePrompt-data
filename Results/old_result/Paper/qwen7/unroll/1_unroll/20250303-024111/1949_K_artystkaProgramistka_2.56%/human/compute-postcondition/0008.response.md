Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

This means that the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluated to True, confirming that the elements from `numbers` were correctly distributed into `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` such that the sums `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` satisfy the condition specified by `func_1`. Additionally, the function returns the boolean value `'YES'` along with the three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) which contain the elements from `numbers` as described in the initial state.
