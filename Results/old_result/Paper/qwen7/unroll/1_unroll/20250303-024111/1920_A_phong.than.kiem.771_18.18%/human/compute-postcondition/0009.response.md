Output State: **The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in the list `items` where `to_int` is True and `space` is True, meaning `line` is split into a list of strings stored in `items`.**

This means that the program will take the list of strings stored in `items` (since `space` is True and `to_int` is True), convert each string to an integer, and return a list of these integers.
