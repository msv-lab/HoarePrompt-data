Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can move from the starting position `(1, 1)` to the end position `(2, n)`.
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `n//2 - 1`).
   - If it finds a configuration where the robot would get stuck (specifically, if an arrow in the first row points left and the corresponding arrows in the second row point left or the next arrow points left), it immediately returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last few positions to ensure the robot can make the final moves to reach `(2, n)`.
   - If no such blocking configurations are found, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and input format.
   - The logic in `func_1` appears to correctly determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)` based on the given grid configuration.
   - The overall structure of the program matches the problem requirements and constraints.

Given the analysis, the program seems to be correct in terms of both logic and handling of the problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
