Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop counter) and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: 
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(n\) is even.
   - `row1` and `row2` are strings of length \(n\) consisting of characters `<` and/or `>`.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `t` iterations. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `t`, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results`) do not directly affect the loop's execution condition and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
