You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even. row1 and row2 are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        row1 = input()
        
        row2 = input()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
        
    #State: t elements in the results list, each element is the result of calling func_1(n, row1, row2) for each iteration of the loop with the respective n, row1, and row2 inputs.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: a string where each line is the result of func_1(n, row1, row2) for each iteration, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but instead uses predefined variables t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 2⋅10^5 and even), row1 (a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'), and row2 (a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'). The function returns a value based on the comparison of row1 and row2.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
