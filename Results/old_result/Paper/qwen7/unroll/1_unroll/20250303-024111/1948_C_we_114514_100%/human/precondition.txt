t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; row1 and row2 are strings consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either "<" or ">"; there are no arrows pointing outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
