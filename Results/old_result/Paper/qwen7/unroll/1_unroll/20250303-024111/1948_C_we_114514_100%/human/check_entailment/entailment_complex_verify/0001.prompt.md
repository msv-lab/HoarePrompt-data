You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the arrows in `row1` and `row2`.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`).
   - For each position `i` (where `i` ranges from `0` to `half_n - 2`), it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2 * i + 1` is `<` and if the corresponding arrows in `row2` at positions `2 * i` and `2 * i + 2` are also `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the last column in `row1` is `<` and the second last column in `row2` is `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'`.
   - If none of the conditions above are met, it returns `'Yes'`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, let's consider the logic and constraints:

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function only considers specific conditions where the robot cannot reach `(2, n)`. Specifically, it checks if the robot gets stuck in a loop or cannot move forward due to certain configurations of arrows.
   - However, the function does not cover all possible scenarios. For example, it does not check if the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements and down movements.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The function assumes that if the robot encounters a certain pattern (specifically, `<` in `row1` and `<` in `row2` for consecutive cells), it cannot reach `(2, n)`. This is a simplification and may not cover all cases.
   - The function does not account for more complex paths that the robot might take to reach `(2, n)`.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The problem states that `n` is even, which means the grid has an even number of columns. This is handled correctly in the function.
   - The function correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. It only checks for specific patterns that may prevent the robot from reaching the target cell. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

**Correctness: **False**
