Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even, `row1` and `row2` remain strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t`, `n`, `row1`, and `row2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
