You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'NO', 'YES', and 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between the k-th largest element and the f-th element in the sorted list a for each test case. For each test case, if the k-th largest element is greater than the f-th element, the output is 'NO'. If the k-th largest element is less than the f-th element, the output is 'YES'. If they are equal, the output is 'YES' unless the k-th element is the second largest element in the list (i.e., k is the last index), in which case the output is 'MAYBE'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \) along with a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then sorts the list \( a \) in descending order. After sorting, it compares the \( k \)-th largest element with the \( f \)-th element. If the \( k \)-th largest element is greater than the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'NO'. If the \( k \)-th largest element is less than the \( f \)-th element, it prints 'YES'. If they are equal, it prints 'YES' unless the \( k \)-th element is the second largest element in the list, in which case it prints 'MAYBE'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube is removed but the comparison is made with the wrong element in the sorted array. Specifically, the program checks if `a[k] > x` or `a[k] < x`, which is incorrect. It should check if the value at the `k`-th position after sorting is less than or equal to the value of the favorite cube. Additionally, the logic for determining whether the favorite cube is removed needs to consider the position of the favorite cube in the sorted array.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

The sorted array would be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (with value 3) is at index 1. After removing the first 2 cubes, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 2]`. In this case, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it compares the value at index 2 (`3`) with the value of the favorite cube (`3`), which should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could still be in the array after removal.

To fix this, the program should correctly determine the position of the favorite cube in the sorted array and then check if it falls within the range of cubes being removed.
