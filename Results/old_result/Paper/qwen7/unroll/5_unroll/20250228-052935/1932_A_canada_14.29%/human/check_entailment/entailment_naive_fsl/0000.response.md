Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for moving two cells at a time and ensuring that the destination cell does not contain thorns. The current implementation only allows moving one cell at a time and does not handle the case where moving two cells is allowed. For example, consider the following input:

```
10
.@@*@.**@@
```

In this case, the correct path would be to move from the first cell to the third cell (collecting a coin), then to the fifth cell (collecting another coin), and finally to the seventh cell (collecting the last coin). However, the program will only count the coins collected by moving one cell at a time, missing the opportunity to collect the coins at the third and seventh cells. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
