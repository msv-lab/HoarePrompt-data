You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first character of the string is always '.', indicating that the starting cell is empty.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        len = int(input())
        
        s = list(input())
        
        ret = 0
        
        thorn = 0
        
        for i in s:
            if i == '@':
                thorn = 0
                ret += 1
            elif i == '*':
                thorn += 1
                if thorn == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn == 0
        
        print(ret)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The variable `ret` is the number of coins collected before encountering two consecutive cells with thorns ('*'). If two consecutive thorns are encountered, the loop breaks and no more coins are counted for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where 't' is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 representing the number of test cases. For each test case, 'n' is an integer between 1 and 50 representing the length of the string, and the string consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters indicating empty cells, cells with a coin, and cells with thorns respectively, with the first character being '.'. The function returns a result based on the input data for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
