Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a string of length up to 50 containing '.', '@', and '*' characters. It counts the number of '@' (coins) characters in the string until it encounters two consecutive '*' (thorns) characters, at which point it stops counting. The function outputs the count of coins for each test case.**
