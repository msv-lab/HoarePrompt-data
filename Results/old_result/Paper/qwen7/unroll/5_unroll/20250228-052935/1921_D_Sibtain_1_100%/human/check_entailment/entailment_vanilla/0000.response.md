Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the sizes of arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of `a` and `b`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If all elements in `a` and `c` are the same, the program correctly prints `0` and continues to the next test case.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The program sorts `a` in ascending order.
   - It sorts `c` in descending order. This is crucial because sorting `c` in descending order ensures that we pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c` to maximize the differences.

4. **Pairing Elements:**
   - The program uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse `a` and `c` respectively.
   - It calculates the absolute differences between the paired elements and accumulates these differences into `ans`.

5. **Logic for Pairing:**
   - The logic for pairing elements seems to be flawed. The current implementation does not ensure that the differences are maximized. Instead, it pairs the smallest element of `a` with the smallest element of `c` and the largest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`. However, the goal is to maximize the total difference, which means we should ideally pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c` and vice versa.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the accumulated differences.

### Correctness Check:

Given the problem statement, the goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\). Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order and then pairing them as described in the program does not necessarily maximize the differences. 

A more effective approach would be to sort both arrays and then pair the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
