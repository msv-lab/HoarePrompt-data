Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n and m, along with two lists a and c. For each test case, it first checks if both lists contain identical elements. If so, it prints 0 and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it sorts list a in ascending order and list c in descending order. Then, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists a and c. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
