Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x`. In such a case, the GCD of the difficulties cannot be greater than 1, but the program might not always output 1.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 3
```
The correct output should be `1`, because the only way to split 7 into 3 parts is `[1, 1, 5]`, `[1, 2, 4]`, `[1, 3, 3]`, etc., and the GCD of these parts will be 1. However, the program might output a value other than 1 in this case, which would make it incorrect.
