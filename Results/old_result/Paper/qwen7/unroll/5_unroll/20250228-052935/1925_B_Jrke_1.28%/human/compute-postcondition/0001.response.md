Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x, and ans is the maximum value among 1, i, and x//i where i is an odd number between 1 and sqrt(x) inclusive, provided that both i and x//i are less than or equal to k (x//n).
