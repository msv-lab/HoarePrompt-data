### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
- The function works as expected and handles all four possible directions.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function checks if a player is in the same position as a Bludger.
- If so, it marks the player as eliminated by setting their position to `[-1, -1]`.
- It then prints a message indicating the player has been eliminated.
- The function sorts the players alphabetically before printing, ensuring the output is in the required order.

#### Main Logic:
- The main logic correctly initializes the field and reads the input.
- It processes each action in the game, updating the positions of players and the ball.
- It handles catching and throwing the Quaffle appropriately.
- It checks for scoring conditions and prints the appropriate messages.
- It correctly handles the elimination of players when they are hit by a Bludger.

Given the detailed analysis of the code and the annotated version, we can see that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed part of the solution and are used correctly within the context of the problem. They handle the necessary functionalities such as moving objects, checking for eliminations, and managing the game state.

The original assessment incorrectly stated that these functions were not part of the solution. However, upon closer inspection, these functions are essential components of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it implements the necessary functionalities to simulate the game according to the problem description.
