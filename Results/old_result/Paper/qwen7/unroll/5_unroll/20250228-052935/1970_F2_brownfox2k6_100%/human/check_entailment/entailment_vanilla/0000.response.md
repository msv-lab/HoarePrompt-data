### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`).
   - The function correctly handles the four possible directions: up (`U`), down (`D`), left (`L`), and right (`R`).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function checks for collisions with Bludgers and eliminates players accordingly.
   - The function iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players that are in the same position as a Bludger.
   - For each player found, the function appends the player's identifier to the `out` list and sets their position to `[-1, -1]` to mark them as eliminated.
   - The function then prints the elimination event for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically by player identifier.

Given the problem description, the functions seem to handle the basic logic required for eliminating players when they collide with Bludgers. However, the functions do not address the main requirements of the problem, such as handling scoring, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, and tracking the overall game state.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct in their specific tasks but are insufficient to solve the entire problem as described. They do not handle the main game mechanics like scoring, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, and tracking the overall game state.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Correctness: **False**
