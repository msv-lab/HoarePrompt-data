Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be part of the solution for the described problem. The problem requires handling the movements and interactions of players, balls, and bludgers on a Quidditch field, including scoring points and eliminating players. However, the given functions only handle moving an object up, down, left, or right, and eliminating players based on their positions relative to a bludger.

These functions do not address the core requirements such as:
- Handling the movement of players and balls.
- Catching and throwing the Quaffle.
- Scoring points by placing the Quaffle in the opposing team's goal.
- Eliminating players when they are hit by a Bludger.

Since these essential functionalities are missing, the program cannot correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
