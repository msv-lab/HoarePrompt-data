### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). The function handles the four possible directions: up (`U`), down (`D`), left (`L`), and right (`R`). The nested conditional structure ensures that the correct position update is made based on the direction provided.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
   - The function then prints the elimination event for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically by player identifier.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic correctly processes the game steps. It iterates through each step, updating the positions of players and the Bludger based on the given actions.
   - When a player catches the Quaffle (`C`), the `carry` variable is updated to the player's identifier.
   - When a player throws the Quaffle (`T`), the `carry` variable is reset to `None`, and the Quaffle is placed back at the player's position.
   - The program correctly checks if the Quaffle is placed in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - The program also correctly handles the elimination of players who collide with Bludgers and prints the appropriate messages.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct events in the correct order, including the scoring events and the final score.

Given the detailed analysis of the code and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct in their specific tasks, and the main program logic correctly implements the game rules and handles the required events.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct in their specific tasks.
- The main program logic correctly processes the game steps and handles the required events.
- The output is correct and in the required format.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

### Final: **True**
