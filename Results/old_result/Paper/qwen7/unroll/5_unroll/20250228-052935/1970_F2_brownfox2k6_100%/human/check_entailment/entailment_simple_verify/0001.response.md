### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It handles the four possible directions: up (`U`), down (`D`), left (`L`), and right (`R`). The logic is straightforward and correctly updates the coordinates of the entity.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function correctly identifies players that are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated. It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players in the same position as the Bludger, appends their identifiers to the `out` list, and updates their positions to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints the elimination event for each player in the sorted order of player identifiers.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic correctly processes the input and simulates the game step-by-step. It handles the following actions:
     - Players moving (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).
     - Players catching the Quaffle (`C`).
     - Players throwing the Quaffle (`T`).
     - Checking for collisions with Bludgers and marking players as eliminated.
     - Scoring points when a player successfully throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
     - Printing the appropriate events (scoring, eliminations) and the final score.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls. This confirms that the functions and the main logic are implemented as intended.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented for their specific tasks, and the main program logic correctly handles the game mechanics as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are correct in their specific tasks.
- The main program logic correctly handles the game mechanics, including scoring, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, and tracking the overall game state.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

### Final: **True**
