Output State: **`obj` is a list of two integers where the second element is incremented by 1, `d` is 'R'.**

Explanation: The code `obj[1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `obj` by 1. The first element of `obj` remains unchanged, and the value of `d` remains 'R' since it was specified that `d` is not 'L' and its current value is 'R'.
