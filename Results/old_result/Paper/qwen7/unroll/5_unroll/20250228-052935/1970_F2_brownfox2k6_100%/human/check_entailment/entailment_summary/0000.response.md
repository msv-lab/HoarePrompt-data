Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The code correctly initializes the positions of the goals (`rg` and `bg`), the ball (`ball`), the Bludger (`blud`), and the players (`player`). This part of the code is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

2. **Game Loop**: The game loop iterates over the number of steps `T` and processes each action. The logic for handling different types of actions (moving, catching, throwing) is implemented correctly. Specifically:
   - **Catching a Ball**: When a player catches the ball, the `carry` variable is set to the player's identifier, and the ball's position is updated to the player's position.
   - **Throwing the Quaffle**: When a player throws the Quaffle, the `carry` variable is reset to `None`, and the ball's position is updated to the player's position.
   - **Moving**: The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of the ball, Bludger, or player based on the direction specified.
   - **Elimination**: The `func_2` function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as the Bludger, marks them as eliminated, and prints the appropriate message. The players are sorted alphabetically before printing.

3. **Scoring**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the ball is moved to the center of the field. The correct team is identified based on the goal.

4. **Final Score**: The final score is printed correctly after processing all the steps.

Given that all parts of the code adhere to the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the overall implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
