Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` for each test case, where each test case includes a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, it returns information based on the list `a`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes these inputs without needing them as function parameters and provides some form of output based on the list `a` for each test case.
