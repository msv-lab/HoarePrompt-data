Output State: T is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, the variable `cur` is set to the second smallest number in the sorted list `N` if there are at least two numbers that appear exactly once in `N`. If no such number exists or all numbers appearing more than once, `cur` is set to the smallest number in `N` that appears exactly once. If no such number exists, `cur` remains -1.
