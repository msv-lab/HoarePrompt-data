Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice and Bob's Moves**: 
   - The problem specifies that Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, whereas Bob can only pick and delete elements from `a`. The current implementation does not simulate these moves correctly.
   
2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` by sorting and checking gaps, but it does not simulate the game's turns properly. It directly calculates the MEX without simulating the optimal moves of both players.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The logic inside the loop where it tries to increment `cur` and check conditions does not accurately reflect the game's rules. Specifically, it doesn't account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and the optimal strategies they would use.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game's turns and ensure that Alice and Bob make their optimal moves. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Turns**:
   - Alice should always try to maximize the MEX, so she should pick the smallest available unique number.
   - Bob should minimize the MEX, so he should pick the smallest available number that would minimize the MEX.

2. **Track the MEX**:
   - Use a set to keep track of the numbers already picked by Alice and Bob.
   - Determine the MEX at the end based on the numbers left in the array `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn: pick the smallest unique number
        a.sort()
        mex = 0
        
        # Simulate Alice and Bob's turns
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                if a[i] != mex:
                    mex += 1
                    i += 1
                else:
                    i += 1
            else:  # Bob's turn
                i += 1
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the game's turns and ensures that both players play optimally according to the problem statement.
