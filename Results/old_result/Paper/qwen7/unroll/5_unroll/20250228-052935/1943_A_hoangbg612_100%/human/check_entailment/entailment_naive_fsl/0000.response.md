Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly. Here is a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would result in a final MEX value of 2. However, the provided program does not simulate the game correctly and instead calculates the MEX based on the sorted order of the elements in the array. This leads to incorrect results.

For the given input, the program will output 0 instead of 2, as it does not account for the alternating turns and the optimal strategy of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
