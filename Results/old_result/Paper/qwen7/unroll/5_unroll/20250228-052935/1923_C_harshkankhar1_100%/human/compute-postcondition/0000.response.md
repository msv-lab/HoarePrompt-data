Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `q` is an integer obtained from input split and converted to int, `t` is a positive integer, an array `c` and its length `n` remain unchanged, and `q` subarray queries defined by pairs of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where 1 <= `l_i` <= `r_i` <= `n` remain unchanged.**

This means that the values of `t`, `c`, and the subarray queries remain unchanged. The variables `n` and `q` have been updated to their respective integer inputs from the user.
