Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed during the execution of the loop based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` for each input pair `(x, y)` provided by the user. The initial state of the variables `a` and `b` remains unchanged except for the values updated within the loop based on the input pairs. The first element of list `b` (`b[0]`) is always `0`. The lists `a` and `b` are modified during the loop based on the input values, but their initial structure and the condition checking in the loop are the key factors determining the output.
