Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers based on a given number `n`.
   - The function handles the base case where `n` is 0 by returning `(0, 0)`.
   - For non-zero `n`, it calculates `size_overlap` which is used to construct the sequence.
   - The sequence construction logic involves appending integers to `sequence` based on the `size_overlap` value.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with a modified `n`.

2. **Recursive Sequence Construction**:
   - The recursive calls ensure that the sequence is built correctly to match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is constructed in such a way that it ensures the exact number of increasing subsequences matches the input `n`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The main part of the program reads test cases and calls `func_1` to generate sequences.
   - The generated sequence is printed along with its length.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The function handles edge cases like `n = 0` correctly by returning `(0, 0)`.
   - The sequence generation logic ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `n`.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` and the main program logic appear to be correctly implemented to generate sequences with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
