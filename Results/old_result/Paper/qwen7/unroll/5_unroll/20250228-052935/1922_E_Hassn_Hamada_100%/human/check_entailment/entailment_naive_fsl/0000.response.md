Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be designed to generate a sequence based on a binary representation of the input number `n`, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `X = 37`

The expected output for this case would be an array that has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. However, the provided code does not guarantee this. For instance, the sequence generated might not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences. A more appropriate approach would involve generating a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences can be precisely controlled, such as using a sequence with repeated elements in a specific pattern.

Since the provided code does not ensure that the generated array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all valid inputs, the program is incorrect.
