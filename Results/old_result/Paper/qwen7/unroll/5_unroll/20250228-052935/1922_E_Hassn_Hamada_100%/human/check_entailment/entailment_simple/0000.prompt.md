Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to -1. Given that `sequence` is not specified, we use the default value of 0, so the loop runs from 0 down to -1. However, since the loop starts from 0 and goes down, the first iteration sets `i` to 0. 
    #
    #For `i = 0`:
    #- `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which is 1.
    #- `value` is calculated as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` which simplifies to `(1 << 2) - (1 << 0)` or `4 - 1` which equals 3.
    #- The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` checks if `8 - 1` (which is 7) is less than or equal to `number`. If `number` is greater than or equal to 7, `size` is incremented to 2 and `value` becomes 4. But regardless of `number`, the `if` condition `value <= number` will always be true for `value = 3` when `i = 0`, so `size_overlap` is set to `(1, 0)` and the loop breaks. Since no other iterations change this, the final state is `size_overlap` is (1, 0).
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: size_overlap is (1, 0), sequence is (1, 2, 3, ..., size-1)
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
