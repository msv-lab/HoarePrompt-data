Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]**.

Explanation: The provided code is a docstring (a multi-line comment) that describes the function's purpose and arguments. It does not contain any executable statements that would alter the values of `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the initial states of these variables remain unchanged.
