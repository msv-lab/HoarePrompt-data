Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `number`, which is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and a parameter `sequence`, which is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. After executing the function body, the function returns two values, both of which are 0.**
