Output State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 0)**

Explanation: The code assigns the tuple `(1, 0)` to the variables `size` and `overlap`. This means that `size` is 1 and `overlap` is 0. The initial state of `size_overlap` being `(1, 0)` is updated to this new tuple, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state remains that `size_overlap` is (1, 0).
