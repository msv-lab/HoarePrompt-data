Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being initialized by `range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1)`.

2. **Understand the Range Function**: The `range` function generates a sequence of numbers starting from `max(sequence, default=0)` and ending at `-1` (exclusive), with a step of `-1`. This means the loop will iterate over all integers from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is determined by `max(sequence, default=0)`. This ensures that if `sequence` is negative or zero, `i` will start from `0`.

4. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than `-1`. Since the loop iterates down to `-1`, the loop will execute as long as `max(sequence, default=0)` is non-negative.

5. **Adjust the State**: Given the initial state where `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, we need to ensure that the loop can start. This means `max(sequence, default=0)` should be greater than `-1`.

6. **Conclusion**: The only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution is `i`, which is initialized by `max(sequence, default=0)`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `max(sequence, default=0)` is greater than `-1`.

State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), `max(sequence, default=0)` must be greater than -1**
