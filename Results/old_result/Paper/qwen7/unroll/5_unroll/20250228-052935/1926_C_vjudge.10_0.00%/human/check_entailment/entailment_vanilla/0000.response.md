Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `soma` to 0.
   - It reads the number of test cases `N`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - For each `n`, the program iterates through all numbers from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each number `i` in this range, it calls `func_1(i)` and adds the result to `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits.
   - It converts the number to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums these values.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Range of Iteration:**
   - The program iterates from `0` to `n-1`. However, the problem states that Vladislav writes integers from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - Therefore, the loop should start from `1` instead of `0`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum of digits for each number from `0` to `n-1` and accumulates this sum in `soma`.
   - Since the problem requires the sum of the digits of numbers from `1` to `n`, the loop should start from `1`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 to n inclusive
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
    soma = 0  # Reset soma for the next test case
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has an issue with the range of iteration. It needs to start from `1` instead of `0`. After correcting this, the program will correctly compute the sum of the digits for numbers from `1` to `n` for each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False** because it does not correctly handle the range of numbers to be processed.

Correctness: **False**
