Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem, we need to replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits and then compute the sum of these new values. However, the program is currently calculating the sum of the digits for each number from 0 to \( n-1 \), which is not what the problem requires.

To fix this, the program should iterate through each number from 1 to \( n \) and calculate the sum of its digits. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        soma += func_1(i)
    print(soma)
    soma = 0

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
```

This corrected version will correctly compute the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits.
