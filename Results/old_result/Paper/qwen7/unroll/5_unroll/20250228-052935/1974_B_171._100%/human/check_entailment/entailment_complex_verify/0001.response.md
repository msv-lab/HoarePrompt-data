### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This part is correct and handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Step 1: Extract Unique Characters**: 
     - It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Step 2: Create Mapping**:
     - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique characters list is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
       - The mapping logic is correct. For example, if `unique_chars` are `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - **Step 3: Decode String**:
     - It decodes the encoded string `b` using the `char_map` and returns the decoded string.
       - The decoding logic is correct. Each character in `b` is replaced by its symmetric character from the `char_map`.

4. **Output**:
   - The decoded strings are printed correctly.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the operations performed by the program.
- The `func_1` function accurately performs the required steps to decode the string based on the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or issues identified in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
