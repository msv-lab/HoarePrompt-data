### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates through the test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string `b`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Step 1: Extract Unique Characters**: It correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string `b` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Step 2: Create Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique characters list is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - **Step 3: Decode String**: It decodes the encoded string `b` using the `char_map` and returns the decoded string.
4. **Output**: The decoded strings are printed correctly.

Given the problem description and the provided solution, the program appears to follow the steps correctly and should work as expected.
