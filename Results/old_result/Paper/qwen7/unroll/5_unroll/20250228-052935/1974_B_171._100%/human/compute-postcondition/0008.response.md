Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of `encoded` is between 1 and 200,000. The function returns a string `decoded`, which is created by mapping each character in `encoded` using a given dictionary `char_map` and then joining these mapped characters together.**
