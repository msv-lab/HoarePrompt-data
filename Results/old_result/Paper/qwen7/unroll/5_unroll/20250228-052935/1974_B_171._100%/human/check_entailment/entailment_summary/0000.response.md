Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and then splits it into individual components. This approach ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program extracts the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself) and passes it to the `func_1` function for decoding.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - **Unique Characters Extraction and Sorting**: It extracts all unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - **Creating the Mapping Dictionary**: It creates a dictionary (`char_map`) where each unique character is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list of unique characters.
   - **Decoding the String**: It decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its mapped counterpart from the `char_map`.

4. **Output**: The decoded strings for all test cases are collected in a list and printed one by one.

Given the detailed explanation and the execution summary, the provided program correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the specified algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
