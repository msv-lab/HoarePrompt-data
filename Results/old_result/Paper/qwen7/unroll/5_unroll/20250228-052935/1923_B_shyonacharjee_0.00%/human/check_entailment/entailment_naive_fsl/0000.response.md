Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that after firing bullets, the remaining alive monsters move towards the player. This movement needs to be considered to ensure the player does not get killed.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

According to the problem description, the player can take the following actions:

1. In the first second, fire 1 bullet at the 1st monster and 1 bullet at the 3rd monster. This results in the 1st monster dying, and the 3rd monster moving to position 2.
2. In the second second, fire 2 bullets at the 2nd monster. This results in the 2nd monster dying.
3. In the third second, fire 2 bullets at the 3rd monster. This results in the 3rd monster dying.

However, the provided program does not simulate these movements and thus may incorrectly determine that the player can survive. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
