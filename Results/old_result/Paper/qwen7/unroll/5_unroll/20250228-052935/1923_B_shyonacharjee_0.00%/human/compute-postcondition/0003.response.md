Output State: t test cases are processed, for each test case, we check if it's possible to defeat all monsters given the constraints on bullets and time. If it's possible for all test cases, the output is 'YES', otherwise it's 'NO'. The specific 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case depends on the input values of n, k, healths, and positions.
