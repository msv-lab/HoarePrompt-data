Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem description. The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. However, the given code does not implement any logic related to this requirement. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The expected output would be a distribution of bets that satisfies the condition, such as `27 41 12`. However, the provided code does not generate such an output. Instead, it focuses on calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers, which is irrelevant to the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
