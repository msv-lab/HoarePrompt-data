Output State: **The final value of result after applying the function func_1 successively to the elements of numbers starting from the second element.**

This means that the `result` starts with the first element of the `numbers` list and then successively applies the `func_1` function to `result` and each subsequent element in the `numbers` list. The final value of `result` after all iterations is the output state.
