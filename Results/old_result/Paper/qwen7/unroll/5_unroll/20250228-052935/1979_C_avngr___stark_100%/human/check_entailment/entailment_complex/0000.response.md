Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a way to distribute the coins so that the sum of the bets is less than the product of each bet and its corresponding multiplier.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b` using the formula `abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`. Given the constraints (2 <= a, b <= 20), this function correctly computes the LCM.
   - **Function `func_2(numbers)`**: This function computes the LCM of all the multipliers in the list `numbers` using the `func_1` function. It iteratively applies `func_1` to each pair of multipliers, ensuring the final result is the LCM of all multipliers.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers.
   - It calls `func_2` to compute the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible bet for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome.
   - It checks if the sum of these maximum bets is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the main program is sound and correctly implements the requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The use of `func_1` and `func_2` ensures that the LCM calculation is handled correctly, which is crucial for determining the maximum possible bet for each outcome.
   - The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
