Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Calculation of Combinations**: The code calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, this calculation is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand. 

2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value per excursion is \(\frac{k}{\text{total number of pairs}}\), because each pair is chosen with equal probability.

3. **Summation of Friendship Values**: The code incorrectly sums up the friendship values and applies the modular inverse in a way that doesn't reflect the expected value calculation.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Sum of friendship values
        total_friendship_value = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            total_friendship_value += f
        
        # Expected value of the sum of friendship values
        expected_value = (k * total_friendship_value) % MOD
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs during the excursions.
