### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem statement to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
- For each pair of friends, their friendship value increases by 1 each time they are chosen.
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for a pair of friends after k excursions is \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)} \times \text{friendship value}\).
- We need to sum this expected value for all pairs of friends.

#### Given Program Recap:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)
```

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly model the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: While the modular inverse `c` is correctly calculated, it is not used in the right context.
3. **Summation Logic**: The summation logic is flawed because it does not account for the expected value calculation properly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Calculate the modular inverse `c` of the total number of possible pairs.
2. For each pair of friends, calculate the expected increase in friendship value as \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)} \times \text{friendship value}\).
3. Sum these expected values for all pairs of friends.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            s += f
        expected_value = (c * k * s) % M
        print(expected_value)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends.

### Final Evaluation:
Since the given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
