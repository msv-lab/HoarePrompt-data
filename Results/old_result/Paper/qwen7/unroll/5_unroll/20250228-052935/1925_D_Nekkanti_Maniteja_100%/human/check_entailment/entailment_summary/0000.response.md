Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
3. It calculates \(c\) as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(M = 10^9 + 7\).
4. It initializes \(s\) and \(a\) to 0, where \(a\) accumulates the sum of friendship values from the given pairs.
5. It iterates through the \(m\) pairs of friends and adds their friendship values to \(a\).
6. For each of the \(k\) excursions, it updates \(s\) using the formula \(s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\).
7. Finally, it prints the result of \(s \mod M\).

However, the formula used in the program does not match the problem's requirements. Specifically, the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently. The correct approach involves calculating the probability of picking each pair and updating the expected value accordingly.

Given the provided code, the formula used seems to be an approximation rather than the exact expected value calculation. The correct expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
