Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used for modulo operations.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of possible pairs, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0, which will store the sum of friendship values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, which will accumulate the sum of friendship values from the input.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program iterates through the `m` pairs of friends.
   - It reads the indices `u`, `v`, and the friendship value `f` for each pair.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The program calculates `c * i * c * m + c * a` for each of the `k` excursions.
   - This calculation seems to be an attempt to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - However, the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly model the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The result `s` is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) before printing.

### Correctness Analysis:

The key issue with the given program is the formula used to calculate the expected value. The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any excursion is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends after `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Summing Up the Expected Values:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in `k` excursions is the sum of the expected increases for each pair of friends.

Given these considerations, the correct approach would involve calculating the expected value for each pair of friends and summing them up.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
