### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the main issue with the given program: the formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the given problem. Let's break down the correct approach and why the original program is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:

1. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability of any specific pair of friends being chosen in any single excursion is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - Since the friendship value increases by 1 for each excursion when a pair of friends is chosen, the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends after `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Summing Up the Expected Values:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value is \(\frac{k}{n(n-1)} \times f_i\), where \(f_i\) is the initial friendship value.
   - Summing this up for all pairs of friends gives the total expected value.

The correct formula should be:
\[ \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( \frac{k}{n(n-1)} \times f_i \right) \]

#### Issues with the Given Program:

1. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly model the expected value. It incorrectly multiplies and adds terms that do not reflect the actual expected increase in friendship values.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The modular inverse `c` is correctly calculated as \((n \cdot (n-1) // 2)^{-1} \mod M\), but it is not used correctly in the summation.

3. **Summation Logic:**
   - The program sums up the friendship values `a` for all pairs, but it does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values for each pair of friends.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly solve the problem. The formula used to calculate the expected value is incorrect, and the summation logic is flawed.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
