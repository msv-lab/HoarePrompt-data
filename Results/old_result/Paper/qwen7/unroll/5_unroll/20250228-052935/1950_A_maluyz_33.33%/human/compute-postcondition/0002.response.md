Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each input triplet (a, b, c):

- If \(a < b < c\), the line will contain 'STAIR'.
- If \(a == b == c\), the line will contain 'NONE'.
- If \(b\) is the maximum value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the line will contain 'PEAK'.
- Otherwise, the line will contain 'NONE'.

The exact content of these lines will depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
