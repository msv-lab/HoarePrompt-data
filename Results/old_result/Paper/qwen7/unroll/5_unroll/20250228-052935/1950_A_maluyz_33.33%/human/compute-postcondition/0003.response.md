Output State: The output state will consist of strings printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. For each iteration, if `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'; if `a == b == c`, it prints 'NONE'; if `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The exact sequence of these strings depends on the input values provided for each iteration.
