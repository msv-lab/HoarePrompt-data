Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since we need indices `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative.
     - If `b[i]` is negative, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
   - It then updates the array elements according to the operation:
     - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0)
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are non-zero. If either `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Operation Application:**
   - The program incorrectly applies the operation `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2` and `b[i+2] -= b[i]`. According to the problem statement, the correct operation should be:
     - `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
     - `a_i = a_i - 2`
     - `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`
   - The current implementation does not follow these rules.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made zero is flawed. The program only checks the last two elements after the loop, but it should check if all elements are zero.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Apply the operation until no more operations can be applied
        while True:
            changed = False
            for i in range(1, a - 1):
                if b[i] >= 2:
                    b[i-1] -= 1
                    b[i] -= 2
                    b[i+1] -= 1
                    changed = True
            if not changed:
                break
        
        # Check if all elements are zero
        if all(x == 0 for x in b):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the specified operation and does not properly check if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
