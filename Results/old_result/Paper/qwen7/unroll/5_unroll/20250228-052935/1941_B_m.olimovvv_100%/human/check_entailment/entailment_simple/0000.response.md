Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. **Operation Simulation**: The program simulates the operations described in the problem statement. It iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (since the operation is only defined for indices between 1 and `n-2`). During each iteration, it checks if the current element `b[i]` is non-negative. If any element becomes negative, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
4. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program performs a final check to ensure that the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are not, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the array might become negative during the operations, which would prevent all elements from becoming zero.

Given the logic and the way the program handles the operations and checks, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
