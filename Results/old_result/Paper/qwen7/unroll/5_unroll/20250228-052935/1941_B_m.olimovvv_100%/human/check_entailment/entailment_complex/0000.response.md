Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, followed by the size of the array `n` and the array elements themselves. This part is correct.

2. **Operation Simulation**: The program simulates the operation by iterating through the array from index 0 to `n-3`. For each index `i`, it performs the specified operations:
   - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`
   - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`
   - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which effectively sets `b[i]` to 0)

3. **Negative Value Check**: If at any point during the iteration, `b[i]` becomes negative, the program immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. This check ensures that the array remains non-negative throughout the operations.

4. **Final Validation**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES', indicating that the array can be made zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as when the array is already zero or when the operations cannot make all elements zero due to negative values appearing during the process.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
