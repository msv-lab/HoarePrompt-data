Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, each line representing the result of one test case. For each test case, if \( b > a \), the output is calculated as \((b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k + (n - k) * a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \). If \( b \leq a \), the output is simply \( a * n \). The number of lines equals the number of test cases provided in the first line of input.
