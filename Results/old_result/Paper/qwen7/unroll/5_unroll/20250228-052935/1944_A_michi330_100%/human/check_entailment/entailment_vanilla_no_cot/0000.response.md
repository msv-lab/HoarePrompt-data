Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically:

1. **Case where \( k < n-1 \):**
   - If \( k < n-1 \), the logic should determine how many components (groups of islands that are still connected) can be formed after destroying \( k \) bridges.
   - The current implementation simply prints \( n \) when \( k < n-1 \), which is incorrect. Instead, we need to consider the optimal way to split the graph into components.

2. **Graph Theory Insight:**
   - When \( k < n-1 \), the goal is to find the smallest number of islands that can be isolated from the rest.
   - If \( k \geq n-1 \), then all bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable, so the answer is 1.
   - If \( k < n-1 \), the strategy is to destroy bridges such that the graph is split into the maximum number of components, with the goal of isolating as many islands as possible.

To fix this, we need to calculate the minimum number of islands that can be isolated. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of islands that can be isolated
            min_islands = math.ceil((n - k) / (k + 1))
            print(min_islands)

func()
```

This corrected function ensures that the minimum number of islands that can be isolated is calculated properly, handling all edge cases correctly.
