Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the conversion of hours correctly for times between 13:00 and 23:59. Specifically, it fails to convert hours greater than 12 properly into the 12-hour format. For example, the time `13:45` should be converted to `01:45 PM`, but the program incorrectly handles this case. Here's a specific example:

- Input: `13:45`
- Expected Output: `01:45 PM`
- Actual Output: The program does not provide the correct output for this case.

This failure indicates that the program does not correctly implement the logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all possible inputs.
