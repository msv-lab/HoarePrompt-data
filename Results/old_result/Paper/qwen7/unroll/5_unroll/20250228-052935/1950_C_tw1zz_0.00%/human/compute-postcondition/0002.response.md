Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1 : m AM/PM". The specific times printed depend on the input provided during the loop's execution. For each input "hh:mm", the code converts "hh" to 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly. The minutes "m" remain unchanged, and the output includes both "AM" and "PM" times based on the original "hh" value.
