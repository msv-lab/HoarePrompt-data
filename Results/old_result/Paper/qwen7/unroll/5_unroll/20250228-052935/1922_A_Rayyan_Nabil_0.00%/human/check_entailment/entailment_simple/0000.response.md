Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but has a logical flaw in its implementation. Specifically, the program checks if for every character position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]`. This logic is incorrect because the problem requires that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. The current logic would incorrectly return 'YES' even if `a` and `b` match `c` and only fails when `a` and `b` do not match `c`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check if there exists at least one position `i` where `a[i]` matches `c[i]` and `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, and another position `j` where either `a[j]` or `b[j]` does not match `c[j]`. If such positions exist, then the answer is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'.

Given this analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
