Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5) where each integer a_i (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and a list of integers. The function processes these inputs according to specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
