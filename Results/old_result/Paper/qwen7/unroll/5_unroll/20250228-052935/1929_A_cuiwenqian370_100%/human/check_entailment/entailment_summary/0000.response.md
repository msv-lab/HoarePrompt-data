Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
- The provided `func_1` function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty because it does not consider rearrangements of the array elements.
- To maximize the beauty, we should place the largest and smallest elements at the ends of the array and sort the rest in ascending order. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases by reading input and calling `func_1`. However, `func_1` needs to be modified to achieve the correct solution.
- Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided `func_1` function does not correctly solve the problem as stated. We need to modify `func_1` to rearrange the array elements to maximize the beauty.

Since the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
