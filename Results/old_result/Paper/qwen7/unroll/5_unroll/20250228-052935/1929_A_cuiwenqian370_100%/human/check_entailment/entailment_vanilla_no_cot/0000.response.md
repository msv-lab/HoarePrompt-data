Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty of the array. The problem requires maximizing the expression \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\), which can be achieved by strategically arranging the elements to maximize positive differences and minimize negative ones.

To solve this correctly, we should sort the array and then place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, ensuring that the difference between consecutive elements is maximized. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    # Place the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end
    array[0], array[-1] = array[-1], array[0]
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += array[i] - array[i - 1]
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

This approach ensures that the beauty of the array is maximized by leveraging the sorted order and strategic placement of the smallest and largest elements.
