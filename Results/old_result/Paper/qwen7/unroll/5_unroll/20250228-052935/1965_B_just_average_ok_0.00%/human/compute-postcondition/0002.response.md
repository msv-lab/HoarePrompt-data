Output State: The number of elements in `nums` list will vary based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, but it will always be 3. The elements in `nums` will be [k - (1 << (idx-1)), k + 1, k + (1 << (idx-1)) + 1], where `idx` is the highest index such that \(1 << idx \leq k\). After removing \(1 << idx\), the list will contain these three specific values for each test case.
