Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and k. The function verifies that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers within the ranges 2 to 10^6 and 1 to n respectively. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. The function returns a result based on the validity of the inputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers (t, n, k), and checks if they meet the specified constraints. It then returns results indicating the validity of these inputs for each test case.
