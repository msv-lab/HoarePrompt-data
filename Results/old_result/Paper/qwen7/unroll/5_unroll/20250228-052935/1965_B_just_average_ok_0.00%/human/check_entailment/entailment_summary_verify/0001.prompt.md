You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it checks if t is within the range 1 to 1000 and if n and k are within their respective valid ranges. It then constructs a list `nums` containing three specific values based on the value of k and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is that it outputs the number of elements in `nums` (which is always 3) and the elements themselves for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it meets the requirements of the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - It correctly reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Generating Sequence**:
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with values `[1 << i for i in range(24)]`. This creates a list of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It then finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - It removes this value from `nums` and appends `k - 2^{\text{idx}}`, `k + 1`, and `k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1` to `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `nums`, which is at most 25.
   - It then prints the elements of `nums`.

### Checking Against Requirements

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The sequence includes `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` and `2^{\text{idx}} + 1`, ensuring that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because any subsequence involving `k - 2^{\text{idx}}` and `2^{\text{idx}} + 1` would include `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values Except `k`**:
   - The sequence includes all powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\), plus additional values to ensure all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed.
   - The sequence `nums` is designed to cover all possible sums from 1 to `n` except `k` using the properties of binary representation and the inclusion of specific values.

### Edge Cases and Constraints

- The constraints ensure that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(10^7\).
- The sequence generation logic ensures that the maximum length of the sequence is 25, meeting the requirement.

### Conclusion

The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and that all other sums from 1 to `n` can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
