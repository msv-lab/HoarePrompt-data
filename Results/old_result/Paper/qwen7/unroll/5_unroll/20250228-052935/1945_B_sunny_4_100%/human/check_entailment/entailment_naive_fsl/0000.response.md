Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously using the formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula does not correctly account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. Specifically, the formula does not ensure that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated accurately.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

According to the problem description, the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and the second installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes. Both fireworks are visible for 4 minutes after launch. The expected output is 2 because the first and second installations will launch fireworks at different times, and they will not overlap within the visibility period.

However, the program calculates:
- `A = m // a + 1 = 4 // 6 + 1 = 1`
- `B = m // b + 1 = 4 // 7 + 1 = 1`
- `ans = A + B + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`

This calculation results in an incorrect output of 4, which is not the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
