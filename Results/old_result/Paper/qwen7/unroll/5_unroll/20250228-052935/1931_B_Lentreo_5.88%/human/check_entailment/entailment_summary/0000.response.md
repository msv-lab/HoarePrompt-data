Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers in the list is zero. However, this approach is flawed. The correct approach to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same is to check if the total amount of water is evenly divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, it means that each container can have the same amount of water, which is the total amount divided by `n`. 

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers, which does not relate to the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
