Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of cases, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers in the list. If this cumulative sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
