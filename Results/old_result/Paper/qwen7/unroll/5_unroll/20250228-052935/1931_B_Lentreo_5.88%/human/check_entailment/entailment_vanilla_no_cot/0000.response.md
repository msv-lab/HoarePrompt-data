Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program is flawed and does not accurately check the condition required to solve the problem.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to verify if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers. This means checking if the average amount of water per container (total water divided by the number of containers) can be achieved by pouring water between containers. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if the average water per container can be achieved
        if total_water % n == 0 and all((x - avg_water) % n == 0 for x in nums):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

```

This corrected program checks if the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers and verifies if each container can be adjusted to have the average amount of water without leaving any remainder.
