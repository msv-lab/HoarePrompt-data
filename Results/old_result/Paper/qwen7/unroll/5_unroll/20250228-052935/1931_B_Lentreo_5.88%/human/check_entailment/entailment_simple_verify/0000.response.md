### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and correctness.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container stored in `nums`.
- It sets `last` to the last element of `nums`.
- It initializes `curr` to 0.
- It iterates through each element in `nums`, adding the difference between the current element and `last` to `curr` if the current element is non-zero.
- If `curr` is 0, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the difference between the last element and each other element sums to zero, which is not a valid approach.

#### Corrected Version:
A correct implementation should involve calculating the average amount of water per container and checking if all containers can reach this average through the allowed operations. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if all containers can reach the average amount of water
        if all(a == avg_water for a in nums):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Evaluation:
- The original program incorrectly assumes that the sum of differences between elements and the last element being zero implies that the containers can be made equal. This is not true because the operations only allow transferring water from one container to another where the index of the source is less than the index of the destination.
- The corrected version calculates the average amount of water per container and checks if all containers can reach this average. This is a valid approach because the operations allow redistributing water to achieve an equal distribution.

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect, and the corrected version is correct.

### Final:
**False**
