You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        last = nums[-1]
        
        curr = 0
        
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the t test cases. For each test case, 'YES' is printed if the cumulative sum of non-zero differences between consecutive numbers in the list is zero, otherwise 'NO' is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the difference between the last element and each other element sums to zero, which is not a valid approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```
The program will calculate the differences and check if they sum to zero, but this does not guarantee that the containers can be made equal. A correct solution would involve checking if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water from higher to lower containers.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the average amount of water per container and checking if all containers can reach this average through the allowed operations. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if all containers can reach the average amount of water
        if all(a == avg_water for a in nums):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version calculates the average amount of water per container and checks if all containers can reach this average, ensuring the program works correctly according to the problem description.
