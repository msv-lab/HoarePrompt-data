### Reasoning:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by checking if the cumulative sum of non-zero differences between consecutive numbers in the list is zero. However, this approach is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the amount of water poured must be from a container with an index less than the target container's index.

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The code calculates the difference between each element and the last element in the list (`last = nums[-1]`).
   - It then sums these differences (`curr += i - last`), but this doesn't correctly reflect the problem's requirements.
   - The logic `if curr == 0` checks if the sum of these differences is zero, which is not a valid approach to solving the problem.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers.
   - This means checking if the average amount of water per container (total water divided by the number of containers) is an integer and if each container can reach this average through the allowed operations.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - Calculate the total amount of water.
   - Check if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`).
   - If yes, it is always possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers. If no, it is not possible.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(nums)
        
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# State: Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each of the t test cases. For each test case, 'YES' is printed if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, otherwise 'NO' is printed.
```

### Conclusion:

The original solution is incorrect because it does not properly address the problem's requirements. The corrected solution checks if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers, which is the correct approach.

**Correctness: **False**
