Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where both players can potentially end up with the same maximum score after k turns. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3 3 1 2
  1 3 2
  5 1 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 1, and Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: `a[1] = 5`
    - Bodya moves to position `p[1] = 1` (stays at the same position).
    - Sasha's score: `a[2] = 1`
    - Sasha moves to position `p[2] = 3`.
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: `5 + a[1] = 5 + 5 = 10`
    - Bodya moves to position `p[1] = 1` (stays at the same position).
    - Sasha's score: `1 + a[3] = 1 + 2 = 3`
    - Sasha moves to position `p[3] = 2`.
  - After the third turn:
    - Bodya's score: `10 + a[1] = 10 + 5 = 15`
    - Bodya moves to position `p[1] = 1` (stays at the same position).
    - Sasha's score: `3 + a[2] = 3 + 1 = 4`
    - Sasha moves to position `p[2] = 3`.

- **Final Scores:**
  - Bodya's final score: `15`
  - Sasha's final score: `4`

- **Output of the Program:**
  - The program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because it does not properly simulate the game for all possible moves and scores.

### Explanation of the Issue:
The program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible moves and scores. It assumes that the maximum score will be achieved by moving to the position with the highest value in the array `a`. However, the correct solution requires simulating all possible moves and calculating the maximum score for both players after k turns.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly simulate the game for all potential cases, particularly when the optimal moves for both players lead to different final scores. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
