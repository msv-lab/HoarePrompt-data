Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of length n; a is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i; YES is a string equal to 'YES'; NO is a string equal to 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code defines two string constants `YES` and `NO`. These constants do not affect the values of the other variables, so their initial conditions remain unchanged. The output state includes all the initial conditions along with the new definitions of `YES` and `NO`.
