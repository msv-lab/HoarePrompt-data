### Reasoning:

The original assessment provided a detailed and accurate analysis of the given Python program. Let's break down the key points to confirm the correctness:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.read` to read the entire input at once and then processes it. This approach is correct for handling multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program correctly extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. This formula is correct because:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start from the year immediately after `last_year`.
     - The division and multiplication ensure that we get the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The calculated year for the nth sign is stored in the `results` list.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - The program correctly formats the output by joining the results and writing them to the standard output.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the steps involved, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.
