Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the data list starting from the position specified by `index`.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The value of `T` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, `T` is still an integer from the data list starting from the position specified by the new value of `index`, which is 2.
