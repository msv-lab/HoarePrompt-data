### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), the target amount of water in each container would be `total / n`, where `total` is the sum of water in all containers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean becomes negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot achieve equal distribution without violating the pouring rule (since we would need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more, which is not allowed).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning "NO".
   - However, the program's approach to checking if it's possible to redistribute the water such that no negative difference occurs during the process is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks the cumulative difference at each step, but it does not ensure that the water can be poured from a higher-water container to a lower-water container while maintaining the index constraint.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only checks the cumulative difference and does not ensure that the pouring operation respects the index constraint (i.e., pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index).
   - The program assumes that if the cumulative difference remains non-negative, the redistribution is possible, but this is not necessarily true due to the index constraint.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct. The program fails to ensure that the pouring operations respect the index constraint (i.e., pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). Therefore, the program may incorrectly return "YES" in some cases where it is not possible to equalize the water amounts under the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
