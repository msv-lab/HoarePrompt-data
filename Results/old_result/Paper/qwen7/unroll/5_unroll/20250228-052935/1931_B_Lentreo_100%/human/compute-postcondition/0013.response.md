Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` representing the amounts of water in each container. It calculates the mean amount of water per container. If at any point during the iteration, the cumulative difference between the current sum of `nums` and the mean becomes negative, it returns 'NO', indicating that equal distribution is not possible. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES', indicating that the water can be distributed equally among the containers.**
