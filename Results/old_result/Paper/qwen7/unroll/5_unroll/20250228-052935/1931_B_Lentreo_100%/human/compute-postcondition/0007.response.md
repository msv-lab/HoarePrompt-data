Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter and typically starts from 0 in most programming languages when using `range(n)`.
   - The variable `n` is the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `i` is the loop counter, it should start from 0.
   - `n` should be set to the length of `nums`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `curr`, `total`, `mean`, and `sum(nums)` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of `nums`**
