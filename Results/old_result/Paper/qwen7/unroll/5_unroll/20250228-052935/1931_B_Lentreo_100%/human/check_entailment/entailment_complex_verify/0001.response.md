### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), the target amount of water in each container would be `total / n`, where `total` is the sum of water in all containers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean becomes negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot achieve equal distribution without violating the pouring rule (since we would need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more, which is not allowed).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning "NO".
   - The program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that no negative difference occurs during the process.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The input handling and loop structure are appropriate for the given constraints.

However, there is a critical flaw in the algorithm. The function `func_1` only checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean becomes negative at any point. This check alone is not sufficient to ensure that the water can be redistributed according to the given pouring rule (from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container).

To illustrate the flaw, consider the following example:

```
Input:
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

- The total amount of water is `15`, and `n = 5`, so the mean is `3`.
- The function will calculate the cumulative difference:
  - After the first container: `1 - 3 = -2` (negative, but this is just a local check)
  - After the second container: `-2 + 2 - 3 = -3` (negative, but still a local check)

This check fails to ensure that the water can be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container. In this case, the function will incorrectly return "NO" because the cumulative difference becomes negative, even though it is theoretically possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have 3 units of water.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the water can be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container. The check for cumulative differences being negative is insufficient to guarantee the correct redistribution.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
