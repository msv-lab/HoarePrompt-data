### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index must be less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), the target amount of water in each container would be `total / n`, where `total` is the sum of water in all containers.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the mean amount of water per container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the mean becomes negative at any point. If it does, it means we cannot achieve equal distribution without violating the pouring rule (since we would need to pour water from a container with less water to a container with more, which is not allowed).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, returning "NO".
   - The program correctly checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that no negative difference occurs during the process.

5. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The input handling and loop structure are appropriate for the given constraints.

However, there is a subtle issue with the function's approach. The function assumes that if the cumulative difference `curr` ever goes negative, it is impossible to equalize the water. This assumption is not entirely correct because the problem allows pouring water from any container to any other container, not just from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed one.

To illustrate, consider the following scenario:
- Containers: [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]
- Total: 15
- Mean: 3

If we start with the first container (4) and pour 1 unit to the fourth container (1), we get:
- [3, 5, 2, 2, 3]

Now, if we pour 1 unit from the second container (5) to the third container (2), we get:
- [3, 4, 3, 2, 3]

At this point, the cumulative difference `curr` is still non-negative, but we can continue to pour water until all containers have 3 units.

Therefore, the function should not rely on the cumulative difference becoming negative to determine impossibility. Instead, it should simply check if the total sum is divisible by `n` and ensure that the mean can be achieved by redistributing the water according to the rules.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate in its analysis of the problem and the function's logic. However, the function's implementation does not fully capture the flexibility of the pouring rules. The function should not return 'NO' based on the cumulative difference becoming negative but rather focus on the divisibility of the total sum by `n`.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
