Output State: **`pre` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two zeros; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers; `prefix` is a list where each element at index i (starting from 0) is the XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to i; `suf` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `suf` as a list of 32 lists, where each inner list contains two zeros. This does not affect the values of `pre`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `prefix`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
