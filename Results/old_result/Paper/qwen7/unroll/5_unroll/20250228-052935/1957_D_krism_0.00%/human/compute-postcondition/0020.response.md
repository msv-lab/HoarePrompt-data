Output State: `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` from 0 to 31, after all iterations of the loop. The variables `pre` and `suf` are updated such that for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `pre[j][0]` is incremented by the number of times `c >> j & 1` is 0, and `suf[j][1]` is decremented by the same count; conversely, `pre[j][1]` is incremented by the number of times `c >> j & 1` is 1, and `suf[j][0]` is decremented by the same count.
