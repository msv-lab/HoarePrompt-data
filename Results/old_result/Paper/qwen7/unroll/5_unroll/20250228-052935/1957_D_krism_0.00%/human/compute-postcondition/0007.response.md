Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
- `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `prefix` is a list where each element at index \(i\) (starting from 0) is the XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to \(i\).

The `print(arr, prefix)` statement will print the original list `arr` and the `prefix` list.

To describe the values printed:

- `arr` contains integers derived from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `prefix` is constructed such that each element at index \(i\) is the cumulative XOR of all elements from index 0 to \(i\) in `arr`.

Given these descriptions, the output will be:

Output: **[arr], [prefix]**
