Output State: `pre` remains unchanged, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf` remain unchanged. For each inner list in `suf`, the first element (number of zeros) is incremented 32 times for each bit position where `cur >> j & 1` is false, and the second element (number of ones) is incremented 32 times for each bit position where `cur >> j & 1` is true, based on the value of `prefix[i]` for `i` ranging from `n` to `1`.
