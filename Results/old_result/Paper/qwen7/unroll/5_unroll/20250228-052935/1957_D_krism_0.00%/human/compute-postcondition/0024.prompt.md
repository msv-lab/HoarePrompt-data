You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    #This is printed: -----------------
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers; `prefix` is a list where each element at index i (starting from 0) is the XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to i.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [arr], [prefix]
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `pre` is a list of lists where each inner list has its first element incremented by 1 for 32 times; `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf` remain unchanged.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: `pre` remains unchanged, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf` remain unchanged. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, `suf[j][0]` contains the count of positions in `prefix` where the `j`-th bit is 0, and `suf[j][1]` contains the count of positions where the `j`-th bit is 1.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: pre (where pre retains its previous value)
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [[suf[0][0], suf[0][1]], [suf[1][0], suf[1][1]], ..., [suf[31][0], suf[31][1]]]
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` from 0 to 31, where `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` are incremented based on the bits of `prefix[i]`, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are decremented accordingly for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variables `pre`, `suf`, `prefix`, and `arr` are updated during the loop execution, but their exact values are not specified in the initial state.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for k from 0 to 31)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided data.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
