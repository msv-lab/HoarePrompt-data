Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t, an integer n, and a list of n integers. It calculates and returns a result for each test case based on the XOR properties of the input list and the counts of bit positions in the prefix XOR array. Specifically, it computes the sum of products of counts of zeros and ones for each bit position across the prefix XOR array.**
