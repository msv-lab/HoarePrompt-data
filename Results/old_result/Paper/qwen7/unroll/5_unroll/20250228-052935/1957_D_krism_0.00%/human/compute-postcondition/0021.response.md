Output State: `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` from 0 to 31, where `pre[j][0]` and `pre[j][1]` are incremented based on the bits of `prefix[i]`, and `suf[j][0]` and `suf[j][1]` are decremented accordingly for each `i` from 1 to `n`. The variables `pre`, `suf`, `prefix`, and `arr` are updated during the loop execution, but their exact values are not specified in the initial state.
