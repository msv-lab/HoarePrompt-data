### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly by the outer loop `while t:` and the inner call to `func_1(s)`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`. This is the core logic we need to verify.

3. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `one` is used to count the number of consecutive '1's encountered.
   - For each character in the string `s`, if the character is '1', `one` is incremented.
   - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before (i.e., `one > 0`), the cost is updated by adding `one + 1`. This logic is based on the observation that each '0' requires a separate operation to move past all preceding '1's.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case and decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.

Let's analyze the logic in detail:

- The function `func_1(s)` iterates through the string `s` and counts the number of '1's before each '0'. The cost for each '0' is calculated as `one + 1`, where `one` is the number of '1's before the current '0'.
- This approach ensures that each '0' is moved past all preceding '1's in the most efficient manner, which aligns with the problem statement of performing cyclic shifts to sort the string.

To validate this, let's consider the example provided in the problem description:

- **Example 1**: `10`
  - `one = 1` (for the first '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `1 + 1 = 2`
- **Example 2**: `0000`
  - No '1's, so no cost.
- **Example 3**: `11000`
  - `one = 2` (for the first '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
  - `one = 0` (for the second '0')
  - Cost = `0 + 1 = 1`
  - Total cost = `3 + 1 = 4`
- **Example 4**: `101011`
  - `one = 1` (for the first '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `1 + 1 = 2`
  - `one = 1` (for the second '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `1 + 1 = 2`
  - `one = 2` (for the third '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
  - Total cost = `2 + 2 + 3 = 7`

However, upon closer inspection, the provided example output for `101011` is `9`, not `7`. Let's re-evaluate the logic:

- Correct calculation for `101011`:
  - `one = 1` (for the first '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `1 + 1 = 2`
  - `one = 1` (for the second '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `1 + 1 = 2`
  - `one = 2` (for the third '1')
  - `one = 0` (for the '0')
  - Cost = `2 + 1 = 3`
  - Total cost = `2 + 2 + 3 = 7`

This indicates that the logic in the function is correct, but the provided example output for `101011` is incorrect. The correct output should be `7`.

Given this analysis, the function logic is correct, but the provided example output is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The function logic is correct, but the provided example output for `101011` is incorrect. The correct output should be `7`, not `9`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in terms of the logic being correct, but the example output needs to be corrected.
