Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `s` or `cost`, the initial state of `s` remains unchanged, and `cost` is explicitly set to 0.
