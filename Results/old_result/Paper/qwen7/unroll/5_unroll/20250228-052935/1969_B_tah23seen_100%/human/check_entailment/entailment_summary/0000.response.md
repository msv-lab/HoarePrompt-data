Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Here's how the program works:

1. The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function with the binary string `s`.
3. The `func_1` function initializes a `cost` variable to zero and a `one` counter to zero.
4. It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
   - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the `cost`.
5. After processing the entire string, it returns the `cost`.

This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost because:
- Each '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's must be moved to the beginning of the sequence of '1's to maintain the non-decreasing order.
- The cost of moving a '0' to the beginning of a sequence of '1's is the length of the sequence of '1's plus one (for the '0' itself).
- Summing these costs for all '0's gives the minimum total cost.

Given the execution summary and the explanation of the program, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
