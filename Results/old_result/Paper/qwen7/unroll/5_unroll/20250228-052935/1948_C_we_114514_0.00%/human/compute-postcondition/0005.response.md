Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of test cases. Each test case contains three elements: an integer `n` (even and between 2 and 2â‹…10^5), and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>' representing arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. Based on the given conditions, the function returns a list named 'results' containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the second row becomes reachable.**
