Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
3. The logic in `func_1` checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row using the given arrows. Specifically, it checks if the robot can move right in the first row until it reaches the end or if it can move to the second row via an arrow pointing down.
4. The function correctly updates the `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` flags based on the arrows in the grid.
5. After processing all test cases, the function returns a list of results indicating whether the robot can reach the target cell for each test case.

Given the logic and the state information provided, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
