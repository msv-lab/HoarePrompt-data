### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description:
- The task is to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- The program should output "YES" if it is possible, and "NO" otherwise.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is divisible by 2.
- If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Condition `n >= m`:**
   - This condition ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
   
2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`:**
   - This condition ensures that the difference between the number of moves added and removed is even.
   - Since each move adds or removes exactly one cube, the total number of moves must be even to balance out to exactly `m` cubes.

#### Examples:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is True.
  - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True because `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0`.
  - Output: "YES"
  
- **Test Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `n >= m` is False.
  - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` does not apply since the first condition is not met.
  - Output: "NO"
  
- **Test Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `n >= m` is True.
  - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` is True because `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0`.
  - Output: "YES"

The provided program and the function summary accurately reflect the logic needed to solve the problem. The conditions ensure that the number of moves is sufficient and balanced to achieve exactly `m` cubes.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.
