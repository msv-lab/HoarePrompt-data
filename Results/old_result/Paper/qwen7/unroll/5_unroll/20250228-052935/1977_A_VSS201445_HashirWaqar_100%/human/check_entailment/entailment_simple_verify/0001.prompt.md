You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' strings printed based on the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n >= m` for each test case provided by the user. Each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `m`, and the loop will execute `int(input())` times, where `input()` reads the number of test cases from the user.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes left in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the net effect of these moves must result in `m` cubes.
   - If we denote the number of moves to add a cube as `add` and the number of moves to remove a cube as `remove`, then `n = add + remove` and the net effect is `add - remove = m`.

3. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because you can't have more cubes than the total number of moves.
   - The difference between the number of add moves and remove moves should be equal to `m`. This means `(add - remove) = m`.
   - Since each add and remove move changes the count by 1, the difference `m` must be even if we consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the total moves `n`.

4. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Verification**:
   - The condition `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to achieve `m` cubes.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even, which aligns with the requirement that the net effect of add and remove moves results in an even change when `n` is considered.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Correctness:
**True**
