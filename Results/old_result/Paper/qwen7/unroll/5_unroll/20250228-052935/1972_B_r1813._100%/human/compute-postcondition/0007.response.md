Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s`. If the count is odd, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for `t` test cases.**
