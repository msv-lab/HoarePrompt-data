### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads input from standard input and processes it.
   - The input is read using `sys.stdin.read`, which reads all input at once and then splits it into parts.
   - The variable `t` is correctly set to the number of test cases.
   - The loop iterates over each test case, correctly setting `n` and `s` for each case.

2. **Counting 'U' Characters**:
   - The code counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` using `count_u = s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner**:
   - The condition `if count_u % 2 == 1:` checks if the count of 'U' characters is odd.
   - If the count is odd, it prints 'YES', indicating Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating Bob wins.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the edge case where the count of 'U' characters is odd, ensuring Alice wins.
   - The logic also handles the case where the count is even, ensuring Bob wins.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements, printing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the count of 'U' characters in the input strings.

### Correctness:
**True**
