Let's reason through the program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads each value of `x` within the specified range (2 ≤ x ≤ 1000).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the value of `y` such that `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 2.
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x` is divisible by `y` (`x % y == 0`).
   - If `x` is divisible by `y`, it further checks if `2 * y >= x`.
     - If true, it returns `y` immediately because this ensures `gcd(x, y) + y` is maximized.
     - If false, it updates `max_val` to `y` but does not return immediately.
   - After the loop, it returns `max_val`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of the function is almost correct but has a flaw.
   - The condition `2 * y >= x` is unnecessary and incorrect for maximizing `gcd(x, y) + y`.
   - Instead, the goal should be to maximize `gcd(x, y) + y`, which means finding the largest `y` that divides `x`.

4. **Optimization**:
   - The correct approach would be to start with `y = x // 2` and check downwards until `y` is found.
   - This ensures that we get the largest possible `y` that divides `x`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles edge cases like when `x` is prime or small values.

Given these points, the current implementation is flawed due to the unnecessary condition `2 * y >= x`. Let's correct the function:

```python
def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    for y in range(x // 2, 0, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            return y
    return 1  # In case no divisor is found (should not happen within the given constraints)
```

With this corrected function, the program will now correctly find the maximum `y` that satisfies the condition.

**Conclusion:**
The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary condition `2 * y >= x`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
