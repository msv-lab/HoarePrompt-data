Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. 

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` aims to find the largest \( y \) that satisfies the condition.
   - It iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 (since \( y < x \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and \( 2y \ge x \), it returns \( y \).
   - Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to the current \( y \).

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints \( 2 \le x \le 1000 \).
   - The logic ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \) and checks if \( 2y \ge x \), which is a valid condition to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function returns the largest divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to half of \( x \), which aligns with the requirement to maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Given this analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic to find the required \( y \) for each \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
