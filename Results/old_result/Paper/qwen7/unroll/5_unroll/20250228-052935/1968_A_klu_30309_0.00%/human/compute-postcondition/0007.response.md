Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to half of `x`. It iterates through possible values of `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 2, checking if `y` is a divisor of `x` and if `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it returns `y`; otherwise, it continues the search and updates the maximum value found. If no suitable `y` is found, it returns the maximum value found during the iteration.**
