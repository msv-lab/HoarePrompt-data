Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `x`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500.

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), the value is calculated as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a`.

### Checking the Solution Against the Problem Description

#### Problem Constraints:
- \( 1 \le a_i \le 10^9 \)
- \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \)

#### Provided Solution:
- The solution sets \( a[0] = 500 \).
- Each subsequent element \( a[i] \) is set to \( a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] \).

#### Verification:
- Let's verify if this approach meets the constraints and requirements.

1. **Initial Value:**
   - Setting \( a[0] = 500 \) ensures that the initial value is within the allowed range.

2. **Subsequent Values:**
   - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \):
     - \( a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] \)
     - This ensures that \( a[i] \ge a[i - 1] \), so \( a[i] \bmod a[i - 1] \) will always be less than \( a[i - 1] \).
     - Since \( x[i - 1] \) is an integer between 1 and 500, \( a[i] \) will be at most \( a[i - 1] + 500 \), which is well within the limit of \( 10^9 \).

3. **Modulo Condition:**
   - By construction, \( a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] \) implies \( a[i] \bmod a[i - 1] = x[i - 1] \), which matches the requirement \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

### Conclusion

The provided solution correctly initializes the array and fills it in such a way that the modulo condition is satisfied. Therefore, the solution is correct.

**Correctness: True**
