Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if the generated array `a` satisfies the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program:
1. The program initializes `a[0]` to 500.
2. For each subsequent element in the array `a`, it sets `a[i]` to `a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

Now, let's verify if this logic meets the required condition:
- For \(i = 2\), we have \(x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1\). According to the program, \(a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 500 + x_1\). Therefore, \(x_2 = (500 + x_1) \bmod 500\).
- For \(i = 3\), we have \(x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2\). According to the program, \(a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = (500 + x_1) + x_2\). Therefore, \(x_3 = ((500 + x_1) + x_2) \bmod (500 + x_1)\).

This pattern continues for all \(i\). However, the key issue is that the value of \(a_i\) is always constructed in such a way that it is at least \(500 + x_1 + x_2 + \ldots + x_{i-1}\), which means \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) will generally not equal \(x_i\) unless \(x_i\) is specifically chosen to fit within the modulo operation, which is not guaranteed by the construction method.

Given the example in the problem statement, the provided solution does not necessarily satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\).

Therefore, the program is not correct based on the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
