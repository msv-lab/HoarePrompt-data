Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Specifically, the program sets \( a_0 = 500 \) and then calculates \( a_i \) as \( a_{i-1} + x_{i-1} \). This approach does not guarantee that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program will generate:
```
500 502 506
```
However, \( 506 \bmod 502 \neq 1 \), which violates the requirement.

A correct solution would involve setting \( a_1 \) to a value that satisfies \( x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1 \), and then iteratively setting subsequent values to ensure the condition holds.
