Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects the number of test cases `num` as an input, but it should directly read the number of test cases from the input without any additional inputs. It also reads the number of elements `a` in each test case incorrectly and splits the input string into a list of strings rather than integers.

2. **Sorting and Picking Minimums**: The program sorts the list of numbers but then only appends every second element to `list2`. This approach does not ensure that the minimum values are being added to the score correctly. Instead, it should pair up the smallest available numbers and sum their minimums.

3. **Output**: The program prints the intermediate sums of `list2` instead of the final score after all operations.

### Correct Implementation:
Hereâ€™s how you can correctly implement the solution:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = sorted([int(data[index + i]) for i in range(2 * n)])
        index += 2 * n
        
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This implementation correctly processes the input, sorts the numbers, and pairs them optimally to maximize the score.
