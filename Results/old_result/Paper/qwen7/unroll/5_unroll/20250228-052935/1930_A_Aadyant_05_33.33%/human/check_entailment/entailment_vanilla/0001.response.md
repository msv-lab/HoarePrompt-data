### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers from the list and adding the minimum of the pair to the score.
   - The goal is to perform this operation `n` times, where `2n` is the total number of integers.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `a` which is the number of pairs (i.e., `2n`).
   - It then reads a string of space-separated integers and splits them into a list `list1`.
   - The list `list1` is sorted.
   - A new list `list2` is created containing every other element from the sorted list `list1`, starting from the first element.
   - The sum of elements in `list2` is appended to the output list `out`.
   - Finally, it prints each element of `out`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The code assumes that the input is always correctly formatted and does not handle invalid inputs gracefully.
   - The logic for selecting pairs is flawed. Instead of selecting the minimum of each pair, it selects every other element from the sorted list.
   - The approach does not ensure that the minimum of each pair is selected, which is required to maximize the score.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the score, we should sort the list and then pair the smallest and largest remaining elements, ensuring the minimum of each pair is added to the score.
   - This can be achieved by iterating through the sorted list and pairing elements from both ends towards the center.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
