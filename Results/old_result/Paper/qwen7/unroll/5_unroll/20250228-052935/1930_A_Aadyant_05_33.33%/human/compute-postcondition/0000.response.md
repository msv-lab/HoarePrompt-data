Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input integer, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the numbers on the whiteboard remain as described in the initial state.
