Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`n = 2`, `k = 2`): The program correctly prints `1 1`. This is because there are exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts (both are `[1, 1]`).
   - For the second test case (`n = 3`, `k = 1`): The program prints `69420 69 420`. This is a valid solution since only one cyclic shift `[69, 420, 69420]` is sorted.
   - For the third test case (`n = 3`, `k = 2`): The program incorrectly prints `-1`. However, a valid solution exists, such as `[69420, 69, 420]` where two cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function logic is flawed when `k >= 2` and `n != k`. It always prints `-1`, which is incorrect. As shown in the third test case, there can be arrays where `k` cyclic shifts are sorted even if `n != k`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - When `k >= 2` and `n != k`, we need to construct an array where exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted. One way to achieve this is by creating a sequence that has the required number of sorted shifts. For example, for `n = 3` and `k = 2`, we can use `[69420, 69, 420]` where the cyclic shifts `[69, 420, 69420]` and `[420, 69420, 69]` are sorted.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not handle the case where `k >= 2` and `n != k` correctly.

Correctness: **False**
