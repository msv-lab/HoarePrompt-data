Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains elements that cannot be broken down into smaller digits in a way that allows the array to be sorted. Specifically, the program does not check if the resulting array after breaking down the elements can be sorted. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store results. It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` but does not use the result of `func_1()`. This is incorrect because the results of `func_1()` should be stored in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself.
   - It splits the array into individual digits and stores them in a list `c`.
   - The function checks if the current element is greater than 10 and attempts to break it down into its constituent digits.
   - However, the function does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted. It simply checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted without considering the original array's structure and the operations allowed.

3. **Sorting Check**: The function sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `a`. This is incorrect because the original array `a` might not match the sorted list `c` after breaking down elements. The function should instead check if the original array `a` can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4
  12 3 45 67
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  The program does not correctly handle this case and may output `NO` because it does not properly simulate the transformation process.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the transformation process and check if the original array can be sorted through the allowed operations.
