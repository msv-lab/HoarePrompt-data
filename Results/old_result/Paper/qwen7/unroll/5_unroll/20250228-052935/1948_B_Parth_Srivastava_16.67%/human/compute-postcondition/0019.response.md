Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it creates a list c by appending elements based on specific conditions involving the digits of the integers in the list a. It then sorts the list c and checks if c is equal to its sorted version. If c is equal to its sorted version, it appends 1 to the list b; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return anything directly but modifies the list b based on the comparison result.**
