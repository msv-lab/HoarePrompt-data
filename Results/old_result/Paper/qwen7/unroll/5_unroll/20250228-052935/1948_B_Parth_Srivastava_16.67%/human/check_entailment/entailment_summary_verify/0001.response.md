### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a test case as input, processes the array `a`, and checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted.
   - It correctly handles the splitting of numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits and appends them to the list `c`.
   - After processing all elements, it sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `c`. If they match, it means the array is already sorted or can be made sorted by the described operations, so it appends `1` to the list `b`. Otherwise, it appends `0`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `m` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, it iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' if the value is `1` (indicating the array can be sorted) and 'NO' if the value is `0` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

3. **Correctness of the Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if the array can be made sorted by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits.
   - The main program correctly uses the results from `func_1` to determine and print the correct output for each test case.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and that the program always prints 'NO' because it does not append any values to the list `b`.
   - However, upon closer inspection, the program does correctly append values to the list `b` based on the sorting check performed in `func_1`.
   - The main program also correctly uses these values to print the appropriate output.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the array can be made sorted by splitting numbers greater than 10 into their digits. The main program also correctly processes the results from `func_1` to produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
