### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - The function correctly returns `t` as an integer.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object containing these integers.
   - Since the map object is immediately converted to a list using `list(map(...))`, the function effectively returns a list of integers.
   - This function is used to read `n` and `k` for each test case, and the prices `a` and `b`.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function takes two arguments: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)`, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers.
   - The function calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple is greater than or equal to 0.
   - However, the function logic seems to be flawed because it incorrectly adds the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` to `sub_summ` if their sum is non-negative. This does not align with the problem statement requirements.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly initializes variables and processes each test case.
   - It uses a min-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the highest `k` values of `b_i`.
   - It iteratively processes the items and updates the `sub_sum` variable based on whether the item is taken for free or sold to Bob.
   - The logic for updating `sub_sum` and `max_value` appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

### Issue with Function 3:
- The function `func_3` is not correctly implemented. It should calculate the sum of `b_i` values where `a_i + b_i >= 0` but instead calculates the sum of `a_i` values under certain conditions. This misalignment with the problem statement leads to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The main program logic is mostly correct, but the implementation of `func_3` is flawed. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is **False**.

### Correctness:
**False**
