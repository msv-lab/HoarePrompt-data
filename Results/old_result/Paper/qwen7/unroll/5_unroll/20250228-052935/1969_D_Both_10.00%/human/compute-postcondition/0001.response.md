Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for val_a in sec_arr:`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `val_a` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `main_ar` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i).
   - `sec_arr` is a list of integers.
   - `sub_summ` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `sec_arr`.
   - The variable `val_a` will take the value of each element in `sec_arr` during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on `sec_arr`, we need to ensure that `sec_arr` has at least one element.
   - The initial value of `val_a` will be the first element of `sec_arr`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `sec_arr` must have at least one element, and `val_a` will be set to the first element of `sec_arr`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i), `sec_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `sub_summ` is 0, and `val_a` is the first element of `sec_arr`**.
