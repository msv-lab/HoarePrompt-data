Output State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i); `sec_arr` is a list of integers; `sub_summ` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sub_summ` to 0. This does not affect the values of `main_ar` or `sec_arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, while `sub_summ` is explicitly set to 0.
