Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for val_b in main_ar:`. The variables involved here are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `main_ar` is not empty. Each iteration of the loop assigns the next tuple from `main_ar` to `val_b`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as:
   - `main_ar` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)`.
   - `sec_arr` is a list of integers.
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one tuple. The values of `val_b` and `sec_arr` and `sub_summ` do not affect the loop's ability to start.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `main_ar` to ensure it contains at least one tuple.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`main_ar` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, `sec_arr` is a list of integers, `sub_summ` is the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `sec_arr`**.
