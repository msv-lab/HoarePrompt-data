Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions inside the loop. For each iteration of the loop, if the conditions `match_a_b` and `not match_c` are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The specific sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
