Reasoning:

1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template based on the characters in `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character from `a` to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a` to the template.
4. It then checks if both `a` and `b` match the template. This is done by ensuring that for each position, if the template character is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must match it. If the template character is uppercase, neither `a` nor `b` should match its lowercase version.
5. It also checks if `c` does not match the template. This is done similarly to the previous check, but ensuring that `c` does not match the template.
6. If both conditions are met (`a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not), it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct and aligns with the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
