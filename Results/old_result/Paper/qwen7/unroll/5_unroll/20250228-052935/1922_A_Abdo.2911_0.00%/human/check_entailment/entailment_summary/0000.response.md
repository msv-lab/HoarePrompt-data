Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template string by comparing characters in `a` and `b`. If the characters are the same, it appends the character as is; otherwise, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a`.
4. It then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template. This is done by ensuring that if the template character is lowercase, both `a` and `b` must match it; if the template character is uppercase, neither `a` nor `b` should match its lowercase version.
5. It also checks if `c` does not match the template, ensuring that if the template character is lowercase, `c` must not match it; if the template character is uppercase, `c` must not match its lowercase version.
6. Based on these checks, it prints 'YES' if the conditions are met and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
