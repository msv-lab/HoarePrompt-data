Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives three parameters: t, n, and k, where t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

However, since the function definition itself does not specify any parameters and only describes the constraints and expected behavior, the direct return value cannot be specified without additional context. Based on the given constraints, the function seems to process the values of n and k within certain ranges and might return a specific value or set of values depending on their relationship, but the exact nature of the return value is not detailed here.
