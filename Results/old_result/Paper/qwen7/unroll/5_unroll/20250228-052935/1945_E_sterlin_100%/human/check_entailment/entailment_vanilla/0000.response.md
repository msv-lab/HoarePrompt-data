Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to rearrange a permutation `p` of size `n` such that after performing binary search, `p[l]` equals `x`.
   - We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.
   - The binary search algorithm is supposed to find `x` in the permutation.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `m = ⌊(r + l) / 2⌋`.
   - Depending on whether `p[m] <= x`, it updates either `l` or `r`.

3. **Rearrangement Strategy**:
   - The goal is to place `x` at the position `l` after the binary search.
   - We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

4. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads input and processes each test case.
   - It defines helper functions for reading input (though these are not used in the main logic).
   - There is no actual implementation of the solution logic.

### Main Logic Missing:
- The program does not contain the logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps.
- The binary search itself is not implemented.
- There is no code that performs the necessary swaps to ensure `p[l] == x`.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not contain the required logic to solve the problem, it cannot be considered correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
