Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function correctly reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - **func_2()**: This function should read and return `n` and `x` for a single test case. However, the current implementation returns a map object, which is not appropriate for returning two integers. It should directly return a tuple `(n, x)`.
   - **func_3()**: This function correctly reads and returns the permutation `p` as a list of integers.
   - **func_4()**: This function is not defined in the provided code, but based on the context, it seems to be intended to read the entire input for a single test case including `t`, `n`, `x`, and `p`.
   - **func_5()**: This function is also not defined in the provided code, but it seems to be intended to process the input for a single test case, similar to `func_4()`.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program attempts to find the position of `x` in the permutation `p` using a modified binary search approach.
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position (`left`).
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position by finding the first missing index in the `seen` array and swapping it with `x`.
   - The program ensures that no more than 2 swaps are made, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The main logic of the program is correct and follows the problem statement.
   - The issue lies in the function definitions. `func_2()` and `func_4()`/`func_5()` are not correctly implemented and should be fixed to ensure they return the correct types of data.

Given the above analysis, the main logic of the program is correct, but the function definitions need to be fixed. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is **False** due to the incorrect function implementations.

Correctness: **False**
