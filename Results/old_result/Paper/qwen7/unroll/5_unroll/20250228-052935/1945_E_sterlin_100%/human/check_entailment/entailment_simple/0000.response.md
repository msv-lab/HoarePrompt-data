Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are defined but their implementations are not provided in the annotated program. However, the comments describe what these functions should do, which is consistent with the problem statement. This means that the logic for reading inputs and processing them is correctly described.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The core logic of the program involves performing binary search on the permutation to find the position of `x`. The key part is how the indices are swapped to ensure that `p[left]` equals `x` after the binary search. The program attempts to achieve this by performing at most 2 swaps.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - If `p[left] == x`, no swaps are needed (`print(0)`).
   - If `x` is not seen in the middle of the binary search (`seen[x - 1]` is 0), a single swap is made to bring `x` to the correct position (`print(1)` and `print(left + 1, num_indx[x])`).
   - If `x` is not found directly and needs to be swapped with another element, two swaps are made to ensure `p[left]` equals `x` (`print(2)` and two print statements for the indices to be swapped).

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where `x` might not be in the middle of the permutation and requires adjustments through swaps. The logic for determining the correct indices to swap seems sound based on the problem constraints.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic for determining the correct swaps to make before performing the binary search appears to be correct. The program follows the problem's requirements and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
