Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly parses the input for each test case and initializes necessary variables.
2. It constructs the `ones` and `sum` arrays, which are used to keep track of the cumulative counts of 1s and the modified cumulative sums (each element in `nums` is reduced by 1).
3. For each query, the program calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the modified sum (`sumInRange`) within the specified subarray.
4. The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` checks if flipping at most one 0 to 1 can make the subarray sum non-negative.
5. The logic for determining if a subarray is "good" is sound and matches the problem statement.
6. The program handles all test cases and queries as specified in the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
