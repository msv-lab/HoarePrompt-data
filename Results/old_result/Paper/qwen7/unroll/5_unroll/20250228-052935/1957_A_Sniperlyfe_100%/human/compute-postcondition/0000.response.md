Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `freq` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `freq`. This does not affect the values of the elements in the list `arr`. Therefore, the list `arr` retains its initial state with the first element being the number of sticks available (`n`), and the subsequent elements being the lengths of the sticks. The only new variable introduced is `freq`, which is an empty dictionary.
