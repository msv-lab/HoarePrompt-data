Based on the initial state provided:

- `vals` is a list of integers.
- `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`.
- `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.
- `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)` and is stated to be less than or equal to 0.

The print statement is simply:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `-1` regardless of the values of any other variables.

Output: **-1**
