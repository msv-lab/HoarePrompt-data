Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, the list `k` contains `N` integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `vals`. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged, and the list `k` is unaffected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `vals` along with the unchanged variables `t` and `N`, and the unchanged condition of the list `k`.
