Output State: **`vals` is a list of integers, `prod` is the product of all elements in the list `vals`, and `vprod` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `vals` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`.**

Explanation: The code creates a new list `vprod` where each element is calculated as `prod // r` for each element `r` in the list `vals`. Since `prod` is the product of all elements in `vals`, dividing `prod` by each element `r` in `vals` results in the product of all other elements in `vals`. The initial state of `prod` remains unchanged, and `vprod` is now a list containing these calculated values.
