Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers.
   - It then computes a new list where each element is the product of all multipliers divided by the corresponding multiplier in the original list.
   - The denominator is calculated as the product minus the sum of the new list.
   - If the denominator is less than or equal to zero, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it prints the new list as space-separated integers.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of calculating the product and distributing the coins seems to follow the requirement that the total bet should be less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - However, the calculation of the new list \(vprod\) might not always satisfy the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. Specifically, the approach of dividing the product by each \(k_i\) does not guarantee that the total bet will be less than the winnings for each outcome.
   - For example, consider the test case with \(N = 3\) and multipliers \(3, 2, 7\). The product is \(42\). The new list would be \([14, 21, 6]\). The total bet is \(14 + 21 + 6 = 41\), which is indeed less than the winnings for each outcome. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less for all possible combinations of multipliers.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome in all cases. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
