Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Variable Initialization and Computation**:
   - `N = int(input().strip())`: This line correctly reads the number of outcomes (`n`) for the current test case.
   - `vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]`: This line correctly reads the multipliers (`k_i`) for each outcome and stores them in a list `vals`.

3. **Product Calculation**:
   - `prod = 1`
   - `for r in vals: prod *= r`: This loop correctly calculates the product of all elements in `vals`.

4. **Division and Summation**:
   - `vprod = [(prod // r) for r in vals]`: This list comprehension correctly computes the value of `prod // r` for each element `r` in `vals`.
   - `den = prod - sum(vprod)`: This line correctly calculates the difference between `prod` and the sum of the elements in `vprod`.

5. **Condition Check and Output**:
   - `if (den <= 0) : print(-1)`: This condition checks if `den` is less than or equal to zero. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating that no valid distribution of coins exists.
   - `else: print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))`: If the condition is false, it prints the values in `vprod` separated by spaces, which represents the valid distribution of coins.

6. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `None` after printing the result, which is appropriate since the function does not need to return any value.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases (such as when `den` is non-positive) and produces the correct output format.

Correctness: **True**
