You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `n` lines, each containing either the value of `a * b` or `round(a * d)`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d` or not for each iteration of the loop. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from the input for each iteration, and `d` is calculated as `c / 2`. The comparison between `a * b` and `a * d` determines which value is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates \( d \) as half of \( c \) (where \( c \) is read alongside \( a \) and \( b \)), then compares \( a \times b \) with \( a \times d \). If \( a \times b \) is less than \( a \times d \), it prints \( a \times b \); otherwise, it prints the rounded value of \( a \times d \). After processing all test cases, it outputs \( n \) lines, each containing one of the computed values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the cost when the promotion price for two yogurts (b) is less than half the regular price of one yogurt (a/2). 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 5 11
```
According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to buy three yogurts under the promotion, which costs 15 burles (3 * 11 / 2 = 16.5, rounded down to 15). However, the program checks if `a * b < a * d` where `d = c / 2`, and since `5 * 11 < 5 * 5.5` is false, it prints `5 * 5 = 25`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if buying in pairs (promotion) is cheaper than buying individually and then adjust the total cost accordingly. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate cost without promotion
        cost_without_promotion = n * a
        # Calculate cost with promotion
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_with_promotion = pairs * b + remaining * a
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_without_promotion, cost_with_promotion))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for all potential cases.
