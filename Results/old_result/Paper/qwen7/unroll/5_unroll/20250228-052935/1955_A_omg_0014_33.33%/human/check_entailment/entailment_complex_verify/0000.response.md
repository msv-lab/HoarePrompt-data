### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step using the given annotations and the problem description.

#### Initial Analysis:
1. **Problem Description**: Maxim needs to buy exactly `n` yogurts. The goal is to find the minimum cost considering both the regular price (`a`) and the promotion price (`b`).
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It calculates `d` as `c / 2` (which is `b / 2`).
   - It compares `a * b` with `a * d` and prints the result of the comparison.
3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations suggest that the program should compare the cost of buying individual yogurts (`a * b`) with the cost of buying pairs of yogurts under promotion (`a * d`).

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Incorrect Comparison**:
   - The program incorrectly compares `a * b` with `a * d` instead of comparing the cost of buying pairs of yogurts with the cost of buying individual yogurts.
   - The correct logic should be to compare the cost of buying pairs of yogurts (`b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`) with the cost of buying individual yogurts (`a * n`).

2. **Corrected Version**:
   - The original assessment provided a corrected version of the program:
     ```python
     def func():
         n = int(input())
         for i in range(n):
             (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
             # Calculate cost without promotion
             cost_without_promotion = n * a
             # Calculate cost with promotion
             pairs = n // 2
             remaining = n % 2
             cost_with_promotion = pairs * b + remaining * a
             # Print the minimum of the two costs
             print(min(cost_without_promotion, cost_with_promotion))
     ```
   - This corrected version correctly calculates the cost of buying pairs of yogurts and the cost of buying individual yogurts, then prints the minimum of the two.

3. **Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations indicate that the program should calculate the cost of buying pairs of yogurts (`c / 2` where `c` is `b`) and compare it with the cost of buying individual yogurts (`a`).
   - The corrected version provided in the original assessment matches this logic and ensures the minimum cost is calculated correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases, and the corrected version provided in the assessment is correct.

### Final:
**False**
