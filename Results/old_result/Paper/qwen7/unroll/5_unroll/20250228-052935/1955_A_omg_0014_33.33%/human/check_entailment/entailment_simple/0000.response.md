Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `d` as `c / 2`, but since `c` is not defined in the problem statement, it seems like there's a typo here. The correct calculation should be `d = b / 2` because `b` represents the price for two yogurts.
4. The program then compares `a * b` (the cost of buying each yogurt individually) with `a * d` (the cost of buying two yogurts at the promotion price).
5. If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`. Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

However, the logic to calculate the minimum cost for `n` yogurts is flawed. The program does not account for the optimal way to use the promotion to minimize the total cost. Specifically, it does not consider the scenario where using the promotion for some pairs of yogurts and buying the rest individually might yield a lower cost.

To fix this, we need to calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotion price and how many individual yogurts will be needed. This involves dividing `n` by 2 to get the number of pairs and handling the remainder separately.

Here is the corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the cost without any promotion
        cost_without_promotion = n * a
        
        # Calculate the cost with promotion
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost_with_promotion = pairs * b + remaining * a
        
        # Print the minimum of the two costs
        print(min(cost_without_promotion, cost_with_promotion))
```

Given the above reasoning, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the minimum cost. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
