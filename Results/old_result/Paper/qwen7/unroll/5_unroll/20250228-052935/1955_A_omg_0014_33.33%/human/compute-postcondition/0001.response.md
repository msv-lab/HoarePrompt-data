State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer because `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than 0, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts, as `range(n)` begins counting from 0.
4. The value of `t` (which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop's execution condition and therefore does not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
