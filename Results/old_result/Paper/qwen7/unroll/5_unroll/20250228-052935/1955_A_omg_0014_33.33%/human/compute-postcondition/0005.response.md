Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates \( d \) as half of \( c \) (where \( c \) is read alongside \( a \) and \( b \)), then compares \( a \times b \) with \( a \times d \). If \( a \times b \) is less than \( a \times d \), it prints \( a \times b \); otherwise, it prints the rounded value of \( a \times d \). After processing all test cases, it outputs \( n \) lines, each containing one of the computed values.**
