Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `final` is a list of n elements where each element is the sum of the smallest numbers from pairs of the input lists.
