### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `kreker` times.
3. **Function Call**: Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments but expects two integers `n` and `m` when called inside the loop. This mismatch will cause an error because the function does not accept any arguments.
4. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments (`def func_1():`) but attempts to read `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is incorrect.
5. **Condition Check**: If the condition `n >= m` is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments but is called with two arguments, causing a mismatch. However, the assessment suggested modifying the function definition to accept arguments, which is unnecessary. The function `func_1()` can be called with the arguments directly without needing to redefine it inside the loop.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version directly uses the `n` and `m` variables obtained from the input inside the loop, eliminating the need for the function `func_1()` altogether.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was partially correct in identifying the issue but proposed an unnecessary modification. The program can be simplified by removing the function `func_1()` and directly using the `n` and `m` variables in the loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct after simplifying it by removing the unnecessary function `func_1()`.
