### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `kreker` times.
3. **Function Call**: Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments but expects two integers `n` and `m` when called inside the loop. This mismatch will cause an error because the function does not accept any arguments.
4. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments (`def func_1():`) but attempts to read `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is incorrect.
5. **Condition Check**: If the condition `n >= m` is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the function call and the function definition. The function `func_1()` should indeed accept the parameters `n` and `m`.

However, the original assessment proposed a correction where the function `func_1()` is defined inside the loop, which is unnecessary and would lead to a new scope for `n` and `m` every time the loop runs. Instead, the function should be defined outside the loop and called with the appropriate arguments.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    def func_1(n, m):
        if n >= m:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
    func_1(n, m)
```

### Correctness:
The original assessment suggested a correction that was not necessary and would introduce new issues. The correct approach is to define the function `func_1()` outside the loop and call it with the appropriate arguments.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the mismatch between the function definition and its call. The function `func_1()` should be defined outside the loop and called with the appropriate arguments.
