Output State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` remains unchanged as it is not used in the loop, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each index `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000) contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, the loop prints the sum of digits for each input value from the `values` list `t` times.
