Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it precomputes and stores the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) in an array `values`. This approach is inefficient and does not meet the problem's constraints, especially the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The solution should instead compute the sum of the digits for each number individually when needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    queries = list(map(int, data[1:t+1]))
    
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    
    result = []
    for n in queries:
        total_sum = sum(sum_of_digits(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
        result.append(total_sum)
    
    for r in result:
        print(r)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_1()
```

This corrected version reads all inputs at once, processes each query individually, and calculates the sum of the digits for each number in the range from 1 to \(n\). This approach adheres to the problem constraints and will run efficiently within the given time limits.
