### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `inf` to `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1` which is 200001.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes a list `values` of size `inf` with all elements set to 0.

2. **Precomputation of Digit Sums:**
   - A nested loop is used to precompute the sum of digits for each integer from 1 to `inf - 1`.
   - For each integer `i`, the sum of its digits is calculated and added to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i]`.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, the function reads an integer `value` and prints the corresponding precomputed sum from the `values` list.

4. **Time Complexity Analysis:**
   - Precomputing the digit sums for all integers up to `2 * 10 ** 5` takes \(O(n \log n)\) time because the sum of digits of a number \(i\) can be computed in \(O(\log i)\) time.
   - Querying the precomputed values for each test case takes \(O(1)\) time, making the overall complexity efficient for the given constraints.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach correctly precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers up to `2 * 10 ** 5`.
   - For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed sum efficiently, ensuring correctness.

Given the above analysis, the program is designed to handle the problem efficiently and correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
