Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function does not return any specific value but rather processes these integers according to their constraints.**

However, since the function signature only includes `func_1()` without any parameters, the description should clarify that the function is designed to handle test cases with the given constraints on `t` and `n`, but it does not return any value directly.
