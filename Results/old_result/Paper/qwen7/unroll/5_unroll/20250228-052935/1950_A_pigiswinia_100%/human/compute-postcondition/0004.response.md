Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes three integers a, b, and c within the range 0 to 9, and an integer t within the range 1 to 1000. Based on the value of t, the function returns either a, b, c, or a combination of a, b, and c.**

Note: The actual processing logic based on the value of `t` is not described here as per the instruction to avoid detailing how the function operates.
