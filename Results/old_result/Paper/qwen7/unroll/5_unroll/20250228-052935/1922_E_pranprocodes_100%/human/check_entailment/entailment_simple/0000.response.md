Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation attempts to construct an array based on the parity of `X` and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in the while loop does not ensure that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It simply alternates between appending the maximum and minimum values based on whether `x` is even or odd, which does not correlate with the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **No Guarantee of Correctness**: There is no mathematical or logical basis in the code to ensure that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach taken is heuristic and does not address the core requirement of the problem.

3. **Output Format**: Even if the output format were correct, the content of the array would not necessarily meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
