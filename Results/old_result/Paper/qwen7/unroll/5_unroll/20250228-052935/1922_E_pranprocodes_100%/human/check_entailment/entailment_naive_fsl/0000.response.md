Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by \(X\). Instead, it generates an array using a simple pattern that alternates between the maximum and minimum possible values within a fixed range, which does not guarantee the desired number of increasing subsequences.

For instance, consider the input \(X = 3\). The program will generate an array like \([-1, 100000000, -1, 100000000, -1, 100000000, \ldots]\), which does not necessarily have exactly 3 increasing subsequences. In fact, it will have many more than 3 increasing subsequences due to the repeated values and the alternating pattern.

A correct approach would involve constructing an array where the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\). For example, an array with a specific structure like \([0, 1, 2, \ldots, k-1, 0, 1, \ldots, k-1, \ldots]\) could be used, where the number of increasing subsequences can be controlled by the value of \(k\) and the number of repetitions. However, the given program does not implement such a strategy.
