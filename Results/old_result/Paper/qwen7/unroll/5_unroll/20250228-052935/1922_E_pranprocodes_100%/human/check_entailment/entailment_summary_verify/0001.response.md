### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to construct such an array using a binary-like approach where each bit position corresponds to an element in the array.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm initializes `max` and `min` values to represent the upper and lower bounds of the array elements.
   - It uses a while loop to reduce `x` to 1, appending either `max` or `min` to the `ans` list based on whether `x` is even or odd.
   - If `x` is even, it appends `max` and decrements `max`. If `x` is odd, it appends `min` and increments `min`.
   - After reducing `x` to 1, the `ans` list is reversed and printed along with its length.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `X = 2`, the output should be `[0]` because the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (itself).
   - For other values of `X`, the algorithm constructs an array where each bit position represents an element, ensuring the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the construction of the array for various values of `X` within the specified constraints.
   - However, the provided solution does not actually ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. Instead, it constructs an array based on the binary representation of `X`, which does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct, printing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The binary representation of `X` does not necessarily yield an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, consider `X = 5`. The binary representation is `101`, which would produce the array `[100000000, -100000000, 100000000]`. This array does not have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
