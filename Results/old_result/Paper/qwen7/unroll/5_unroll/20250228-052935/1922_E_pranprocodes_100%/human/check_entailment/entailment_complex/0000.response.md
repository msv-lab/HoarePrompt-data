Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires finding an array of integers such that it has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. However, the function provided attempts to reduce \(X\) to 1 using specific operations and constructs an array based on these operations. This approach does not address the requirement of having exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences in the array.

To solve the problem correctly, one would need to consider how to construct an array that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences. A common strategy is to use powers of 2 because the number of increasing subsequences in an array constructed from distinct powers of 2 can be precisely controlled. For example, an array like `[2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^{k-1}]` has exactly \(2^k - 1\) increasing subsequences.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function provided does not align with the requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
