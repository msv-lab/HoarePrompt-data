Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it takes an integer \(x\) and determines the number of steps required to reduce \(x\) to 1 by either halving \(x\) when it is even or decrementing \(x\) by 1 when it is odd. It also generates a list of integers representing the maximum value (starting from 100000000) for each even step and the minimum value (starting from -100000000) for each odd step, with the list reversed at the end. The function outputs the number of steps and the generated list for each test case.**
