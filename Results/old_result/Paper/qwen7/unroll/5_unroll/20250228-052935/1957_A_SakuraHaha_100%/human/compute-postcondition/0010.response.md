Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.
- `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
- `ans` is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 3.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 3.

To determine the exact value of `ans`, we would need the specific list `a` and the counts stored in `cnt`. However, since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can only describe `ans` in terms of the counts in `cnt`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 3)**
