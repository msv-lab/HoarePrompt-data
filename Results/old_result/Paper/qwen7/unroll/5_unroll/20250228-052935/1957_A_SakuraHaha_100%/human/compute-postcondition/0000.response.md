Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is an integer between 1 and 100. The value of `n` is set to the integer input provided by the user, and it also falls within the range of 1 to 100 as per the precondition.
