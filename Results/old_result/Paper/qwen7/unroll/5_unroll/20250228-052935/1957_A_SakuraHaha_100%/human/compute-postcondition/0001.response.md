Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer, storing the resulting list in `a`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
