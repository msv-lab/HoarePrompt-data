You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20

    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, an integer n, a sorted list of n integers, and an integer m representing the number of queries. For each test case, it calculates the minimum difference count between adjacent elements in the list and stores these counts in two dictionaries, d1 and d2. It then handles m queries, each specifying a range [start, end], and prints the minimum value between the sums calculated from d1 and d2 for each query.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city and calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities. Here are a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Closest City Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the closest city using a sliding window approach, but it does not correctly identify the unique closest city for each city as described in the problem statement. The logic inside the loops does not ensure that the closest city is found uniquely for each city.

2. **Incorrect Distance Calculation**: The program calculates distances and accumulates values in `d1` and `d2` dictionaries, but these calculations do not reflect the actual closest city distances as required. The variables `s1` and `s2` are used to accumulate distances without properly accounting for the closest city logic.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem statement:
- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- The closest city to city 1 is city 2, to city 2 is city 3, to city 3 is city 4, to city 4 is city 3, and to city 5 is city 4.

The program fails to correctly identify these closest cities and calculate the minimum number of coins required for travel. For instance, the distance from city 1 to city 4 should be calculated as follows:
- Travel from city 1 to city 2 (1 coin).
- Travel from city 2 to city 3 (1 coin).
- Travel from city 3 to city 4 (1 coin).

The total cost is 3 coins, but the program does not correctly compute this.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
