Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is set to the integer value entered by the user. The variables d1 and d2 are dictionaries initialized with default integer values. For each test case, there is a list of integers (lst) and two dictionaries (d1 and d2) updated based on the minimum differences between adjacent elements. After processing the list, multiple queries (m) are made, each specifying a range [start, end], for which the minimum value between the sums calculated from d1 and d2 is printed for each query.
