The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t, an integer n, a sorted list of n integers, and an integer m representing the number of queries. For each test case, it calculates the minimum difference count between adjacent elements in the list and stores these counts in two dictionaries, d1 and d2. It then handles m queries, each specifying a range [start, end], and prints the minimum value between the sums calculated from d1 and d2 for each query.
