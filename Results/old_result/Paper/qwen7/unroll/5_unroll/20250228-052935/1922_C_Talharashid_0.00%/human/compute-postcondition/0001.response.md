Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.
   - `i` is the loop counter.
   - `t` is the upper limit of the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop `for i in range(t)` to execute, `t` must be a positive integer greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` is typically set to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is the upper limit and must be a positive integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` should be 0.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is valid and `i` is set to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `i` is 0**.
