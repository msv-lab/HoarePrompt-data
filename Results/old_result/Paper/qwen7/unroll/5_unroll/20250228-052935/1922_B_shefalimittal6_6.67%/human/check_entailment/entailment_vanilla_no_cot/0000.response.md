Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but has several issues:

1. **Triangle Inequality Check**: The program does not check if the selected three sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. However, the current implementation does not include this check.

2. **Combination Calculation**: The code calculates combinations without ensuring the triangle inequality condition is met. For instance, it calculates combinations of sticks even if they do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

3. **Incorrect Combinations Counting**: The logic for counting combinations where at least two sticks are the same is flawed. It incorrectly multiplies the combination counts without considering the triangle inequality.

To fix these issues, the solution should:
- Include a check for the triangle inequality.
- Correctly count valid combinations while ensuring the triangle inequality holds.

Here's an improved version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num_of_lens = {}
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                for k in range(j+1, n):
                    a, b, c = nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]
                    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                        res += 1
        print(res)
```

This version directly checks all possible triplets of sticks and ensures they satisfy the triangle inequality, which correctly counts the number of valid triangles.
