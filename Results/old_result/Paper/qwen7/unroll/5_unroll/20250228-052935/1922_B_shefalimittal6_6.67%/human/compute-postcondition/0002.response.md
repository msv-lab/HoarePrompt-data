Output State: The output state will consist of `t` integers, where each integer represents the value of `res` calculated for each input set `nums`. For each input set `nums`, `res` is computed based on the frequency of each number in the set, using combinations to count the number of ways to pick 3 or 2 numbers from each frequency group.
