Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list of non-negative integers a (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the given values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It processes these inputs without needing them as function parameters and provides output based on the given constraints and data.
