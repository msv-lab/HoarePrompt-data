You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for x in nums:
            num_of_lens[x] = num_of_lens.get(x, 0) + 1
        
        res = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += math.comb(cnt, 3)
            if cnt >= 2:
                total_sum = sum(i for i in num_of_lens.values() if i != cnt)
                res += math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers representing the value of `res` after each iteration of the loop, printed for each input integer `t`. Each `res` is calculated based on the frequency of numbers in the input list `nums`, using combinations to count the number of ways to select specific counts of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list of non-negative integers a (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the given values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
