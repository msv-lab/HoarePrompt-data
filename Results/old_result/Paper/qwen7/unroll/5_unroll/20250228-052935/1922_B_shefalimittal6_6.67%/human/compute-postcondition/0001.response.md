State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Since no other variables or states are involved in the loop head, only `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
