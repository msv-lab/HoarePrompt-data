### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using exactly 3 sticks. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic that needs to be addressed.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length, which is correct.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of ways to form a triangle by considering two scenarios:
     - Choosing 3 sticks of the same length (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`).
     - Choosing 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`), where `total_sum` is the sum of counts of all other lengths.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from both calculations are summed up and printed for each test case.

#### Issues in the Logic

- **Triangle Inequality**: The program does not check if the selected sticks can actually form a non-degenerate triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, for three lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a triangle, the following must hold:
  \[
  a + b > c, \quad a + c > b, \quad b + c > a
  \]
  However, the program only checks the counts and does not verify these conditions.

- **Example Analysis**:
  - **Test Case 1**: The program correctly outputs 35 because all sticks have the same length.
  - **Test Case 2**: The program outputs 2, but this is incorrect. The valid combinations should be checked against the triangle inequality. The sticks with lengths 3, 2, and 3 can form a triangle, but the sticks with lengths 3, 1, and 3 cannot.
  - **Test Case 3**: The program correctly outputs 0 because no combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle.
  - **Test Case 4**: The program correctly outputs 0 because only one stick is given.

### Corrected Approach

To ensure the program correctly forms a non-degenerate triangle, we need to:
1. Sort the stick lengths.
2. Check the triangle inequality for each combination of 3 sticks.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        for combo in combinations(nums, 3):
            if combo[0] + combo[1] > combo[2] and combo[0] + combo[2] > combo[1] and combo[1] + combo[2] > combo[0]:
                res += 1
        print(res)

func()
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was **inaccurate** because it did not account for the triangle inequality condition, which is essential for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

### Final Answer

Final: **False**
