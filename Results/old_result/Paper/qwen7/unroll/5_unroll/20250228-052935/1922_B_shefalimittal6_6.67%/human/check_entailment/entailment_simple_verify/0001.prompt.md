You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers representing the value of `res` after each iteration of the loop, printed for each input integer `t`. Each `res` is calculated based on the frequency of numbers in the input list `nums`, using combinations to count the number of ways to select specific counts of numbers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their corresponding lengths stored in `a_i`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count how many times each length appears.
   - This is done by iterating through the list of stick lengths and updating the counts.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`), where `total_sum` is the sum of counts of all other lengths.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from both calculations are summed up and printed for each test case.

### Detailed Check

#### Case 1: All Sticks Have the Same Length
- If all sticks have the same length, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using combinations.

#### Case 2: Multiple Different Lengths
- For different lengths, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length.

#### Case 3: Edge Cases
- The program handles the edge case where there are fewer than 2 sticks of the same length correctly by not including those in the calculation.

### Example Analysis

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `35`
   - Explanation: Any combination of 3 sticks out of 7 can form a triangle since they all have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 out of 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4 3 2 1 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 1 2 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle because the lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick is given, so no combination of 3 sticks is possible.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using exactly 3 sticks. It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.
