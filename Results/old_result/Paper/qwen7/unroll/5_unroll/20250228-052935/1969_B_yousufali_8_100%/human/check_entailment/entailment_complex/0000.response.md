Reasoning:
1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring chosen for the shift.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function processes a single binary string `s`. It counts the number of '0's that are immediately followed by at least one '1'. However, this function does not account for the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts. Instead, it simply counts occurrences of '0' following '1', which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes multiple test cases. It calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, even though `func_2` loops through all test cases, it still uses an incorrect method to compute the result.

Given that both functions do not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
