Output State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is a list generated by the function `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value `-1` to the variable `pos`. No other changes are made to the variables `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
