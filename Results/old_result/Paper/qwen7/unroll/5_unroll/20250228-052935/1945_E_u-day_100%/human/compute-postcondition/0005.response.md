Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n` respectively. The value of `pos` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`. The value of `n` is assumed to be the length of the list `arr`.
