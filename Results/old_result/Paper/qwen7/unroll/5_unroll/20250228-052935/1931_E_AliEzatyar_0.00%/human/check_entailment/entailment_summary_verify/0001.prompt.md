You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the count of trailing zeros (i.e., '0' characters) at the end of the list. If the list does not contain any '0' characters at the end, it returns 0.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - It iterates over each test case and reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the list of integers and splits them into individual strings.
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - It calls `func_1` on each string to count the number of trailing zeros.
   - It sorts the counts of trailing zeros in descending order.
   - It processes the sorted list of zeros in pairs and sums them up in `subtract_zero`.

3. **Winning Condition Check:**
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If true, it sets the answer to 'Sasha'.
   - Otherwise, it sets the answer to 'Anna'.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the answers for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis of the Logic

1. **Trailing Zeros Counting:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer.
   - This is used to identify numbers that can be easily manipulated by Anna to reduce the overall digit count.

2. **Game Strategy:**
   - The key idea is to check if the remaining digits after Anna's optimal moves (reversing numbers) and Sasha's optimal moves (concatenating numbers) can form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - The logic of processing zeros in pairs and checking the difference in digit counts is a simplified version of the game strategy but might not fully capture all optimal moves.

### Issues in the Implementation

1. **Incorrect Handling of Game Moves:**
   - The program assumes that Sasha and Anna play optimally, but the logic provided does not fully simulate the game rules.
   - Specifically, it does not account for the fact that Sasha can always concatenate two numbers, reducing the list size by one, while Anna can only reverse one number per turn.
   - The current logic does not simulate the actual game turns and outcomes accurately.

2. **Simplified Winning Condition:**
   - The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is overly simplistic and may not correctly determine the winner in all scenarios.
   - It does not consider the dynamic nature of the game where Sasha can always reduce the list size by concatenating numbers.

### Conclusion

Given the issues with the logic and the simplified approach, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement.
