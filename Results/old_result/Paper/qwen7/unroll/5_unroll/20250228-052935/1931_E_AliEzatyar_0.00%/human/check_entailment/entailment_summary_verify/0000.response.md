### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it against the game rules and the optimal strategies for both players.

#### Key Issues in the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**:
   - The program splits the input string and calculates the length of each split part. This is incorrect because it does not handle the actual integer values properly. The program should consider the reversed digit counts of the integers directly.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Zeros**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in the reversed form of each number. However, the program incorrectly uses this information to determine the winner without considering the actual game mechanics.

3. **Logic Flaws**:
   - The program attempts to determine the winner based on the difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero`, but this does not align with the game rules. The game involves strategic moves of reversing digits and concatenating numbers, which are not accurately reflected in the current logic.

4. **Missing Game Strategy**:
   - The program lacks the necessary logic to simulate the game and determine the optimal moves for both players. It does not consider the possibility of Sasha winning if he can concatenate numbers to form a number greater than \(10^m\).

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly implement the game logic, we need to simulate the game and consider the following points:

1. **Game Rules**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen numbers.
   - The game ends when Sasha can no longer make a move, and the remaining number is checked against \(10^m\).

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Anna aims to prevent Sasha from forming a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - Sasha aims to form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\) by concatenating numbers.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If the maximum number in the list is already greater than or equal to \(10^m\), Sasha wins immediately.
   - If the sum of the lengths of the numbers (after reversing) is greater than or equal to \(m+1\), Sasha can always form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

#### Revised Program:

Based on the above observations, the correct approach would involve checking if the maximum number in the list is already greater than or equal to \(10^m\). If not, check if the sum of the lengths of the numbers (after reversing) is greater than or equal to \(m+1\).

Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test

for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Check if any number is already greater than or equal to 10^m
    if max(array) >= 10**m:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        # Calculate the sum of the lengths of the numbers after reversing
        total_length = sum(len(str(num)) for num in array)
        if total_length >= m + 1:
            answers[test] = 'Sasha'
        else:
            answers[test] = 'Anna'

for answer in answers:
    print(answer)
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the winner of the game. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
