Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It also accepts a parameter `d`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `d` contains an integer index. The function returns a string consisting of characters from `s` at positions specified by the first element of each tuple in `d`, ordered by the ascending balance values of parentheses up to those positions.**
