Reasoning:

1. The program reads a balanced parentheses sequence from the input.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that should perform the balanced shuffle operation.
3. Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `d` is used to store the prefix balances at each position.
4. The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`.
5. The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the dictionary `d` with the prefix balance at each position.
6. After populating the dictionary, the program removes the entry corresponding to the length of the string (`d.pop(n)`).
7. The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the prefix balance values, breaking ties by position in descending order.
8. Finally, the program constructs the shuffled sequence by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions and returns the result.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- The dictionary `d` is indexed by `i + 1`, but the keys should be integers starting from 1, which might cause confusion. It would be clearer to use `range(1, n+1)`.
- The sorting step does not correctly handle the tie-breaking rule for positions in descending order. The current implementation sorts by the balance value, but it should also consider the position in descending order when the balance values are equal.
- The program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

To fix these issues, the program should:

1. Use a list instead of a dictionary to store the prefix balances.
2. Sort the list of tuples containing the position and balance, ensuring that ties are broken by position in descending order.
3. Construct the result string using the sorted positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = [(0, 0)]  # Initialize with (balance, position)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d.append((d[-1][0] + 1, i + 1))
        else:
            d.append((d[-1][0] - 1, i + 1))
    d.pop()  # Remove the last element, which is not needed
    d = sorted(d, key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))  # Sort by balance, then by position in descending order
    for (_, pos) in d:
        ans += s[pos - 1]  # Adjust index to match original string
    return ans
```

Given the corrections, the original program is incorrect. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
