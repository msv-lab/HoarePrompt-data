Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `i` and `len(s)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` will start from 0 (as per the `range(len(s))`).
   - `len(s)` is the length of the string `s`, which is already known as `n`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(s)`.
   - Initially, `i` is 0 and `len(s)` is `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `len(s)` should be set to `n`.

5. **Consider other variables**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")".
   - `n` is the length of `s`.
   - `ans` is an empty string.
   - `d[0]` is 0.

Since the loop execution depends only on `i` and `len(s)`, we need to ensure these variables are correctly initialized.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(s)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(s)` is `n`**
