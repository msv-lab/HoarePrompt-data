#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and s is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list where each element `d[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) represents the balance of parentheses up to position `i` in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a string consisting of all characters from `s` at positions specified by the first element of each tuple in `d`. The positions are in ascending order based on the balance values of parentheses up to that position.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters from 's' at positions specified by the first element of each tuple in 'd', ordered by the ascending balance values of parentheses up to those positions.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and forms a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It calculates the balance of parentheses up to each position in `s`, sorts these positions based on their balance values, and then constructs and returns a new string containing characters from `s` at the sorted positions.
