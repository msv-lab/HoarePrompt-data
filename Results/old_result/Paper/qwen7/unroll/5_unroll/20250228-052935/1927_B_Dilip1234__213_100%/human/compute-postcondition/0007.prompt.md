You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the i-th index in the string.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `char_count` is a list of 26 integers where each integer is equal to the number of times its corresponding character ('a' to 'z') appears in the string `s`. The string `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in the list `a`, and `n` is the length of the string `s`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` that contains characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in the list `char_count`, where each integer in `char_count` represents the number of times its corresponding character appears in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the `i`-th index in the string. The function returns a string `s` that contains characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in the list `char_count`, where each integer in `char_count` represents the number of times its corresponding character appears in `s`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a string `s` that contains characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in the list `char_count`, where each integer in `char_count` represents the number of times its corresponding character appears in `s`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
