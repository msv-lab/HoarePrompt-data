Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state, but it will start from 0 in the first iteration of the loop.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer representing the length of the string `s`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n` (the length of the string `s`).

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute as long as `i < n`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 initially and `n` is a positive integer.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**.
