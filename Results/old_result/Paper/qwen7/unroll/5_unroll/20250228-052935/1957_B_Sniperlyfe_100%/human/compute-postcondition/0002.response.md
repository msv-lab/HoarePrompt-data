Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of n zeros; `nums[0]` is (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1; `k` is decreased by `nums[0]`.**

Explanation: The variable `k` is decremented by the value of `nums[0]`, which is `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
