Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations.
2. The provided solution checks if the first and last rows are identical and filled with the same character, or if they are different but have uniform characters across them. If either condition is met, it concludes that it's impossible to make all squares the same color and prints 'NO'.
3. However, this approach is flawed because it doesn't fully capture the potential for making all squares the same color through other configurations. For instance, it fails to consider grids where the entire grid is uniform except for a few cells that don't form a rectangle with the same color.
4. The execution summary mentions that the function should check if the first and last rows are identical and filled with the same character, or if they are different but have uniform characters across them. This is not sufficient to determine if all squares can be made the same color.

Given the flaws in the logic, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
