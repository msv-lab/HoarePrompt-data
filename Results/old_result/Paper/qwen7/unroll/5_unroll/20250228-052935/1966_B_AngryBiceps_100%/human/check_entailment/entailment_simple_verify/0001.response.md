### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program:

1. **Incorrect Condition Checking:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that if the first and last rows or columns are not the same but have all elements the same color, it is impossible to make all squares the same color. This is not necessarily true because the problem allows operations that can change multiple squares at once within a subrectangle. Simply having different first and last rows/columns with the same color does not preclude making all squares the same color.

2. **Lack of General Solution:**
   - The program does not provide a general solution to check if it is possible to make all squares the same color. It only checks specific edge cases and fails to handle more complex scenarios.

However, the original assessment concludes that the program is incorrect without providing a counterexample or a more detailed explanation of why the program fails in certain cases. Let's provide a more detailed analysis and a counterexample to support this conclusion.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Counterexample

Consider the following grid:
```
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
WBWB
```

- **First Row:** `BWBW`
- **Last Row:** `WBWB`

- **First Column:** `BWBW`
- **Last Column:** `WBWB`

- **First and Last Rows:** Both are different but have the same pattern.
- **First and Last Columns:** Both are different but have the same pattern.

According to the program, since the first and last rows and columns are different but have the same pattern, it would print "NO". However, we can perform the following operations to make all squares the same color:

1. Select positions `(1, 1)` and `(2, 2)` to color the subrectangle from `(1, 1)` to `(2, 2)` to white.
2. Select positions `(3, 1)` and `(4, 2)` to color the subrectangle from `(3, 1)` to `(4, 2)` to white.
3. Select positions `(1, 3)` and `(2, 4)` to color the subrectangle from `(1, 3)` to `(2, 4)` to white.
4. Select positions `(3, 3)` and `(4, 4)` to color the subrectangle from `(3, 3)` to `(4, 4)` to white.

After these operations, all squares will be white, so the program should print "YES".

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares the same color in certain cases. The provided counterexample demonstrates that the program incorrectly prints "NO" when it should print "YES".

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
