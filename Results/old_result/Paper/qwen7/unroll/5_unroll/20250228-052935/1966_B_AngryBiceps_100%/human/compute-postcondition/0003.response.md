Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m, where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also receives a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns information about the grid based on certain conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a grid of specified dimensions filled with 'W' and 'B', and a count of how many such grids to process. However, since the function definition itself does not include any parameters, the description focuses on what the function is expected to do given the constraints and the nature of the input data.
