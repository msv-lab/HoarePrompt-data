Output State: **`a` is a 2D list representing the field, `b` is an integer representing the number of steps in the game, `x` is the first element of the first sublist in `a`, and `y` is the second element of the first sublist in `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = a` unpacks the first sublist of the 2D list `a` into the variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` is a 2D list where each element is a string of length 2, `x` will be the first character of the first sublist, and `y` will be the second character of the first sublist. The rest of the 2D list `a` and the integer `b` remain unchanged.
