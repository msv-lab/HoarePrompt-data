Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field dimensions, players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle. It also sets up dictionaries and lists to track player movements and game state.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to identify players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle. It also correctly identifies the middle of the field.

3. **Movement Function**: The `func_1` function correctly updates the position of a player based on the direction of movement. This function is used correctly within the main loop.

4. **Game Logic**:
   - **Player Movements**: The program correctly handles player movements, ensuring that players do not move out of bounds and that they do not catch a ball unless they are in the same cell as the ball.
   - **Ball Handling**: The program correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle. When a player catches the Quaffle, it updates the Quaffle's position to the player's current position. When a player throws the Quaffle, it updates the Quaffle's position to an empty string, indicating that the Quaffle is no longer being carried.
   - **Scoring**: The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message. It also correctly updates the score and moves the Quaffle to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.
   - **Elimination**: The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated due to a Bludger and prints the appropriate message. It also correctly handles the elimination of multiple players at the same time.

5. **Output**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
