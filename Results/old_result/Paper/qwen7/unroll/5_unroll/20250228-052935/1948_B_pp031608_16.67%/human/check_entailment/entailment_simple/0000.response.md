Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not handle the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10 into their constituent digits and inserting them back into the list.
2. The `func_1` function checks if the list is sorted but does not perform any operations to sort the list according to the problem's requirements.
3. The main loop iterates through the list and checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10. If so, it attempts to split the previous element into its digits and reinsert them. However, this approach is flawed because:
   - It only performs one split operation per iteration, which may not be sufficient to sort the entire list.
   - It does not ensure that the list is sorted after performing the split operation.
4. The program should repeatedly attempt to split elements that are at least 10 until the list is sorted or it determines that sorting is impossible.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
