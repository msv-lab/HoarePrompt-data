Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where an element is greater than 10 and needs to be split into its constituent digits. Instead, the program checks if the array is already sorted after performing the operations, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

The program should transform the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` into `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` by splitting `12`, `45`, and `67`. However, the program does not perform these splits correctly. It simply checks if the array is sorted after the operations, which it is not doing in the intended manner.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly split the elements that are greater than 10 and insert their digits back into the array. The current implementation does not achieve this.
