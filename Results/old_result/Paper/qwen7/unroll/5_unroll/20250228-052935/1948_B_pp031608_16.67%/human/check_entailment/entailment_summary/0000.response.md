Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The main issue lies in the loop that attempts to sort the array by breaking down elements into their constituent digits. This loop does not actually perform the operations as described in the problem statement. Instead, it calls `func_1` after each iteration, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The program tries to break down elements greater than 10 into their constituent digits and insert them back into the list. However, the implementation of this logic is missing. There is no code that performs the actual digit splitting and reinsertion.

2. **Unnecessary `func_1` Call**: The `func_1` function is called within the loop, but it does not help in achieving the goal of making the array sorted. Instead, it checks if the array is already sorted, which is not useful in this context.

3. **Logic Flow**: The program should iterate through the array and, for each element greater than 10, split it into digits and insert those digits back into the list. It should then check if the array is sorted after performing these operations.

Given these issues, the program cannot correctly determine if it is possible to make the array sorted using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you would need to implement the logic for splitting elements and inserting the digits back into the list, and then check if the resulting array is sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Perform the operations to split elements into digits
    for p in range(len(list1) - 1, -1, -1):
        if list1[p] >= 10:
            a = list1[p]
            list1.pop(p)
            list1.insert(p, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p + 1, a % 10)
    
    # Check if the array is sorted
    if list1 == sorted(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version iterates through the list from the end to the beginning, ensuring that larger numbers are processed first. It splits the numbers into digits and inserts them back into the list. Finally, it checks if the resulting list is sorted.
