### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements**: The program only splits elements if the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10. This logic is incomplete because it does not consider all possible operations (i.e., splitting any element that is at least 10, regardless of its position relative to other elements).

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**: The program does not guarantee termination. If the array cannot be sorted through the allowed operations, it may enter an infinite loop due to repeated calls to `func_1` without making progress.

3. **Missing Handling of Digits Greater Than 10**: The program only considers splitting elements into their digits if they are at least 10. However, the problem statement allows splitting any element that is at least 10, regardless of its position.

4. **Output Format**: The output should be "YES" or "NO" in uppercase or lowercase. The program prints "Yes" or "No", which is acceptable but not strictly correct according to the problem statement.

These issues indicate that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect based on the detailed analysis and the issues identified.
