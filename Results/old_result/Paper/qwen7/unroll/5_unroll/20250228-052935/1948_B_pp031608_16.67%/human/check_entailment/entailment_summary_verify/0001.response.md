### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given Python program based on the problem description, the provided function summary, and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to determine if it is possible to sort an array by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting those digits back into the array.

#### Given Code Recap
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

#### Function Summary Recap
- `func_1` checks if the input list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment
1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Elements:**
   - The program only splits elements if they are at least 10 and are greater than the next element. This is incomplete and does not cover all possible operations.
   
2. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - The program does not ensure that the array will eventually be sorted, leading to potential infinite loops.

3. **Missing Handling of Digits Greater Than 10:**
   - The program only handles splitting elements that are at least 10, but the problem allows splitting any element that is at least 10.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is acceptable but not strictly correct as per the problem statement.

#### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Splitting Logic:**
   - The current implementation only splits elements under specific conditions. It should split any element that is at least 10, regardless of its position relative to the next element.
   - The program should attempt to split every element that is at least 10 and see if it helps in sorting the array.

2. **Sorting Check:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted. However, the main loop should continue attempting to split elements until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.

3. **Potential Infinite Loops:**
   - The current logic does not guarantee termination. If the array cannot be sorted through the allowed operations, the program may enter an infinite loop.

4. **Handling All Possible Operations:**
   - The program should attempt to split any element that is at least 10 and check if the array becomes sorted. This requires a more comprehensive approach to handling all possible operations.

#### Corrected Approach
- The program should attempt to split every element that is at least 10 and check if the array becomes sorted after each split.
- The main loop should continue until the array is sorted or it is determined that sorting is impossible.

#### Final Evaluation
Based on the detailed analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It lacks the necessary logic to handle all possible operations and does not guarantee termination.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
