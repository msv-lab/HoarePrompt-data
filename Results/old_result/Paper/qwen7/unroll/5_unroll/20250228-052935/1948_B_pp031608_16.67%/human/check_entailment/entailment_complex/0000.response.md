Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The key issue lies in the logic used to modify the list `list1`. The code attempts to check if the list is already sorted and then tries to sort it if it is not. However, the approach to modifying the list by splitting elements into their digits and reinserting them is not implemented. Instead, the code simply checks if the list is sorted without performing the necessary operations to transform it.

Hereâ€™s why the given program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The program does not perform the digit-splitting operation as required. It only checks if the list is sorted and prints "Yes" or "No" based on that check.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The loop that should perform the digit-splitting operation is missing. The code snippet provided does not contain any logic to split elements that are greater than or equal to 10 and insert their digits back into the list.

3. **Function `func_1`**: While the function `func_1` correctly checks if a list is sorted, it does not help in solving the problem because the main logic to transform the list is missing.

Given these points, the program does not fulfill the requirement of transforming the list using the specified operations to make it sorted.

Correctness: **False**
