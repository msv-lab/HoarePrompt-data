Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated for each string `s` read from input during the loop iterations. For each iteration, if the count of '1' in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count of '1' is greater than 2 but not even, or if the count of '1' is 1, or if '11' appears in the string `s`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' will depend on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.
