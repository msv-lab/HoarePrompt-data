Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated for each string `s` read from input during the loop iterations. Specifically, for each iteration, if the count of '1's in the string `s` is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and odd, or if there are consecutive '1's ('11'), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, if the count of '1's is exactly 1, it also prints 'NO'. The output will contain `t` such responses, one for each input string `s`.
