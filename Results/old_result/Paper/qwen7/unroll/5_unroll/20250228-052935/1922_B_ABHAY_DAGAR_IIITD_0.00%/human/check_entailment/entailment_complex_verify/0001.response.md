### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `a_i`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count how many times each stick length appears.
   - This part is correct and necessary to determine the number of sticks of each length.

3. **Calculating Number of Ways to Form a Triangle:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
   - The logic here is flawed:
     - To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
     - The current implementation does not check this condition.
     - Instead, it seems to be counting combinations of sticks without considering the triangle inequality theorem.

4. **Combination Calculations:**
   - The program calculates combinations using:
     - `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` which is the combination formula for choosing 3 items from `cnt` items.
     - `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` which is also a combination formula but seems to be used incorrectly.
   - These calculations do not account for the triangle inequality theorem.

#### Example Analysis

Let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `35`
  - The program will count all combinations of 3 sticks, which is `7 choose 3 = 35`. However, since all sticks have the same length, no triangle can be formed (as per the triangle inequality theorem).

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `4 3 2 1 3`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - The program will count the combinations of sticks, but again, it does not check the triangle inequality. The correct answer should be 2 (choosing the 1st, 2nd, and 4th stick or the 1st, 3rd, and 4th stick).

#### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the chosen sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        for a, cnt in num_of_lens.items():
            for b, cnt_b in num_of_lens.items():
                if a < b:
                    for c, cnt_c in num_of_lens.items():
                        if b < c:
                            if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
                                if a == b == c:
                                    res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
                                elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
                                    res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * cnt_b // 6
                                else:
                                    res += cnt * cnt_b * cnt_c
        results.append(res)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version checks the triangle inequality theorem for each combination of sticks and counts only those combinations that form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Conclusion

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to check the triangle inequality theorem, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
