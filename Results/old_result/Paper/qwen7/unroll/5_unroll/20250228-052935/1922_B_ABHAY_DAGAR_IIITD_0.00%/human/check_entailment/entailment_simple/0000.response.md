Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes the function `func_1` with these test cases.
2. Inside `func_1`, the program iterates over each test case, reading the number of sticks (`n`) and the list of exponents (`num_list`).
3. It then creates a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent.
4. The program calculates the number of ways to form triangles using combinations of the same and different exponents.
   - For each exponent count (`cnt`), it adds to `res`:
     - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks with the same exponent (if there are at least 3 such sticks).
     - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks with one exponent and 1 stick with another exponent (if there are at least 2 sticks with one exponent and at least 1 stick with another exponent).
5. After processing all test cases, the program prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps described, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accounts for all possible ways to form non-degenerate triangles using the given sticks and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
