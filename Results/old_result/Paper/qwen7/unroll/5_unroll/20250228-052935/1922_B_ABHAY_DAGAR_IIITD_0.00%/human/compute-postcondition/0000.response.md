Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged, as no operations are performed on its contents. Therefore, the output state retains the information that `test_cases` is a list of tuples with the specified structure, and `results` is an empty list.
