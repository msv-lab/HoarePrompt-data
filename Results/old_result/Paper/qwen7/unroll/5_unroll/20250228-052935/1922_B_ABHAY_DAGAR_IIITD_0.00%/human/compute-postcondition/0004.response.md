Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `result` and the list `results`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. Therefore, `results` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `result` will take on the value of each element in the `results` list during each iteration.

3. **Initial state before the loop**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the calculated value of `res` for each test case after executing the loop.

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, `results` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `result` will be the first element of the `results` list.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: `results` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `result` is the first element of the `results` list.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`results` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, and `result` is the first element of the `results` list**.
