Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. Here, the loop variable `_` is used (which is typically an underscore when the loop variable is not needed), and the range function takes `test_cases` as its argument.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the value of `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0.

3. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state given is that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is an empty list. However, for the loop to execute, we only need to focus on `test_cases`.

4. **Formulate the adjusted state**: Since the loop depends on `test_cases` being greater than 0, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**.
