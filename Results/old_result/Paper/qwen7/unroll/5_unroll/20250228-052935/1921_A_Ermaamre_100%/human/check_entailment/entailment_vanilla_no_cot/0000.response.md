Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners and stores them in a list of lists `a`.
3. It extracts the x-coordinates into a separate list `x`.
4. It calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), which represents the side length of the square.
5. Finally, it prints the square of this difference (`dx * dx`), which gives the area of the square.

Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates between the farthest points will be equal to the side length of the square. Similarly, the difference in y-coordinates would yield the same result, confirming the square's side length. Thus, the program correctly computes the area of the square for any valid input as per the problem statement.
