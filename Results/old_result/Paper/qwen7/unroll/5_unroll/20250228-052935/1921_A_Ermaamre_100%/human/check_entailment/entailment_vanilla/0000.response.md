### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, so the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will give us the side length, and similarly for the y-coordinates.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (x, y).
   - It then extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x`.
   - The side length of the square is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`), and since the square is aligned with the axes, this difference is the same as the side length.
   - Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is `dx * dx`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for finding the side length of the square is correct because the square is aligned with the axes.
   - The calculation of the area `dx * dx` is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the input correctly and computes the area accurately for any valid set of coordinates provided in the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly calculates the area of the square for the given problem statement.
