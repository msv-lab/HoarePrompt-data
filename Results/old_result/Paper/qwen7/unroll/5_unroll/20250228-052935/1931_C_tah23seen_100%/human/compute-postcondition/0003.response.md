Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.

2. **Analyze each part of the loop condition**:
   - `i < len(arr) - 1`: This checks if `i` is less than the second-to-last index of `arr`.
   - `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`: This checks if the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`.

3. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is currently 0.
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For `i < len(arr) - 1` to be true, `i` must be less than the second-to-last index of `arr`. Since `i` is currently 0, this part of the condition is satisfied as long as `len(arr) > 1`.
   - For `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` to be true, the element at index `i` (which is 0) must be equal to the element at index `i + 1` (which is 1).

5. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - We need to ensure that `arr[0] == arr[1]` for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the elements at indices 0 and 1 are equal.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and `arr[0]` must be equal to `arr[1]`**
