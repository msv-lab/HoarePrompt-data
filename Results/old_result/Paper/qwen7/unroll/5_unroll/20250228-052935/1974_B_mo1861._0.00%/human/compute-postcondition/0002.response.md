Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `c`, `b`, and the operations performed within the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `i` is the index variable.
   - `c` is the character variable.
   - `b` is the original list or iterable that is being processed.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.
   - `set(b)` removes duplicates from `b`.
   - `sorted(set(b))` sorts the unique elements in `b`.
   - `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))` provides both the index and the sorted unique characters.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `b` must contain at least one unique element after removing duplicates and sorting.
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 and `c` being the first sorted unique character in `b`.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `char_map` remains an empty dictionary.
   - `b` must contain at least one unique element.
   - `i` should start at 0.
   - `c` should be the first sorted unique character in `b`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`char_map` is an empty dictionary, `b` must contain at least one unique element, `i` is 0, `c` is the first sorted unique character in `b`**
