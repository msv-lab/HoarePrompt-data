Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires decoding an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating a sorted string `r` of unique characters from `s` and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the reverse of `r`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
   - The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding `b`.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - `char_map` is constructed such that each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
   - This means the most frequent character in the sorted unique set of `b` will map to 'z', the next one to 'y', and so on.
   - The decoded string `s` is then formed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for constructing `char_map` is correct because it ensures that characters are mapped in the reverse order of their sorted positions.
   - The decoding process correctly replaces each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`, thus restoring the original string `s`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
