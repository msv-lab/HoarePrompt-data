Output State: **The program returns a string `s` which is formed by replacing each character in `b` with another character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`**.

To break it down:
- `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
- `s` is a string formed by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value from `char_map`.
- The function simply returns the string `s`.
