You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `b` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `s`. Each character in `b` is replaced by another character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded strings. Specifically, the issue lies in the `char_map` construction within the `func_1` function. The mapping is incorrectly created such that characters are mapped to their symmetric positions in the alphabet, but the logic for determining the symmetric character is flawed.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "ttf"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should consist of all distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically. For `s = "fft"`, the auxiliary string `r` would be `"ft"`. However, the program incorrectly maps characters as follows:
- 't' (which appears twice) should map to 't' (since it's the middle character in "ft").
- 'f' should map to 'f'.

The correct mapping should be:
- 't' -> 't'
- 'f' -> 'f'

But the current implementation maps:
- 't' -> 'f'
- 'f' -> 't'

This is because the program incorrectly calculates the symmetric position using `ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1)`, which does not account for the actual symmetric character in the sorted unique string `r`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly construct the `char_map` based on the sorted unique characters of the encoded string `b`. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    char_map = {c: r[len(r) - 1 - i] for i, c in enumerate(r)}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings according to the problem description.
