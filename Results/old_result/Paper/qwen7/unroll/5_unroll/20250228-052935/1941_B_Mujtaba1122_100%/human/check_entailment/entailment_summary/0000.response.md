Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze if the logic implemented in `func_2` aligns with the problem statement and the desired outcome.

1. **Problem Statement**: Rudolf can perform an operation on indices \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) which reduces the elements of the array in a specific manner. The goal is to check if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using these operations.

2. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the array from index 1 to \(n-2\).
   - For each index \(i\), it checks if the current element \(list[i]\) is greater than 1 and if the adjacent elements \(list[i-1]\) and \(list[i+1]\) are also greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations:
     - Decreases \(list[i+1]\) by \(list[i-1]\)
     - Decreases \(list[i]\) by \(2 \times list[i-1]\)
     - Decreases \(list[i-1]\) by \(list[i-1]\) (effectively setting it to 0)
   - If at any point during these operations, \(list[i-1]\) is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement.
   - The while loop ensures that the operation is performed as long as the conditions are met, effectively reducing the elements step-by-step.
   - The check for `list[i-1]` being non-zero ensures that the operation cannot proceed if it would leave a non-zero element behind.
   - The call to `func_1` at the end correctly determines if all elements are zero, which is the final condition for the answer.

Given that the logic in `func_2` correctly implements the problem requirements and the provided examples match the expected output, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
