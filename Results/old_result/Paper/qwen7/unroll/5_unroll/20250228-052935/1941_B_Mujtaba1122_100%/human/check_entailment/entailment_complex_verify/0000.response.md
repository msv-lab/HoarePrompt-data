### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step and compare it with the expected behavior based on the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element.
- If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
- It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 and applies the operation if the conditions are met.
- If at any point the operation fails (i.e., `list[i-1]` becomes non-zero), it prints "NO" and returns.
- If the loop completes without printing "NO", it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
- If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of `func_2`. It ensures that the array is modified according to the rules and checks if all elements become zero.
- The function handles the operations correctly and ensures that no element violates the constraints.
- The final check with `func_1` ensures that the array is indeed reduced to all zeros if the operations were successful.

Given the annotated code and the problem description, the program appears to be implementing the logic correctly. It checks the necessary conditions and applies the operations in a way that ensures the array can be reduced to all zeros if possible.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- The original assessment suggested that the program might incorrectly output "YES" for certain cases. However, upon closer inspection, the annotated code shows that the program correctly handles the operations and checks the necessary conditions.
- The test case provided in the original assessment (`[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`) is handled correctly by the program. The middle element `4` cannot be reduced to zero, and the program correctly outputs "NO".

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The original assessment was overly critical and did not account for the correct handling of the operations and conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
