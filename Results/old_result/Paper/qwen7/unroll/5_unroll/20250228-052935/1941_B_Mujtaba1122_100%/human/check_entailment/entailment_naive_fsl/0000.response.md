Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

However, the current implementation might incorrectly output "YES" for this case. Here's why:

- In the given array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the middle element `4` cannot be reduced to zero because it requires reducing both `2` and `5` to zero, which is not possible without violating the constraints of the operations.

The current implementation does not check if the sum of the array elements is even, which is a necessary condition for making all elements zero. Additionally, it does not properly handle cases where the array elements are not reducible to zero due to the constraints of the operations.

To fix this, the program should check if the sum of the array elements is even and also ensure that no element prevents the reduction process. A corrected approach would involve checking these conditions and ensuring that the operations are applied correctly to reduce the array to all zeros.
