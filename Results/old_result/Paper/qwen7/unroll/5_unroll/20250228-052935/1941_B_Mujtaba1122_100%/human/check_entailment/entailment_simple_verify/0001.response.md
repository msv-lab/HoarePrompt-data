### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` can be reduced to zero using the allowed operations.
   - If `list[i]` is greater than 1, and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is designed to ensure that if the operations can make all elements zero, it will do so.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the operations. Specifically, the operation `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` effectively sets `list[i-1]` to zero, but the subsequent operations might still depend on `list[i-1]` being non-zero, leading to incorrect behavior.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Operation Execution**: 
  - When `list[i]` is reduced, the value of `list[i-1]` is also reduced. However, the operation `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` sets `list[i-1]` to zero, which means that subsequent operations involving `list[i-1]` will fail because `list[i-1]` is now zero.
  - For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`. The first operation would set `list[2]` to 4, `list[3]` to 3, and `list[1]` to 0. The next operation would then fail because `list[1]` is zero, even though it could potentially be zeroed out further.

- **Correctness of Operations**:
  - The operations should be applied in a way that maintains the integrity of the array without prematurely setting elements to zero. The current implementation incorrectly reduces `list[i-1]` to zero before the necessary operations can be completed.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the implementation of the operations in `func_2` is flawed. The operations should not reduce `list[i-1]` to zero until all dependent operations have been completed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
