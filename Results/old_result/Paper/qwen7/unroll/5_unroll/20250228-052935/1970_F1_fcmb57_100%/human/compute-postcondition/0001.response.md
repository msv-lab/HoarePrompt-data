Output State: **`a` is assigned to `x`, `b` is assigned to `y`, `dx` is `b`, and `dy` is undefined.**

Explanation: The code `dx, dy = b` attempts to unpack the tuple `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. However, since `b` is a single value (not a tuple), the assignment will only assign `b` to `dx`, and `dy` will remain undefined. The values of `a` and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state.
