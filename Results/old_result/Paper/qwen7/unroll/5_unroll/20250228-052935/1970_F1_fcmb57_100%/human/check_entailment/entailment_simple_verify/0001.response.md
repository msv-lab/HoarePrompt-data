### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step against the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\) of the field.
   - It correctly processes the grid and extracts the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The number of players \(P\) and the number of steps \(T\) are correctly identified.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function is defined to update the player's position based on the movement direction.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of `func_1`. The function should return a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)` but instead, it incorrectly returns `x` and `dy` separately. This means the function does not actually update the player's position correctly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic checks if a player's position matches a goal of the opposing team and increments the score accordingly.
   - The program prints the appropriate messages when a goal is scored.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly prints the score updates and the final score in the required format.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  ```python
  def func_1(a, b):
      x, y = a
      dx, dy = b
      return x + dx, y + dy
  ```
  The function is supposed to update the player's position based on the movement direction. However, the return statement is incorrect. It should return a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)` but instead, it returns `x` and `dy` separately. This means the player's position is not updated correctly.

- **Player Movement**:
  ```python
  if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
      players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
  ```
  Since `func_1` returns incorrect values, the player's position is not updated correctly. This can lead to incorrect scoring and incorrect final score.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the `func_1` function does not correctly update the player's position. This leads to incorrect player movements and, consequently, incorrect scoring and final score.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function, which does not update the player's position correctly.
