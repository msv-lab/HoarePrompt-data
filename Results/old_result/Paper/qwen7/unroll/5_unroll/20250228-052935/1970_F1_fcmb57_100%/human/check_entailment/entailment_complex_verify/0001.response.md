### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the initial grid and extracts the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It also correctly identifies the number of moves to be processed.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function is intended to update the player's position based on the movement direction. However, the function implementation is incorrect. Specifically, the function should return a new tuple with the updated coordinates, but the current implementation returns individual coordinates `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` instead of a tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
   - The line `return x + dx, y + dy` should be `return (x + dx, y + dy)` to correctly update the player's position.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into their opponent's goal, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the appropriate message is printed.
   - However, the function `func_1` not returning the correct updated position could lead to incorrect movement handling, which might affect the scoring logic indirectly if the player's position is not updated properly.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the score updates and the final score in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` is not correctly updating the player's position. This could lead to incorrect movement handling, which might affect the scoring logic. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
