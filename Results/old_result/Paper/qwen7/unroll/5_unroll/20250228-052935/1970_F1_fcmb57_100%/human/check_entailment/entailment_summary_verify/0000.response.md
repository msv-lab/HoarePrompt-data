### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two tuples `a` and `b` as input parameters.
   - It extracts the coordinates from these tuples and returns them along with the movement direction.
   - The function is used to update the player's position based on the movement direction.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the dimensions of the field and the initial state of the field.
   - It reads the number of moves and processes each move.
   - For each move:
     - If the move is a movement (`ULDR`), it updates the player's position using `func_1`.
     - If the move is a throw (`T`), it checks if the player's position is in the opponent's goal and updates the score accordingly.

3. **Handling the Throw Action:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle, the program checks if the player's position is in the opponent's goal.
   - If the player's position is in the opponent's goal, the program increments the opponent's score and prints the appropriate message.
   - The Quaffle is then moved to the middle of the field, which is handled implicitly by the fact that the player's position is updated to the middle of the field.

4. **Checking the Example Input:**
   - Consider the example input provided:
     ```
     5 5
     .. R1 .. B1 ..
     RG .. .. .. BG
     RG R0 .Q B0 BG
     RG .. .. .. BG
     .. R2 .. B2 ..
     13
     R0 R
     R0 C .Q
     R0 D
     R0 R
     R0 R
     R0 T
     ```
   - After the player `R0` throws the Quaffle, the program checks if the player's position is in the blue goal.
   - Since the player's position is now the middle of the field, the program correctly identifies that the blue team has scored a point and prints "12 BLUE GOAL".

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, as it updates the score and prints the appropriate message.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle and it lands in the wrong goal. However, upon closer inspection, the program correctly updates the score and prints the appropriate message when this happens. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
