Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the smallest and largest remaining elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. For instance, consider the input:

```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```

The program's output would be `1`, but the correct maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, resulting in a beauty of `1 + 0 + 1 = 2`.

The program fails to consider all possible permutations that could maximize the beauty, particularly when there are duplicate values or specific orderings that could lead to higher differences. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
