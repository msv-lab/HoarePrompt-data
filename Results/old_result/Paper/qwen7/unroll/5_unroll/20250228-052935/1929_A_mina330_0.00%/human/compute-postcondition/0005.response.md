Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.**
