Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `a` (list of integers representing the cards in your hand) and `n` (number of cards).
   - Inside `func_1`, a dictionary `count_a` is used to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - The function then iterates through the range from 1 to `n` and checks if each integer exists in `count_a` and if it has exactly two occurrences.
   - If an integer has exactly two occurrences, it increments the `max_score` variable.
   - Finally, the function returns `max_score`.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only considers cards that appear exactly twice in your hand. However, the problem states that each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the entire deck, and Nene will play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours.
   - To achieve the optimal score, you need to consider the following:
     - If you play a card, Nene will play the same card to gain a point.
     - Therefore, you can only score a point if you play a card that Nene hasn't played yet.
     - Since Nene will play optimally, she will ensure that you don't get any points by playing the same card before you do.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players.
   - You should keep track of which cards have been played and calculate the maximum possible score you can get by considering the remaining cards and Nene's optimal strategy.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The current implementation only considers cards that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not sufficient to handle the optimal play scenario.

**Correctness: False**
