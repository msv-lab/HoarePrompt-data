Output State: **_min_edge remains positive infinity (float('inf')), node_u and node_v remain -1; colors is a list of length n+1 where all elements are 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `colors` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `_min_edge`, `node_u`, or `node_v`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
