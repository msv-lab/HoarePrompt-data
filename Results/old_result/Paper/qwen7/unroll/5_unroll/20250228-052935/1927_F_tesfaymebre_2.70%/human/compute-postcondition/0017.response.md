Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables (n, m, edges, DSU) where n and m are integers with specific constraints, edges is a list of tuples representing weighted edges, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure. The function processes these inputs to perform some operation and returns a result based on the given conditions.**
