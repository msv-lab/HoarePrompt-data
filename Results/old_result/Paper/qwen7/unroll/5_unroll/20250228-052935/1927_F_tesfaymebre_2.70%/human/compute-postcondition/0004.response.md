Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines of three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` representing the vertices and the weight of the edge between them. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the given test cases according to the described structure.**
