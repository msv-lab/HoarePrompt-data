Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a test identifier `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `a`. The function processes these inputs according to specified rules but does not explicitly accept these parameters as arguments. Instead, it infers them from the context or input data structure.
