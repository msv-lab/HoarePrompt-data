Output State: **The value of `left` or `right` that minimizes the absolute difference with \((n + 1) / 2\), with ties broken by choosing the smallest index. If no such position can balance the number of zeros and ones, the output is the index that results in a balanced state closest to the center.**

This output state describes the final value of either `left` or `right` after the loop has executed all its iterations, based on the conditions provided in the code. The goal is to find a point in the string `s` where the number of zeros and ones on both sides is as balanced as possible, favoring the smaller index in case of ties.
