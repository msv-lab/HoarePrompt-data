State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will run `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` generates a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 20000 (inclusive).
4. Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0 to execute, we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
