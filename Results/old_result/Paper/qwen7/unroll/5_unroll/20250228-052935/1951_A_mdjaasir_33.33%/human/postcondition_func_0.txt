The function processes multiple inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by a binary string `a`. It checks the number of '1's in the string `a` and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions. If the count of '1's is 0, it prints 'YES'. If the count is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count is exactly 2, it checks if there is exactly one '1' with no adjacent '1's; if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. For all other cases, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each input.
