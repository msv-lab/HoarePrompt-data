Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array elements.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   
3. **Loop Through Array Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning (`m - 1` to `0`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element is less than the previous element.
   
4. **Digit Splitting and Sorting Check**:
   - If the current element is less than the previous element, the program splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element.
   - It then checks if the combined list of digits is sorted.
   - If not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   
5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**:
   - The logic for splitting the digits and checking if the combined list is sorted is flawed.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and inserting digits back into the array.
   - The check `if nums != sorted(nums)` is not sufficient because it only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted, but it does not reflect the actual transformation of the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Array Transformation**:
   - The program does not actually modify the original array to reflect the digit-splitting operation.
   - Instead, it only checks if the hypothetical combination of digits is sorted, which does not guarantee that the array can be sorted by the given operation.

### Correctness

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the required operation and cannot accurately determine if the array can be sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **False**
