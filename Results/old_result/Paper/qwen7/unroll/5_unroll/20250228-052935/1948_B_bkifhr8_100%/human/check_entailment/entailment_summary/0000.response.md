Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The program attempts to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent elements at most once, but the problem requires breaking down elements into their constituent digits and reinserting them. This means the program should be checking if the array can be transformed by splitting larger numbers into smaller ones and reordering, not just by swapping adjacent elements.

The program's logic is flawed because:
1. It tries to compare and swap adjacent elements, which is not what the problem requires.
2. It does not handle the process of breaking down and reinserting digits as specified in the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program cannot correctly determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
