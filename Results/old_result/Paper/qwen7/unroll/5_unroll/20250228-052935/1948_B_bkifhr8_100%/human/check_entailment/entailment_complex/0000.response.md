Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits and comparing them with the previous element.
2. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by only considering one swap (splitting an element and comparing it with the previous element). This is not sufficient to ensure the entire array can be sorted.
3. The program should check if the array can be sorted by repeatedly applying the operation until no more changes can be made, rather than just checking after one pass.
4. The program also does not handle the case where the array is already sorted correctly, as it incorrectly sets `ans` to `False` even if the array was already sorted before any operations were applied.

Given these issues, the provided program is not correct for solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
