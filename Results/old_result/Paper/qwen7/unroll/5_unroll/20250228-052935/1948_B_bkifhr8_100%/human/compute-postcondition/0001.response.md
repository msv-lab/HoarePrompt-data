Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\), it is guaranteed that `n` will be greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Given that `n` is already within the valid range, no adjustment is needed for `n`. However, we need to initialize the throwaway variable `_` to start the loop.

4. **Initial Values**: The initial value of `_` is not specified, but since it is a throwaway variable, its specific value is not important for the loop to start. It simply needs to be set to some value to begin the loop iterations.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- The variable `_` should be initialized to some value (though the specific value is not critical).
- The variable `n` should be within the valid range (which it already is).

Since the specific value of `_` is not crucial, we can simply state that it is ready to start the loop.

**Final State**:
State: **`_` is a placeholder value, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50**
