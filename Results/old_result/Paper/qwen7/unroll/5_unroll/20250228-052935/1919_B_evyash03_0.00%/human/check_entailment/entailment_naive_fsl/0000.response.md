Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not handle the calculation of penalties for the subarrays formed during the splitting process.

The program attempts to split the string based on the '-' character and then counts the number of segments, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the total penalty. The program also does not compute the penalties for these segments according to the given rules.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The expected output is `4`, but the program will incorrectly output a different value because it does not properly calculate the penalties for the optimal segmentation of the array.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not achieve this.
