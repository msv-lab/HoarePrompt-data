### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not solve the problem as stated. Let's break down why the program is incorrect and how the function `func_1` fails to meet the requirements:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation:**
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into subarrays.
   - The penalty for each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the penalty at all; instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes below zero during the iteration through the string `expression`.

2. **Misunderstanding of Optimal Splitting:**
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty, which means splitting the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - The function `func_1` only ensures that the balance does not go below zero, but it does not consider the actual penalty calculation or the optimal way to split the array.

3. **Function `func_1` Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and counts the number of times the balance goes below zero.
   - It then returns this count plus an additional 1 if the final balance is positive.
   - This approach does not guarantee the minimum penalty and is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as required by the problem statement.
