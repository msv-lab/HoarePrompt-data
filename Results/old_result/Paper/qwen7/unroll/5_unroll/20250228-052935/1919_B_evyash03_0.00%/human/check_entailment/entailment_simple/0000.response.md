### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty is calculated based on the absolute value of the sum of each segment multiplied by its length.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string itself.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` with the string `expression` and its length.
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression`, tracking the balance of `+` and `-` characters.
   - If the balance goes below zero, it increments the `count` and resets the balance to zero.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus one if the final balance is positive.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of times the balance goes below zero during the iteration.
   - The logic ensures that each time the balance goes below zero, a new segment is started, which aligns with the requirement to minimize the penalty.
   - The final check for a positive balance ensures that any remaining positive balance contributes to the penalty.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles strings with only `+` or `-` correctly.
   - It correctly identifies segments that need to be separated to minimize the penalty.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the correct number of segments needed to achieve the minimum penalty.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.

### Correctness:
**True**
