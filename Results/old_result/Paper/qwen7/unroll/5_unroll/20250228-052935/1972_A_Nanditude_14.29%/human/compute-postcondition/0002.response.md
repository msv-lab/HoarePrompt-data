Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list containing two lists. The first list consists of `n` non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems, and the second list consists of `n` non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties. After sorting both lists in descending order, the function returns a new list of two lists with the same structure but with the integers sorted in descending order.**
