Output State: **The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems, and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected maximum difficulties, but both lists are sorted in descending order.**

This means that the program sorts the first list (difficulties) and the second list (expected maximum difficulties) in descending order and then returns them as a single list of two lists.
