Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns a result derived from those parameters without being explicitly defined in the function signature.
