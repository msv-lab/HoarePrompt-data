Output State: The output state will be an integer indicating the index `i` (0-indexed) that minimizes the absolute difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the two halves of the string `s`, ensuring that the left half has at most one more element than the right half. If there are multiple indices with the same minimal difference, the smallest index among them is chosen.
