Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits the string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`.
   - This part seems correct as long as the input format is strictly followed.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Problem Description Analysis:

- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight:

- The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
- If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can also remove a coin and maintain the even sum).
- If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the sum to become even after her move, leaving Bob in a losing position.

### Verification:

- The given program correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
- It prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd, which aligns with the optimal strategy analysis.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
