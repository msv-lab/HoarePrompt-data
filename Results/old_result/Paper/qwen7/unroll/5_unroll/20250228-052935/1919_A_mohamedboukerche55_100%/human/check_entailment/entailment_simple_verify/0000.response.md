### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing one coin from their respective wallets. The player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both players play optimally, meaning they will always choose the best possible move to win.

#### Game Logic:
- If a player has 1 coin, they will remove it and then swap wallets with the opponent, leaving the opponent with 1 coin and the player with 0 coins. The player who had 1 coin will then lose because they cannot make a move.
- If a player has more than 1 coin, they will remove one coin and then swap wallets if it benefits them (i.e., it leaves the opponent in a worse position).

#### Key Insight:
The game's outcome depends on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins. If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. It then checks if the sum of these coins is even or odd and prints "Bob" or "Alice" accordingly.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
- This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement. If the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins. If the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner based on the optimal play described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement.
