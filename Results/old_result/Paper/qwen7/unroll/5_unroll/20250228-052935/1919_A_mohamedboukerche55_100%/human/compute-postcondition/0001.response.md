Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. Specifically, `range(t)` will generate values from 0 to `t-1`, so `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Initial States of Variables**:
   - `a` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq b \leq 10^9\).
   - `t` is an input integer (no specific range given initially).

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since the loop depends on `t`, `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - The initial values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer**
