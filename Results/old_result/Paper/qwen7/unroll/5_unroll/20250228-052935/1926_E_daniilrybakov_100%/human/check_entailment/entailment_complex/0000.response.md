Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the logic implemented in the function aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem describes a specific sequence in which Vladislav lays down cards. The sequence is determined by the multiples of odd numbers (1, 2*1, 3*1, 4*1, ...).

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
   - It enters a while loop where it calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, updates `n` to `n // 2`, and checks if `k` falls within the current segment defined by `s` and `s + x`.
   - If `k` falls within the current segment, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `s` and `m` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the calculated value \((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m\).

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the segment where the \( k \)-th card falls.
   - The calculation \((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m\) accurately determines the position of the card within that segment.
   - The example outputs match the expected results based on the described sequence.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the \( k \)-th card laid down by Vladislav.

Correctness: **True**
