Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \) within certain constraints. Specifically, it computes \((2 \times (k - s) - 1) \times m\), where \( s \) and \( m \) are derived through a series of operations involving \( n \) and \( k \).**
