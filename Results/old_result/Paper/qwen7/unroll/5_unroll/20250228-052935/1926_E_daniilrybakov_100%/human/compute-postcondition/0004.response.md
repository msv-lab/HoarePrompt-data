Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. It returns different outputs based on the values of n and k within specified ranges.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k. The function checks if k is within the range 1 to n and if n is within the range 1 to \(10^9\), and t is within the range 1 to \(5 \times 10^4\). Based on these conditions, the function returns specific outputs for each test case.
