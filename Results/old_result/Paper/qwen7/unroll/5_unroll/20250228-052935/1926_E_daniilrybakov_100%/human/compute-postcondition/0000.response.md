Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, and now `t` is specifically set to the integer value entered by the user.
