Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO", which is incorrect according to the problem description. Additionally, the program uses `x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]` to check if the character `x` from `c` is not present in the corresponding position of `a` and `b`. This approach is flawed because it only checks for the absence of the character, not its presence in the correct form (lowercase vs. uppercase).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
3
2
aa
bb
AA
```

In this case, both `a` and `b` match the template "AA", but `c` also matches the template "AA" since both `a` and `b` contain 'A' in their respective positions. Therefore, the output should be "YES" because there exists a template "AA" that makes both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print "NO" because `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`.

A correct implementation would involve constructing a template based on the characters in `a` and `b` and then checking if `c` does not match this template.
