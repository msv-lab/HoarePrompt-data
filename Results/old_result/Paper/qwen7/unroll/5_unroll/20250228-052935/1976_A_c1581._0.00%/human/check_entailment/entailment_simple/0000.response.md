Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to check the conditions for a strong password:
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if there is a digit coming after a letter.
   - It sorts the digits and letters and checks if they are in non-decreasing order.
3. The logic in `func_1` is sound:
   - It iterates through the password and ensures that if a digit is found, all subsequent characters must also be digits until the end of the password.
   - It then checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. The function returns 'NO' if any of the conditions fail and 'YES' if all conditions are met.
5. The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem description and the example cases provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
