### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided example cases.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.

2. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The code initializes two indices `i` and `j`. `i` is used to iterate through the list `l`, and `j` is used to check if the condition for printing `2` is met.
   - The while loop iterates from `0` to `n-1` and checks if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If this condition is met, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.
   - If the condition is not met after the loop, it prints `3`.

3. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The given logic does not correctly handle all possible scenarios. Specifically, it only checks for a very specific pair of friends (`i+2` and `i+1`) and does not consider other possible pairs that could also result in at least 2 friends coming to the party.

4. **Example Cases:**
   - **Example 1:** `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
     - The code incorrectly prints `2` because it only checks for the pair `(3, 4)` and does not consider other pairs like `(1, 2)`.
   - **Example 2:** `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
     - The code incorrectly prints `3` because it does not find any pair that satisfies the condition.
   - **Example 3:** `p = [2, 1]`
     - The code incorrectly prints `2` because it only checks for the pair `(1, 2)` and does not consider the fact that both friends need to be invited.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
