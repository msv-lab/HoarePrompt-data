Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( p \) of \( n \) distinct integers. It checks if there exists an index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \)) such that \( p[i] = i + 2 \) and \( p[i + 1] = i + 1 \). If such an index is found, it prints 2 for that test case; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.**
