Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Best Friends**: The program checks for a specific pattern (`p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`) which does not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can be invited. For example, in the third test case where `p = [2, 1]`, the program should find that inviting both friends 1 and 2 will make both attend, but it incorrectly prints 2.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while i <= n - 1:` is incorrect because it should only iterate up to `n-2` to avoid out-of-range errors when checking `p[i+1]`.

3. **Handling All Scenarios**: The logic needs to check all possible pairs of friends to ensure that at least 2 friends can be invited. The current logic only checks a very specific and limited scenario.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

Correctness: **False**
