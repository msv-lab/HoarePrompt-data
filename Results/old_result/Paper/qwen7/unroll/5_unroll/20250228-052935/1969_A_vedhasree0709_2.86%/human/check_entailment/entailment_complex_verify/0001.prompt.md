You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, if there exists an index i (0 ≤ i < n-1) where l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1, then the output will be 2 for that test case; otherwise, the output will be 3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( p \) of \( n \) distinct integers. It checks if there exists an index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n-1 \)) such that \( p[i] = i + 2 \) and \( p[i + 1] = i + 1 \). If such an index is found, it prints 2 for that test case; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Loop Through Friends**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the list of friends.
   - It checks if the current friend `i` and their best friend `l[i]` form a specific pattern where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`.

3. **Pattern Check**:
   - If the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met, the program prints `2` and sets `j` to `1`, breaking out of the loop.
   - If no such pattern is found, the program prints `3`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Pattern Check**:
   - The program only checks for the specific pattern `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. This is too restrictive and does not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can be invited.

2. **Handling All Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all possible configurations of `p_i` values. It assumes a very specific pattern which is not always present in the input data.

3. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**:
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of invitations required is flawed. The program does not consider all possible pairs of friends that can be invited together.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5`
   - `3 1 2 5 4`
   - The program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 4 and 5 can be invited as they are each other's best friends.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4`
   - `2 3 4 1`
   - The program prints `3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because friends 1, 2, and 3 can be invited as they form a cycle where each pair of friends can invite each other.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2`
   - `2 1`
   - The program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 can be invited as they are each other's best friends.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. It only checks for a specific pattern and does not handle all possible configurations of the input data.
