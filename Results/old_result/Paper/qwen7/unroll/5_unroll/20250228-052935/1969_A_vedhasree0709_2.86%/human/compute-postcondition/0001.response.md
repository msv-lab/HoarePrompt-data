Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, if there exists an index i (0 ≤ i ≤ n-2) such that l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1, the output will be 2 for that test case; otherwise, the output will be 3 for that test case.
