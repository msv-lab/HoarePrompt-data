Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, which is a placeholder used to indicate that the loop variable is not being used within the loop body.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since `_` is a placeholder and not used, the loop will execute as long as the condition `int(input())` evaluates to a positive integer. Given the state before the loop, we know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means that `int(input())` will always return a value between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), ensuring that the loop will execute.

3. **Adjust the State**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is the one related to the input that will determine how many times the loop will run. Since `t` is the number of test cases, and the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
