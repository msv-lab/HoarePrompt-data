Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and prints their difference. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
6
+-+-+-
10
--+++++++-
20
+---++++-+++++---
```

Expected Output:
```
0
0
0
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
4
4
```

The program fails to consider the optimal splitting of the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty. For example, in the third test case `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the program incorrectly calculates the penalty without considering the optimal splits. The correct solution would involve splitting the array into segments where the sum of elements in each segment is zero or close to zero, which the current program does not achieve.
