Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string but does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. 

To solve this problem optimally, we need to ensure that each segment of the array has a sum of zero or close to zero to minimize the penalty. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        a = [1 if x == '+' else -1 for x in s]
        
        # Initialize variables
        min_penalty = float('inf')
        current_sum = 0
        current_penalty = 0
        
        # Iterate through the array to find the minimum penalty
        for num in a:
            current_sum += num
            current_penalty += abs(current_sum)
            
            # If current_sum is zero, it means we found a segment with sum zero
            if current_sum == 0:
                current_penalty -= abs(current_sum)  # Remove the penalty of this segment since it's zero
                min_penalty = min(min_penalty, current_penalty)
                current_sum = 0
                current_penalty = 0
        
        # Final check for remaining current_penalty
        min_penalty = min(min_penalty, current_penalty)
        
        print(min_penalty)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program iterates through the array and keeps track of the current sum and penalty. Whenever the current sum becomes zero, it updates the minimum penalty accordingly. This ensures that the segments with a sum of zero do not contribute to the penalty, which is the optimal solution for minimizing the total penalty.
