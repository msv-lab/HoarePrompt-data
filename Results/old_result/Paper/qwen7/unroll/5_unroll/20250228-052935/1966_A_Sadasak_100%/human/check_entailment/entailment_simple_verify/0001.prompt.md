You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table

    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1

            frequency_table[num] = k

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This condition is straightforward and correct because if `k` is greater than `n`, no exchanges can be made, and thus the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - `func_1` updates the frequency of each card number to ensure no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Checking Frequency Table:**
   - The program checks if `k` exists in the frequency table.
     - If `k` exists in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - It creates a frequency table using a dictionary.
  - For each card number, it updates the frequency to ensure it does not exceed `k`.
  - This function ensures that no card type has more than `k` cards, but it does not directly solve the problem of minimizing the number of cards.

### Correctness of the Main Logic

- **Case 1: `k > n`:**
  - The program correctly prints `n` because no exchanges can be made.

- **Case 2: `k <= n`:**
  - The program should minimize the number of cards by ensuring that each card type has at most `k` cards.
  - The logic of checking if `k` exists in the frequency table is flawed. The goal is to find the smallest number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the given operations.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: We can reduce the cards to 2 by exchanging groups of 3 cards.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 10 7`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: No operations can be performed, so the answer is 1.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: We can reduce the cards to 1 by exchanging groups of 2 cards.

### Conclusion

The current implementation does not correctly minimize the number of cards. The logic in `func_1` and the main logic need adjustments to ensure the correct minimization of cards.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```
