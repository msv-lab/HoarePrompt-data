Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where `k > n` by immediately printing `n`. This is correct because if `k > n`, we cannot perform any exchanges, so the minimum number of cards left is `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation**: The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table. However, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately represent the problem's requirements. Specifically:
   - The function is supposed to cap the frequency of each number at `k`, but it only updates the frequency table when it exceeds `k`. This means it will not correctly handle cases where multiple numbers need to be reduced to `k-1` cards.
   - The function does not ensure that the frequency table reflects the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.

4. **Output Logic**: The program checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operations described in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The frequency calculation and the logic for determining the minimum number of cards are both incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
