t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, indicating the type of constraint and the value x respectively. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2 for each test case, and all constraints are unique.
