Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases) and an integer n (number of constraints per test case). For each test case, it reads n lines of constraints, where each line contains two integers a and x. Based on the value of a, it categorizes x into either `big`, `less`, or `no`. After processing all constraints, it finds and prints the smallest integer greater than any value in `big` and less than any value in `less`, excluding any values in `no`. If no such integer exists, it prints an undefined value for that test case.**
