Reasoning:
1. The program correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
2. It checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. It checks if there is any digit immediately following a letter, which would violate the rule that no digit can come after a letter.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The program does not check if the digits are sorted before checking for the presence of a digit immediately after a letter. This means that even if the digits are not sorted, the program might still incorrectly return 'YES' if the digits are not followed by a letter.
- The program does not ensure that there are no two consecutive letters where the second letter is smaller than the first, which violates the requirement that all letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
