### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Separating Characters into Lists:**
   - The program correctly separates the characters into two lists: one for letters (`letters`) and one for digits (`digits`).
   - This part of the program is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Checking Sorted Order of Letters:**
   - The program checks if the letters are sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `if (letters != sorted(letters)) :`.
   - If the letters are not sorted, the program correctly returns 'NO'.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Checking Sorted Order of Digits:**
   - The program checks if the digits are sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `if (digits != sorted(digits)) :`.
   - If the digits are not sorted, the program correctly returns 'NO'.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Ensuring No Digit Follows a Letter:**
   - The program iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter using the condition `if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():`.
   - If this condition is violated, the program correctly returns 'NO'.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

6. **Returning 'YES' if All Conditions Are Met:**
   - If all conditions are met, the program correctly returns 'YES'.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or omissions in the code.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
