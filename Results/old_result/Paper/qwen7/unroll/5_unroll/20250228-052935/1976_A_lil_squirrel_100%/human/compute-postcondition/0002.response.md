Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `ch`, which is used to iterate over each character in the string `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `ch`**: Since the loop is iterating over each character in `password`, the variable `ch` will take on the value of each character in `password` one by one.

3. **Initial state of `password`**: The problem states that `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. Before the loop starts, `password` is fully defined but `ch` is not yet assigned any value from `password`.

4. **State adjustments needed**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `password` is a valid string of the specified length and contains only lowercase Latin letters and digits. Additionally, since `ch` will take on the values of characters in `password`, we don't need to explicitly set `ch` before the loop starts, as it will be assigned the values during the loop execution.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `password` should be a valid string of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`) consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
- `letters` and `digits` remain empty lists as they are not directly involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `letters` is an empty list, `digits` is an empty list, and `ch` is not yet assigned a value**.
