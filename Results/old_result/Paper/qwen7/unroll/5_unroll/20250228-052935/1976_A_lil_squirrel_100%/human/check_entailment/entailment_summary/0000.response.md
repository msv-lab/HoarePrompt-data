Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Separation of Characters**: The program correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Adjacency Check**: It ensures there are no instances where a letter is immediately followed by a digit.

Let's analyze the execution summary against the problem statement:

- **Letters Sorted**: The program checks if `letters` are sorted using `sorted(letters)` and compares them. This is correct.
- **Digits Sorted**: Similarly, it checks if `digits` are sorted and compares them. This is also correct.
- **No Letter Followed by Digit**: The program iterates through the password and checks if a letter is followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'. This logic is correct.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly identifies whether the password meets the criteria for being strong. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
