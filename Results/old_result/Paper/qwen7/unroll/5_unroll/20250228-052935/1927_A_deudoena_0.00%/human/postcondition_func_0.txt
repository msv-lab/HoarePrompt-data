The function processes an input string `s` containing characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' (`ind1`) and the index of the last occurrence of 'B' from the end (`ind2`). Finally, it prints and returns the length of the string minus these two indices (`len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`).
