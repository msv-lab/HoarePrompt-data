Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the string input by the user, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.**

Explanation: The code `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the user and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` and the description of `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged conditions along with the new assignment to `inpstr`.
