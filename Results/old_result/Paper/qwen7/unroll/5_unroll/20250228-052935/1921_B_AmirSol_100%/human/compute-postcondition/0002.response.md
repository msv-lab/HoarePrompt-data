Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the number of positions where s1[i] is '0' and s2[i] is '1' and the number of positions where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0', both for i in the range of n.**

This means the program will compare the two counts (`cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`) and return the larger of the two values.
