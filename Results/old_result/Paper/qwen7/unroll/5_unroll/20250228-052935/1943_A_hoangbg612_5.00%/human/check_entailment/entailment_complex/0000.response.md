Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided function to determine if it correctly computes the game's final score based on the given problem statement.

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and its elements.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `N` is sorted, which helps in determining the minimum excludant (MEX) more efficiently.

3. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The function initializes `cur` to `-1` and creates a dictionary `M` to keep track of the count of each number in the sorted array.
   - It iterates through the sorted array and updates the `cur` value and the dictionary `M` accordingly.
   - If a number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop since further numbers will not affect the MEX. Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments the count in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Adjusting `cur`**:
   - After processing the array, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Then, it finds the largest number `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. This step ensures that the MEX is correctly determined based on the counts in `M`.

5. **Output**: The function prints the computed `cur` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to follow the optimal strategy for both players as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the sorting, counting, and determining the MEX based on the counts of numbers in the sorted array.

Therefore, the function is correct in terms of logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
