Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal game outcome. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice and Bob's Moves**: The program does not correctly simulate the alternating moves between Alice and Bob. It treats the entire array as if it were sorted and processed in a single pass, which does not account for the alternating nature of their turns.

2. **Misunderstanding of MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX directly from the sorted array, but it does not properly simulate the game's state after each move. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic inside the loop where it updates `cur` and `M` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game's progression and the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game's turns and track the optimal moves for both players. Here's a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate the game by alternating between Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks an element from the remaining array and Bob removes an element.
2. **Track MEX**: Track the MEX of the array `c` after each move.
3. **Optimal Strategy**: Ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice's turn first
        c = []
        a = A[:]
        b = []
        
        while a or b:
            if len(a) > 0:
                # Alice's turn
                c.append(a.pop(0))
            if len(b) > 0:
                # Bob's turn
                b.pop(0)
        
        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

This code simulates the game correctly by alternating between Alice and Bob's turns and calculates the MEX of the resulting array `c`. This should give the correct output for the given problem.
