State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4, _ is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is used in the loop head but is not assigned a specific value before the loop. It is typically used as a placeholder when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
2. The variable `T` is obtained from `int(input())` and is given to be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
3. For the loop `for _ in range(T):` to execute, `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range.
4. Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition, it doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted.
5. The loop starts with `_` being 0, as `range(T)` generates values from 0 to \(T-1\).

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `T` to ensure it meets the given constraints.
