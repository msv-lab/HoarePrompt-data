Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `n` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and the variable `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `results` is now an empty list.
