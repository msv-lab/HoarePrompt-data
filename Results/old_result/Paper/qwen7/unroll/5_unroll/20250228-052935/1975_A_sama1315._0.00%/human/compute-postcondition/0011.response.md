Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the list of integers and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case on separate lines.**
