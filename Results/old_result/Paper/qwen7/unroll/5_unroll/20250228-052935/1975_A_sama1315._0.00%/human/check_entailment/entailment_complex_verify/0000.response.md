### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires determining if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. This means that after any number of such operations, the array should be in non-decreasing order.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted (`all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If it is, it returns `'Yes'`.
- If the array is not sorted, it checks if there is exactly one pair of elements that are out of order (`any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`). If there is, it returns `'No'`. Otherwise, it returns `'Yes'`.

This approach is flawed because it only checks for one out-of-order pair, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. For example, the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]` has multiple out-of-order pairs, but it cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The function `func_1` indeed only checks for one out-of-order pair, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. It only checks for one out-of-order pair, which is not sufficient.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the array has multiple out-of-order pairs, which cannot be fixed by splitting and swapping.
