You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the list of integers and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case on separate lines.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns 'Yes' if the array is sorted.
   - It returns 'No' if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next element.
   - However, this function does not account for the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`), the size of each array (`n`), and the elements of each array.
   - It then calls `func_1` with each array and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

### Correctness of `func_1`

The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted. It does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by splitting and swapping parts. Therefore, it is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted using the given operation.

### Correctness of `func_2`

Since `func_2` relies on `func_1`, and `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem, `func_2` will also not work as intended. Specifically, `func_2` will incorrectly identify arrays that can be sorted by splitting and swapping as unsorted.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Input**: 
   ```
   3
   6
   1 1 4 5 1 4
   5
   7 9 2 2 3
   3
   1 2 3
   ```

2. **Expected Output**:
   ```
   No
   Yes
   Yes
   ```

3. **Actual Output**:
   - For the first test case `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`, `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - For the second test case `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, `func_1` would return 'No' because the array is not sorted.
   - For the third test case `[1, 2, 3]`, `func_1` would return 'Yes' because the array is already sorted.

However, the expected output shows that the second and third test cases should return 'Yes' because they can be sorted by splitting and swapping parts.

### Conclusion

Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem, the entire program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
