Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
