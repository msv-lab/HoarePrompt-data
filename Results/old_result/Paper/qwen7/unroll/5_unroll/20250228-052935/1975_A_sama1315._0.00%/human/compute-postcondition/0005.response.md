Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the data list at position `index-1`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using spaces, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not change the values of the existing variables (`index`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `data`) but adds a new variable `results` which is an empty list.
