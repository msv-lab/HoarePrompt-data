You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]

        print(*p)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = [-1] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and p is a list of n integers where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i] with mex being the minimum value between the current mex and (mex - a[i]) as the loop iterates backwards from n-1 to 0. After all iterations, p contains the final values computed for each input case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that each element \( p[i] \) is equal to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \), where \( \text{mex} \) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list \( p \) so far. The function then prints the permutation \( p \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Specifically, the logic for calculating the MEX value and assigning values to the permutation \( p \) is flawed.

Let's consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3 2 1 0 4
```

The program initializes `p` with `-1` for all indices and then tries to assign values based on the MEX calculation. However, the logic for updating `mex` and assigning values to `p` is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the assignment of values to ensure that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) appears exactly once in \( p \).

To fix this, we need to ensure that the MEX value is correctly calculated and that each element in \( p \) is assigned a unique value from 0 to \( n-1 \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex
            used.add(mex)
        print(*p)


func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each element in \( p \) is assigned a unique value from 0 to \( n-1 \) and that the MEX value is correctly calculated.
