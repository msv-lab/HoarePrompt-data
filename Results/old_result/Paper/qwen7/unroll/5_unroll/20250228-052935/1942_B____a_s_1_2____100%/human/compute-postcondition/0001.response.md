Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input, it will always be a non-negative integer. However, the loop will not execute if `t` is 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
