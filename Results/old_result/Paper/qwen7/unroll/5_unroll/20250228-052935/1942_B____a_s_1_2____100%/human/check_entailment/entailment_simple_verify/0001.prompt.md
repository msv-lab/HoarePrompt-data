You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; a is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n, and there exists at least one valid permutation p that satisfies the given conditions.

        mex = n
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        
        print(*p)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and p is a list of n integers where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i] with mex being the minimum value between the current mex and (mex - a[i]) as the loop iterates backwards from n-1 to 0. After all iterations, p contains the final values computed for each input case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs a valid permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `p` of size \( n \) with `-1` values.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing Permutation:**
   - The loop runs from \( n-1 \) down to \( 0 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates \( p[i] \) as \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the permutation \( p \).

### Correctness Check:

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Correct Calculation of \( p[i] \):**
   - The calculation \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \) should ensure that \( p[i] \) is the smallest integer not present in \( p[0:i+1] \) minus \( a[i] \).
   - However, this approach might not always yield the correct \( p \) because:
     - The value of `mex` is updated after calculating \( p[i] \), which can lead to incorrect values if the initial `mex` is not correctly maintained.
     - The logic assumes that the current `mex` value is always correct, but this might not hold true if the previous values of \( p \) are not correctly handled.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the calculated \( p[i] \) might be out of bounds (i.e., negative or greater than \( n-1 \)).
   - It also does not ensure that all values in \( p \) are unique and within the range \( [0, n-1] \).

3. **Guaranteed Validity:**
   - The problem statement guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, but the given implementation does not necessarily guarantee that the constructed permutation is valid for all cases.

### Example Verification:

Given the example in the problem statement:
- Test case 1: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
- Expected output: \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)

Let's verify the steps:
- For \( i = 4 \): \( p[4] = \text{mex} - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \), \(\text{mex} = 3\)
- For \( i = 3 \): \( p[3] = \text{mex} - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \(\text{mex} = 2\)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( p[2] = \text{mex} - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \), \(\text{mex} = 4\)
- For \( i = 1 \): \( p[1] = \text{mex} - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3 \), \(\text{mex} = 3\)
- For \( i = 0 \): \( p[0] = \text{mex} - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \(\text{mex} = 2\)

This results in \( p = [2, 3, 4, 2, 3] \), which is not a valid permutation since it contains duplicate values.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly construct a valid permutation \( p \) based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
