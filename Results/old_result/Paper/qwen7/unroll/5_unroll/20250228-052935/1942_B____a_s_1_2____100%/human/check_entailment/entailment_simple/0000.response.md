Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `a`.
3. It initializes a list `p` of size `n` with `-1` to represent an unassigned permutation.
4. It calculates the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) value for the current state of `p` and updates the permutation `p` accordingly.
5. The loop iterates backward from `n-1` to `0`, ensuring that each `p[i]` is set to `mex - a[i]` and then updating `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly assigned `p[i]`.
6. This approach ensures that each `p[i]` is filled with a unique value from `0` to `n-1` because `mex` is always updated to reflect the smallest unused index after assigning `p[i]`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the annotated program should correctly generate a valid permutation `p` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
