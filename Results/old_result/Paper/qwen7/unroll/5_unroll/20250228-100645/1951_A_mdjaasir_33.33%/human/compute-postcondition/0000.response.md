Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The variables `start` and `end` remain unchanged from their initial state, where `start` is an integer less than or equal to `end`.
