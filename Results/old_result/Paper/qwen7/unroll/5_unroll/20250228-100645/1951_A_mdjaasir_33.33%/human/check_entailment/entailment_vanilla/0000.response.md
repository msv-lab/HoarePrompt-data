### Reasoning:

The provided program `func()` does not relate to the problem described in the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. The `func()` function reads input from the user and checks a binary string for certain conditions, while the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function generates additional files based on directories containing `.html` files within a specified range.

Since the question asks to determine the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function based on its problem description, we should focus only on that function.

### Analysis of `generate_files_for_html_in_range` Function:

1. **Directory Scanning**: The function correctly scans the current directory for subdirectories.
2. **Folder Name Validation**: It checks if the folder name is a digit and falls within the specified range.
3. **HTML File Detection**: It lists all `.html` files within the valid folders.
4. **File Generation**: For each `.html` file found, it generates two new files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) within the same folder and prints their paths.

Given the problem description, the provided code appears to be correct and performs the intended operations without any apparent errors.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**

The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description.
