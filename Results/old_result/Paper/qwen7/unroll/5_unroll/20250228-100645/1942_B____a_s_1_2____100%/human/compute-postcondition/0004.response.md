Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the array), and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a`, where each element `p[i]` is determined as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[i]` during each iteration. Finally, it prints the resulting permutation `p` for each test case.**
