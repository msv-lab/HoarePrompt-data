You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (size of the array), and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a valid permutation `p` for the given array `a`, where each element `p[i]` is determined as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[i]` during each iteration. Finally, it prints the resulting permutation `p` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to construct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The function needs to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution initializes a list `p` with `-1` values.
   - It iterates through the array `a` in reverse order.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates \( p[i] \) as \( \texttt{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It updates the `mex` value to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the calculated \( p[i] \).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic seems to be attempting to construct the permutation by ensuring that the MEX condition holds for each position.
   - However, the key issue lies in how the `mex` value is being updated and used. Specifically, the update of `mex` might not correctly reflect the MEX value for the subsequent positions in the permutation.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input: `n = 3`, `a = [1, 1, 1]`.
   - According to the problem, the MEX of an empty set is 0, so \( p_1 \) should be 0.
   - Then, \( a_1 = \texttt{MEX}([0]) - 0 = 1 \), which is correct.
   - For \( p_2 \), the MEX of `[0, x]` should be 1 (since 0 is already used), so \( p_2 \) should be 0.
   - But the code would calculate \( p_2 \) as \( \texttt{mex} - a[1] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve maintaining a separate list to track the used indices and calculating the MEX dynamically for each position.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle the calculation of the MEX value and the construction of the permutation. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
