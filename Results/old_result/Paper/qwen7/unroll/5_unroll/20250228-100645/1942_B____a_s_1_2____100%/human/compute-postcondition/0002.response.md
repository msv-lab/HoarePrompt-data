Output State: **After executing the loop for `t` times, the variable `p` will contain an array of integers for each iteration, where each element `p[i]` is calculated as `mex - a[i]` and `mex` is updated to be the minimum of itself and `p[i]` during each iteration. The final state of `p` for each iteration is printed.**
