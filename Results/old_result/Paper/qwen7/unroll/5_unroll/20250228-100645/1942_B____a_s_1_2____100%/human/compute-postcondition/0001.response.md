Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: According to the problem statement, `t` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user, and this integer is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is initialized to a positive integer, the loop will execute `t` times.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is greater than 0. Given that `t` is a positive integer, it will always be greater than 0, but we need to explicitly state this condition.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned to remain unchanged from their initial state, so no adjustments are needed for these variables.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
