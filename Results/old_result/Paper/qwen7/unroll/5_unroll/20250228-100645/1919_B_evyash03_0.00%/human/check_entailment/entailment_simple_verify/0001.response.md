### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation. Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to verify this conclusion.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using the character `'-'` as a delimiter.
   - This means each part is a contiguous segment of `+` characters separated by `'-'`.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - The variable `result_length` is set to the sum of the lengths of these parts.
   - This is a placeholder for the actual calculation of the minimum penalty, which is not used in the current implementation.

4. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the `expression` and `result_length` as arguments.
   - However, the `result_length` parameter is not used within the function, which suggests it might be a mistake or an unused variable.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` counter to keep track of the net sum of `+` and `-` characters.
   - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets the `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus one if the `balance` is positive at the end.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Understanding
- The goal is to minimize the penalty, which is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the segments multiplied by their lengths.
- The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero or as close to zero as possible.

#### Function `func_1`
- The function counts the number of segments where the sum is negative and adds one if the final balance is positive.
- This approach does not account for the actual penalty calculation, which involves the absolute value of the sum and the length of the segment.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `+`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: The array is `[1]`, and the penalty is `1`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `-----`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`, and splitting into `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])` gives a penalty of `5`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `+-+-+-`
  - Output: `0`
  - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, and splitting into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])` gives a penalty of `0`.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `--+++++++-`
  - Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The array is `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`, and splitting into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])` gives a penalty of `4`.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
  - Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The array is `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`, and splitting into `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])` gives a penalty of `4`.

### Conclusion

Upon re-evaluation, the function `func_1` indeed does not correctly implement the penalty calculation. It only counts the number of segments where the sum is negative and adds one if the final balance is positive, which is not the correct approach. The function should calculate the actual penalty by considering the absolute value of the sum of each segment and multiplying it by the length of the segment.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
