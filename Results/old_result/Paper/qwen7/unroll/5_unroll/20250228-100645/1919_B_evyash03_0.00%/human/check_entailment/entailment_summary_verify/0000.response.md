### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
- The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    parts = expression.split('-')
    result_length = sum((len(part) for part in parts))
    print(func_1(expression, result_length))

def func_1(expression, length):
    count = 0
    balance = 0
    for char in expression:
        if char == '+':
            balance += 1
        elif char == '-':
            balance -= 1
        if balance < 0:
            count += 1
            balance = 0
    return count + (balance > 0)
```

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` counts the number of times the balance (initially set to 0) goes negative while iterating through each character in `expression`.
- If the balance is positive at the end, it adds 1 to the count.
- The function returns this count.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is counting the number of times the balance goes negative, which is not directly related to the penalty calculation. The function summary does not accurately describe the intended behavior for the problem.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The program splits the string `expression` into parts based on the '-' character and then calls `func_1` with the length of the concatenated parts. However, `func_1` does not actually compute the penalty; it only counts the number of times the balance goes negative.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The problem requires finding an optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The current implementation does not address this requirement.
4. **Example Test Case**: Consider the input `10 --+++++++-`. The expected output is `4`, but the program would incorrectly output `1` because `func_1` is not performing the required penalty calculation.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to find the minimum possible penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.
