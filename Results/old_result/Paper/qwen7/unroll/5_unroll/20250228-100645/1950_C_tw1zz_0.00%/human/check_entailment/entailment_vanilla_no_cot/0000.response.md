Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program can be optimized and simplified. The current implementation uses multiple `if-elif` statements to convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format, which is inefficient and redundant. A more concise way to achieve this conversion is by using modulo arithmetic and conditional statements. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (h, m) = map(str, input().split(':'))
        h1 = str((int(h) % 12) or 12)  # Convert 24-hour format to 12-hour format
        time = 'AM' if int(h) < 12 else 'PM'
        print(f'{h1}:{m} {time}')


func()
```

This version correctly handles the conversion and prints the time in the required format without unnecessary complexity.
