The function processes multiple time inputs in the 24-hour format and converts them to the 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of time inputs to process, followed by `t` lines of time inputs in the format "hh:mm". For each input, it converts the hour part to the 12-hour format and appends the appropriate AM/PM designation, then prints the converted time. The final state consists of `t` lines of output, each displaying a time in the format "h1:mm AM/PM".
