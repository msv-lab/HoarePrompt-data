The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and a list of `n` integers `array`. It then calls `func_1` to compute the maximum beauty of the array and stores the result. After processing all test cases, it prints the computed maximum beauty for each test case.
