Output State: **`t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[0])` assigns the integer value of `data[0]` to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
