Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented and serve the purpose of the problem description.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1(a, b)` returns the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
- This function is used to compute a least common multiple (LCM) type operation, but it's not directly related to solving the problem at hand. The problem requires distributing coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function `func_2(numbers)` computes the LCM of a list of numbers using the `func_1` function.
- While computing the LCM is useful in some contexts, it doesn't help in solving the current problem either. The problem needs to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

### Problem Requirements:
- We need to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
- The solution should involve finding a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i
  \]
  where \(k_i\) is the multiplier for the \(i\)-th outcome.

### Correct Approach:
- For each outcome \(i\), we need to find an \(x_i\) such that:
  \[
  x_i < k_i \cdot x_i
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \implies x_i (1 - k_i) < 0
  \]
  Since \(k_i \geq 2\), \(1 - k_i < 0\), so the inequality holds for any positive \(x_i\). Therefore, we can choose \(x_i = 1\) for all \(i\) and check if the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.

### Conclusion:
- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not contribute to solving the problem as described. Instead, a simple approach of setting \(x_i = 1\) for all \(i\) and checking if the total bet is less than the winnings for each outcome would suffice.
- Given the problem constraints and the example outputs, the provided functions are not necessary and do not contribute to the correct solution.

Correctness: **False**
