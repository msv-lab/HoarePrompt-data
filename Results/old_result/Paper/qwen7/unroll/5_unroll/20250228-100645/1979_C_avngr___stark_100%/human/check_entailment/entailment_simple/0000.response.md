### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. 

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD). This function ensures that the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of all numbers in the list `numbers`. This is achieved by iteratively applying `func_1` to pairs of numbers in the list.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the LCM of all multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the total bet is equal to the LCM value.
   - If the total bet is not less than the LCM value, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the distribution of coins.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for calculating the LCM is correct and consistent with the problem requirements.
   - The distribution of coins is calculated correctly as the LCM of all multipliers.
   - The condition check (`sum(c) >= m`) ensures that the total bet is not sufficient to win back the required amount, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
