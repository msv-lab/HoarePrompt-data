Output State: **result is the product of all elements in numbers.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in the `numbers` list starting from the second element. In each iteration, it updates `result` by calling `func_1(result, num)`, which implies some form of multiplication (since no other operation is specified). Therefore, the final value of `result` will be the product of all elements in the `numbers` list.
