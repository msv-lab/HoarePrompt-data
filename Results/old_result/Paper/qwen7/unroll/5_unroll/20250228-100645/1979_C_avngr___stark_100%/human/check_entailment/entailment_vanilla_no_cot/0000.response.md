Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem at hand. The problem requires distributing bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. The given functions seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, which is not what the problem requires.

To solve this problem, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the payout for any outcome. Given the constraints, a simple approach would be to bet a fixed amount on each outcome and ensure that the total bet is less than the minimum payout. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def distribute_bets(n, multipliers):
    # Find the minimum multiplier
    min_multiplier = min(multipliers)
    
    # Bet a fixed amount on each outcome
    # We can bet 1 coin on each outcome and check if it works
    bet_amount = 1
    total_bet = bet_amount * n
    
    # Check if the total bet is less than the minimum payout
    if total_bet < min_multiplier:
        return [bet_amount] * n
    else:
        return [-1]

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    multipliers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = distribute_bets(n, multipliers)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
```

This solution checks if betting 1 coin on each outcome results in a total bet that is less than the minimum payout. If it does, it returns the distribution; otherwise, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the conditions of the problem are met.
