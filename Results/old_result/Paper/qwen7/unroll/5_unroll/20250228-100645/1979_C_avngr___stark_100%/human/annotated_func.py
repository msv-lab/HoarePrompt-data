#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i in the range of n, and gcd(a, b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, and returns the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their gcd.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where 1 <= len(numbers) <= 50, and each element k_i in numbers satisfies 2 <= k_i <= 20.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: result is the product of all elements in numbers.
    return result
    #The program returns the product of all elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers named 'numbers' and returns the product of all elements in the list. After processing, the program state includes a single variable 'result' which holds the product of all integers in the input list 'numbers'.
