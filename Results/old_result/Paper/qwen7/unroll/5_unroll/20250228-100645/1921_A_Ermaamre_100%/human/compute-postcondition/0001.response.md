Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable, which is typically used when the value of the iterator is not needed within the loop body.
   - The loop also uses `t` as the range parameter.

2. Determine the conditions for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer.

3. Adjust the state based on these conditions:
   - The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied since `t` is between 1 and 100.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is a positive integer, which it already is according to the given initial state.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
