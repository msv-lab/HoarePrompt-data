You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50,000). For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then computes a specific value based on these inputs using a loop, which involves modifying \( n \) and \( k \) according to certain conditions. Finally, it prints the computed value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read as the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `t` times, processing each test case.

2. **Reading Test Case Input**:
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are read. Here, `n` is the total number of cards, and `k` is the position of the card we need to find.

3. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `s` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `m` is initialized to 1. This variable will be used to calculate the position of the card based on the current multiplier.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
   - `x` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`. This represents the number of odd-numbered cards at the current multiplier level.
   - `n` is halved (`n //= 2`). This moves to the next multiplier level.
   - If `k` falls within the range `[s, s + x]`, the loop breaks, indicating that the current multiplier level is where the `k`-th card lies.
   - Otherwise, `s` is updated by adding `x`, and `m` is doubled (`m *= 2`).

5. **Calculating the Card Position**:
   - After exiting the loop, the position of the card is calculated using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
   - This formula correctly maps the relative position `k - s` to the actual card number at the current multiplier level.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 1`
   - First, all odd cards: 1, 3, 5, 7.
   - Second, all cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6.
   - Third, all cards that are four times an odd number: 4.
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 1st card is 1.

2. **Example 2**: `n = 7`, `k = 2`
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 2nd card is 3.

3. **Example 3**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 3rd card is 5.

4. **Example 4**: `n = 7`, `k = 4`
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 4th card is 7.

5. **Example 5**: `n = 7`, `k = 5`
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 5th card is 2.

6. **Example 6**: `n = 7`, `k = 6`
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 6th card is 6.

7. **Example 7**: `n = 7`, `k = 7`
   - The sequence is 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.
   - The 7th card is 4.

8. **Example 8**: `n = 1`, `k = 1`
   - Only one card: 1.
   - The 1st card is 1.

9. **Example 9**: `n = 34`, `k = 14`
   - The sequence is constructed similarly, and the 14th card is 27.

10. **Example 10**: `n = 84`, `k = 19`
    - The sequence is constructed similarly, and the 19th card is 37.

11. **Example 11**: `n = 1000000000`, `k = 1000000000`
    - The sequence is constructed similarly, and the 1000000000th card is \(536870912\).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the `k`-th card laid down according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
