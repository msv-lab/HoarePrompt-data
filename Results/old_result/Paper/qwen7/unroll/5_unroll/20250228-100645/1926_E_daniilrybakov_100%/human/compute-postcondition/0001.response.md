State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` from the `range(t)` function.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4).
- The initial state of `t` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4 ensures that the loop can execute.
- No other variables or states need to be adjusted since the only relevant variable for the loop's execution is `t`.
