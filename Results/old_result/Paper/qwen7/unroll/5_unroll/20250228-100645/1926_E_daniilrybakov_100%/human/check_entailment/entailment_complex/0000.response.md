Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the \( k \)-th card that Vladislav lays down based on a specific sequence rule.
2. The annotated program correctly captures the essence of the problem and the sequence generation logic.
3. The key steps in the program are:
   - Reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, reading \( n \) and \( k \).
   - Using a loop to iteratively reduce \( n \) and adjust \( k \) based on the number of cards added at each step.
   - The formula \((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m\) correctly computes the \( k \)-th card based on the current state of \( s \) and \( m \).

Given the detailed explanation and the correct implementation of the logic, the program accurately computes the required output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
