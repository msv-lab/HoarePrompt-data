Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*' characters, where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The variable `ret` is the number of coins collected before encountering two consecutive thorns ('*'), and it is printed at the end of each test case. If two thorns are encountered consecutively, no more cells are processed.
