The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It modifies the list according to specific rules within a loop. For each index i from 1 to n-2, if the element at index i is greater than 1 and the elements at indices i-1 and i+1 are greater than 0, it decreases the element at index i by twice the value of the element at index i-1, decreases the element at index i+1 by the value of the element at index i-1, and decreases the element at index i-1 by itself (effectively halving it). If at any point the element at index i-1 is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', it calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is the result of all the operations performed within the loop.
