Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic of both `func_1` and `func_2` and ensure they collectively meet the problem requirements.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to check if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations allow us to reduce three consecutive elements in a specific pattern.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the specified operations on the list.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index i, if `list[i] > 1` and `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` becomes zero before completing the iteration, it prints 'no' and returns.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Verification**:
   - The operations in `func_2` are designed to reduce the elements in a way that can eventually lead to all elements being zero if it's possible.
   - The condition checking in `func_2` ensures that the operations are applied correctly and stops early if it's impossible to proceed.
   - `func_1` correctly checks if all elements are zero after the operations.

Given the logical flow and the operations, the program should correctly determine if it's possible to make all elements zero based on the problem statement. Therefore, the program is logically sound and meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
