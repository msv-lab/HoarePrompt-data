Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros properly. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`. According to the problem description, we can perform the operation on index `i` (where `2 <= i <= n-1`) to reduce the array elements as follows:

1. Apply the operation at `i=3`:
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 1 = 3`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 2 = 2`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 1 = 4`
   - Resulting array: `[2, 3, 2, 4, 1]`

2. Apply the operation at `i=3` again:
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 1 = 2`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 2 = 0`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 1 = 3`
   - Resulting array: `[2, 2, 0, 3, 1]`

3. Apply the operation at `i=2`:
   - `a_1 = a_1 - 1 = 1`
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 2 = 0`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 0`
   - Resulting array: `[1, 0, 0, 3, 1]`

4. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 0`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 2 = 1`
   - `a_5 = a_5 - 1 = 0`
   - Resulting array: `[1, 0, 0, 1, 0]`

5. Apply the operation at `i=3`:
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 1 = 0`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 2 = 0`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 1 = 0`
   - Resulting array: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

However, the provided program incorrectly handles this scenario. After performing the operations, the program checks if all elements are zero using `func_1`, which returns `False` because `a_1` is still `1`. Therefore, it prints `NO`, which is incorrect based on the steps shown above.

Since the program does not correctly handle this case, the correctness is **False**.
