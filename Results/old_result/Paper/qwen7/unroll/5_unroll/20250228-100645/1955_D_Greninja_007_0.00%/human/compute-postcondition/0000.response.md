Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, k, n, and m are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and 1 <= n, m, k <= 2 * 10^5.**

Explanation: The line `good_subarrays = 0` initializes the variable `good_subarrays` to 0. No changes are made to the lists `a` and `b`, nor to the integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
