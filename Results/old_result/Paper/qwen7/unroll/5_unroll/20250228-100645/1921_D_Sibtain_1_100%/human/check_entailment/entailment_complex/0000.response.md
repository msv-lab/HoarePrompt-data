Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the list `a`, and the list `b`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the edge case where both lists `a` and `b` contain the same element repeated throughout (`if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and a[0] == c[0]:`). In this case, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case, which is correct.

3. **Sorting Lists**: The function sorts list `a` in ascending order and list `c` in descending order. This is a key step because it ensures that the maximum difference is achieved by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `c`.

4. **Calculation of Maximum Differences**: The function iterates through the sorted lists, calculating the maximum absolute difference between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`. It accumulates these differences in the variable `ans`. This logic is sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the total difference.

5. **Output**: The function prints the accumulated value of `ans` for each test case, which is the desired output.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
