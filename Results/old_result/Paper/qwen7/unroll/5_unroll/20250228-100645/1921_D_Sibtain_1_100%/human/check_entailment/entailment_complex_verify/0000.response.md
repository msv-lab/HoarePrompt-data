### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided solution step-by-step to determine if it correctly maximizes the total difference \(D\).

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - The solution first checks if both arrays `a` and `c` contain identical and constant values. If they do, it prints `0`. This check is correct and necessary to handle the trivial case where no difference can be achieved.

2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - The arrays `a` and `c` are sorted in ascending and descending order, respectively. This step is intended to facilitate the calculation of the maximum differences. Sorting helps in pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This is a common heuristic to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

3. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - The solution uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the sorted arrays `a` and `c`, respectively. It calculates the maximum difference between the current elements pointed by `i` and `j` and accumulates these differences into `ans`.
   - The logic inside the loop ensures that the larger difference is always added to `ans` by choosing the maximum of `t1` and `t2`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the length of `a` is 1 separately. In this case, it simply calculates the maximum difference between the single element in `a` and the maximum and minimum elements in `c`.

Given the above steps, let's re-evaluate the provided solution against the original assessment:

- The original assessment states that the solution does not always maximize the total difference \(D\). It provides a counterexample:
  ```
  4 6
  1 2 3 4
  8 7 5 8 2 10
  ```
  - The expected output is 23, but the actual output is 15.

- The solution's approach of sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order is a reasonable heuristic to maximize the differences. However, it does not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases. The counterexample provided shows that the solution fails to consider all possible permutations of assignments to achieve the maximum difference.

- The solution does not explicitly consider all permutations of assignments from `c` to `a` to ensure the maximum difference. It relies on the sorting heuristic, which may not always yield the optimal result.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution, while attempting to maximize the total difference, does not guarantee the optimal solution in all cases due to its reliance on a heuristic rather than an exhaustive search. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
