The function processes multiple test cases, each involving integers n and m, along with two lists a and c. It first checks if the values in lists a and c are identical and constant across all elements. If so, it prints 0 and skips further processing. Otherwise, it sorts lists a in ascending order and c in descending order. Then, it calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements of the sorted lists a and c, printing the total sum for each test case.
