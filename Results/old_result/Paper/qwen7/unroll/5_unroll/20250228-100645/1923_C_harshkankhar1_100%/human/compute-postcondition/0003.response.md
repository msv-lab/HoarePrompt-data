Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`, and `1` (the starting value of the range).

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` starts from `1` and goes up to `n + 1`.
   - The variable `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start, but since it is given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5`, we can assume `n` is already within this range.
   - The starting value of `i` is `1`.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from `1`, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - The value of `n` must be at least `1` for the loop to start, but it is given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5`, so no adjustment is needed for `n`.
   - The initial value of `i` should be set to `1`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5**
