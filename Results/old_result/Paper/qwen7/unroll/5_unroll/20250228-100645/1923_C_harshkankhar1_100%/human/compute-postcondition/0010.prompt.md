You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; the array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n; the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, the array `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, the list `a` is `[0]` followed by integers split from input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the list `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is equal to the number of times an integer greater than 1 appears before index i in list `a`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each query based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] >= b[y] - b[x - 1]` and `x != y`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after the loop executes all the iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter t, which is a positive integer. For each test case, it accepts parameters n and q, both positive integers where 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5. It also accepts an array c, which is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, for each query, it accepts parameters l_i and r_i, which are integers where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on the queries, ensuring that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
