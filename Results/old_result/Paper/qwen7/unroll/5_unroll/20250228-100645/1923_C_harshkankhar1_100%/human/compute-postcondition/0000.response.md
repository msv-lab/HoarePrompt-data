Output State: **t is a positive integer, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, the array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5, the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5; n and q are assigned the values from input split by spaces.**

In this state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was a positive integer in the initial state. The values of `n` and `q` are now assigned the values from the input split by spaces, which are converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The conditions and constraints on `n`, `q`, `c`, and the queries remain the same.
