Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers n and q, an array c of n positive integers, and q queries. For each query, it compares the sum of elements in the array c from index l to r with the count of elements greater than 1 in the same range. If the sum is greater than or equal to the count and l is not equal to r, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not modify the input arrays c, a, and b, and it does not return any value.**
