Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5, the array `c` is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, the list `a` is `[0]` followed by integers split from input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `a` with a leading zero followed by integers obtained from the input. These integers are converted to integers using `int(x)` for each `x` in the input, which is split by spaces. The values of `t`, `n`, and `q` remain unchanged from their initial state.
