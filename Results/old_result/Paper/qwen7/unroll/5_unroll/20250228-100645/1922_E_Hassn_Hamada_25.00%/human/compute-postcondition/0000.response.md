Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence.**

The code defines a function without executing it, so no variables are updated or returned. The function itself is described in the docstring, indicating that it takes an input number and generates a sequence based on it, returning the size of the generated sequence. The initial conditions for `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged.
