Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
3. It calculates the number of fireworks from each installation that would be visible at any given time using the formula `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that the last firework from each installation will overlap with the first firework of the next cycle.
4. The calculation `m // a + m // b + 2` is correct because:
   - `m // a` gives the number of fireworks from the first installation that would be visible within the time frame.
   - `m // b` gives the number of fireworks from the second installation that would be visible within the time frame.
   - Adding 2 accounts for the overlap of the last firework from the first installation and the first firework from the second installation.
5. The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct.

Correctness: **True**
