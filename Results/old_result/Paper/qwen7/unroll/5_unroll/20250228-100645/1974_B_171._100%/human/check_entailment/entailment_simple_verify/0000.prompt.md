You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is a unique character from `unique_chars` mapped to the corresponding character from the end of the list towards the start.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for every potential case:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to extract the number of test cases, the length of each encoded string, and the encoded strings themselves.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - It first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically to form the auxiliary string `r`.
   - It creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character.
   - It uses this mapping to decode the entire encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles strings of varying lengths and ensures that the decoding process works correctly regardless of the length of the encoded string.
   - The sorting and mapping steps ensure that the decoding is done accurately, even for edge cases like single-character strings or strings with repeated characters.

4. **Consistency**:
   - The program consistently applies the same logic across all test cases, ensuring that the decoding process is uniform and correct.

Given that the program correctly implements the decoding logic and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
