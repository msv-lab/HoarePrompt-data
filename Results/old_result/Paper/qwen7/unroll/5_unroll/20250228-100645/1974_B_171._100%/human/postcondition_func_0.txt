The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. This is achieved by creating a mapping of each unique character in `encoded` to another character, specifically the one positioned at the opposite end of the sorted unique character list. The `decoded` string is then generated by applying this reverse mapping to each character in the original `encoded` string.
