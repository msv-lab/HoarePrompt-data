Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop**: The loop `while n:` will execute as long as `n` is non-zero.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each value of `l`, and the result is printed.

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute the first time**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is described as an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` must be non-zero**
