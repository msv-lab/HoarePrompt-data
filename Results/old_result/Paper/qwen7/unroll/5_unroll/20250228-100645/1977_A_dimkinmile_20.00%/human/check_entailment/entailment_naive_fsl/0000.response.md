Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the number of moves `n` is less than the final number of cubes `m`. According to the problem description, Nikita can either add or remove exactly one cube per move. Therefore, it is impossible to have more cubes (`m`) after `n` moves if `n` is less than `m`. However, the current implementation prints "Yes" for such cases, which is incorrect. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" because it only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` without considering the nature of the operations (adding or removing one cube per move).
