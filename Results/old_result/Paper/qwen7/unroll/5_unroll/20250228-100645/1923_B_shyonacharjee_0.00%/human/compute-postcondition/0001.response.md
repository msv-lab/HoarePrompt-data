State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is used as a counter in the loop and is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
2. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute, and the loop counter `_` is set to 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, `_` is 0**.
