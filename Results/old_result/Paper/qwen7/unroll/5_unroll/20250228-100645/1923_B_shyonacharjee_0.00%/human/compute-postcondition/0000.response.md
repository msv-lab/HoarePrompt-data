Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the list x contains n integers such that -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other conditions and lists remain unchanged.
