Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the conditions used to determine whether the digits form a "PEAK". Specifically, the current logic incorrectly handles cases where `b` is the maximum value but `a` and `c` do not satisfy the peak condition (`a < b > c`). The correct conditions should be:

- For a "STAIR": `a < b < c`
- For a "PEAK": `a < b > c`
- Otherwise, it's "NONE"

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This corrected version correctly identifies whether the digits form a "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" based on the given conditions.
