Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through variables t, n, m, k, a_i, b_i, and f_i, where t is an integer between 1 and 50000 inclusive. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers with specific ranges, and a_i, b_i, and f_i are also integers with given constraints. The function returns information based on these inputs, though the exact return value is not specified in the provided output cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each defined by the variables t, n, m, k, a_i, b_i, and f_i, and process them according to their specified constraints, but without specifying what exactly the function returns, only that it processes these inputs.
