### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \(k\) pairs chosen for the excursions.
- Each pair of friends has a friendship value which increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen again.
- The expected value should be calculated considering the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship value over subsequent excursions.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   M = 10 ** 9 + 7
   c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
   s = 0
   a = 0
   ```
   - `M` is the modulus.
   - `c` is the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `s` is initialized to 0, representing the sum of expected values.
   - `a` is initialized to 0, representing the sum of initial friendship values.

2. **Reading Input and Calculating Initial Sum**:
   ```python
   for i in range(m):
       u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
       a += f
   ```
   - This loop reads the friendship values and sums them up in `a`.

3. **Calculating Expected Value**:
   ```python
   for i in range(k):
       s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
   ```
   - Here, the program attempts to update `s` using the formula \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).

#### Issues with the Program:
1. **Probability Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly uses the modular inverse `c` without properly accounting for the probability of choosing each pair. The probability of choosing a specific pair in each excursion should be considered, and the expected value should be calculated accordingly.
   
2. **Summation of Friendship Values**:
   - The program sums the initial friendship values `a` but does not correctly incorporate the probability of choosing each pair in each excursion. The expected value should take into account the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship value over subsequent excursions.
   
3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value should be calculated using the formula for the expected value of a random variable. In this case, the expected value for each pair should be the sum of the probabilities of choosing each pair multiplied by their respective friendship values increased by the number of times they are chosen.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the probability of choosing each pair and the increase in friendship values over subsequent excursions.
