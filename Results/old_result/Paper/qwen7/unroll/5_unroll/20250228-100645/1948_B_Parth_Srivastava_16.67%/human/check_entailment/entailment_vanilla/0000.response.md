Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` but does not pass any arguments to it.
   - This means `func_1()` will be called `m` times without any input, which is incorrect because `func_1()` expects input parameters.

3. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - Reads the size of the array `k`.
   - Reads the array elements as a string and converts them to integers.
   - Initializes variables `x`, `y`, `n`, and `c` to manage the transformation process.
   - Iterates through the array elements and performs the transformation logic:
     - If an element is greater than 10, it splits the element into its digits and checks if the new digit can be added to the list `c` while maintaining the non-decreasing order.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it simply adds it to the list `c`.
   - Sorts the list `c` and checks if it is sorted.
   - Appends `1` to `b` if the transformed list `c` is sorted, otherwise appends `0`.

4. **Printing Results:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

### Issues Identified:
- The main loop `for i in range(m): func_1()` should pass the test case index `i` to `func_1()`, but it does not.
- The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, which leads to incorrect behavior.
- The logic in `func_1()` seems correct for transforming the array and checking if it can be sorted, but it needs to be called correctly with the appropriate test case data.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to modify the main loop to pass the test case index to `func_1()` and ensure it processes the correct input for each test case.

```python
m = int(input())
b = []
for i in range(m):
    func_1(i)

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1(test_case_index):
    k = int(input())
    a = input().strip()
    a = list(map(int, a.split()))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] // 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

### Conclusion:
After making the necessary corrections, the program should now work correctly. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the lack of proper parameter passing to `func_1()`. The corrected version would be correct.

Correctness: **False**
