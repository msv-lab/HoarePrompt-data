Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Initialization of `b` List**: The list `b` is not initialized before use. This will lead to undefined behavior when checking its values.
2. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The program reads all inputs for the test cases but only processes one test case per iteration of the loop. This means it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
3. **Logic in `func_1` Function**: The logic in `func_1` function to split and reinsert digits is mostly correct but could be optimized. However, the main issue is how it handles the sorting and comparison with the original array.
4. **Output Logic**: The output logic should check the result of processing each test case individually rather than using a separate list `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
m = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(m):
    k = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Process each element in the array
    for i in range(len(a)):
        while a[i] >= 10:
            digit = a[i] % 10
            a[i] //= 10
            a.insert(i + 1, digit)
    
    # Check if the array is sorted
    if a == sorted(a):
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')

# Output the results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version initializes the necessary variables correctly, processes each test case independently, and outputs the results accurately.
