### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several critical issues in the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The main loop `for i in range(m): func_1()` does not pass any parameters to `func_1()`, which is expected to receive the test case index `i`. This leads to incorrect behavior since `func_1()` is not processing the correct input for each test case.

2. **Logic and Implementation**: The logic within `func_1()` appears to be correct for transforming the array and checking if it can be sorted. However, the issue lies in how `func_1()` is being called, which is not passing the necessary test case data.

3. **Corrected Program**: The suggested correction involves modifying the main loop to pass the test case index `i` to `func_1()`, ensuring that `func_1()` processes the correct input for each test case.

Given these points, the original program is indeed incorrect due to the lack of proper parameter passing to `func_1()`. The corrected version provided in the assessment addresses this issue and should work correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect, and the provided corrected version should be used instead.
