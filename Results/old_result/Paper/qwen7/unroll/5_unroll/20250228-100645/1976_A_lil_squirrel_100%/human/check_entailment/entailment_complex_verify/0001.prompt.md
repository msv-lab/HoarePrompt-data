You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`. The list `letters` is already sorted.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`. The list `digits` is already sorted.
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, and `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`. The list `digits` is already sorted, and the loop has executed all iterations without finding any alphabetic character followed immediately by a digit.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the characters in `password` into two lists: one for letters and one for digits. The function then checks if both lists are sorted and ensures there are no alphabetic characters followed immediately by digits. If these conditions are met, the function returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to check if a given password meets specific criteria.
   - The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - There should be no digit immediately following a letter.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the password length (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then separates the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks the sorting of both `letters` and `digits` lists.
   - It correctly identifies invalid sequences where a digit follows a letter.
   - The logic flow is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles empty strings and strings with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It correctly handles strings with mixed letters and digits.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.
