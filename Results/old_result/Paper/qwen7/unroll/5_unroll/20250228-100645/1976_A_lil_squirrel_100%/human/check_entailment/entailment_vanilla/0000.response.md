### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to check if a given password meets specific criteria.
   - The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - There should be no digit immediately following a letter.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the password length (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then separates the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks the sorting of both `letters` and `digits` lists.
   - It correctly identifies invalid sequences where a digit follows a letter.
   - The logic flow is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles empty strings and strings with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It correctly handles strings with mixed letters and digits.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
