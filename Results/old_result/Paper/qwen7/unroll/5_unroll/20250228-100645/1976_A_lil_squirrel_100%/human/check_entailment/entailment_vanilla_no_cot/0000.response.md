Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Separation of Characters**: The program correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits`.
2. **Sorting Check**: It checks if both `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **Order Validation**: It ensures that there are no digits coming after letters by iterating through the password and checking the sequence.
4. **Output**: Based on the validation, it prints "YES" if the password is strong and "NO" otherwise.

Given the problem statement and the example test cases, the provided solution accurately determines whether a password is strong according to the defined rules.
