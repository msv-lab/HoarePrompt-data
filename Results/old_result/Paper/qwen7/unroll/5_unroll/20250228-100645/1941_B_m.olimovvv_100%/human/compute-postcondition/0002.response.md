Output State: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. The array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j, and after executing the loop, if the conditions inside the loop are met for all elements, the last two elements of the array b are 0, otherwise, 'NO' is printed at some point during the loop execution. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
