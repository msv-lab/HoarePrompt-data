Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly identifies the conditions under which it is impossible to make all squares in the grid the same color:
   - If the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), it means that there is no way to change the color of the squares in the middle rows without leaving some squares in the opposite color.
   - Similarly, if every row is identical and contains only one type of character but the first row is different from the last row, it also means that the colors cannot be made uniform across the entire grid.
2. The program correctly handles the input and checks the required conditions for each test case.
3. The logic implemented in the program matches the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
