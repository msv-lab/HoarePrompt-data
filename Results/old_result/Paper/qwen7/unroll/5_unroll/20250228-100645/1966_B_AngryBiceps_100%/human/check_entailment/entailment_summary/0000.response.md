Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color through a series of operations.
2. The provided solution checks two specific conditions:
   - Whether the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or
   - Whether every row is identical and contains only one type of character but the first row is different from the last row.
3. If either of these conditions is met, the function prints 'NO', indicating that it is not possible to make all squares the same color.
4. Otherwise, the function prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible.
5. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of making all squares the same color through a series of operations that involve selecting subrectangles. The conditions checked are too restrictive and do not cover all possible scenarios where the grid can be made uniform.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution is incorrect because it fails to account for the full range of operations allowed by the problem statement. Specifically, it incorrectly assumes that the grid can only be uniform if the first and last rows meet certain criteria, which is not always true.
