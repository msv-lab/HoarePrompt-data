Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if every row is identical and contains only one type of character ('W' or 'B') but the first row is different from the last row, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
