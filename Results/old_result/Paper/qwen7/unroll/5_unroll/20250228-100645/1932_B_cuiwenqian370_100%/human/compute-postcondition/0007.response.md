Output State: `index` is 2 + 2T, `T` is an integer from data at index 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is a list containing T elements, each element being the final `last_year` value for each iteration of the loop.
