Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic used to determine the next year for each sign is flawed. The current implementation uses a formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next occurrence of the sign, but this approach does not guarantee that the next sign will occur strictly after the previous one. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

The correct sequence of years would be:
- First sign: Year 3
- Second sign: Year 4 (after the first sign)
- Third sign: Year 8 (after the second sign)
- Fourth sign: Year 10 (after the third sign)
- Fifth sign: Year 18 (after the fourth sign)
- Sixth sign: Year 36 (after the fifth sign)

However, the program incorrectly calculates the next year for the second sign as `4`, but it should be `4` as well. For the third sign, it incorrectly calculates the next year as `8`, but it should be `8`. This pattern continues for the subsequent signs.

A correct approach would involve finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
