Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case as per the problem statement.
- It initializes the necessary variables and iterates through each test case, calculating the year when the nth sign will occur.
- The logic inside the loop is correct. For each sign, it calculates the next occurrence year by ensuring it is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence year.
- The final results are stored in a list and written to stdout in the correct format.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
