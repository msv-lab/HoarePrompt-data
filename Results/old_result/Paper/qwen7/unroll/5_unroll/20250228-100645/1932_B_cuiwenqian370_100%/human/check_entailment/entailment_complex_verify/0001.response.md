### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over these strings to process each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculation of Next Year**:
   - The loop calculates the next year when the next sign will occur. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
   - However, the formula can be simplified to just `((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]`, which is more intuitive and avoids unnecessary additions and subtractions.

4. **Appending Results**:
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list as a string representation of the final year.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the results in the required format by joining the results list with newlines.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `T` is read from the input and represents the number of test cases.
  - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.

- **First Test Case**:
  - `n` is read and represents the number of signs for the current test case.
  - `a` is read and represents the periodicities of the signs.
  - `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.
  - The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` to calculate the next year for each subsequent sign.
    - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the next year.
    - This formula is correct but can be simplified to `((last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i]) * a[i]`.

- **Subsequent Test Cases**:
  - The same process is repeated for each test case, updating `last_year` and appending the result to `results`.

- **Final State**:
  - After processing all test cases, the results are joined with newlines and written to standard output.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The simplification of the formula does not change the correctness of the program, but it makes the code more readable.

### Final:
**True**
