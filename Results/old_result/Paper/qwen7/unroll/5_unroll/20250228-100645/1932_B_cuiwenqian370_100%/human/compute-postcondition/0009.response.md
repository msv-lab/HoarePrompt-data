Output State: **`index` is 2 + 2T, `T` is an integer from data at index 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is a list of T strings, each string being the result of the last year's value after processing for each T iteration, and the results are printed to stdout.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output (stdout), with each element separated by a newline character. This does not change the values of any variables other than potentially printing their current state to the console. Therefore, the values of `index`, `T`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`, and `results` remain unchanged, but the `results` list is now printed to the console.
