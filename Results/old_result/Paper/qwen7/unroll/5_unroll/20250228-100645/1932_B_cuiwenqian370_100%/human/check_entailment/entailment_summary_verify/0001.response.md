### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over these strings to process each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculation of Next Year**:
   - The loop calculates the next year when the next sign will occur using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
   - However, this formula can be simplified and potentially optimized. The expression `(last_year + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` achieves the same purpose but is more readable and avoids unnecessary additions.

4. **Appending Results**:
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list as a string representation of the final year.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the results in the required format by joining the results list with newlines.

### Analysis of the Formula:
The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` simplifies to `(last_year + a[i]) // a[i] * a[i]`, which is more straightforward and avoids the extra `-1` and `+1` operations. This simplification does not change the correctness but improves readability and efficiency.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the logical soundness and correctness of the program. The formula used in the program is indeed correct, and the overall implementation matches the problem description accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct and implements the logic as described in the problem statement.
