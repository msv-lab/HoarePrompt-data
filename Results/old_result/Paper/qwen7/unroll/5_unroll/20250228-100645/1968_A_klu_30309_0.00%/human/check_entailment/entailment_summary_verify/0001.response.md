### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the given function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the integer `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2` (since `y` must be less than `x`).
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `y` is a divisor of `x` and \(2 \cdot y \geq x\), it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - If no such `y` is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the constraints), it returns the last valid `y` found (`max_val`).

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(x)` for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1`. Since \(2 \cdot 1 < 2\), the function should return `1`.
  - For `x = 3`, the possible `y` values are `1` and `2`. Since \(2 \cdot 2 \geq 3\), the function should return `2`.
  - For larger values of `x`, the function correctly identifies the largest `y` that divides `x` and satisfies \(2 \cdot y \geq x\).

- **General Case:**
  - The function iterates backwards from `x-1` to `2`, ensuring it finds the largest possible `y` that meets the criteria.
  - The check `2 * y >= x` ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the function summary states that the function always returns `1` if no such `y` exists. This is not consistent with the problem description and the expected behavior of the function.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function Behavior:**
  - The function iterates from `x-1` to `2` and checks if `y` is a divisor of `x` and if `2 * y >= x`.
  - If no such `y` is found, it returns `max_val`, which is set to `1` initially.

- **Problem Description:**
  - The problem requires finding any `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
  - The function should return the largest `y` that satisfies the condition, not necessarily `1`.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. It always returns `1` if no suitable `y` is found, which is not the intended behavior. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
