Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, who take turns placing cards on a table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of cards each player gets) and the list of numbers on your cards.
   - It calls a function `func_1` to calculate your maximum possible score.
   - The function `func_1` counts how many pairs of cards (with the same number) you have.
   - It returns the count of such pairs, which is the maximum number of points you can get because each pair allows you to score a point.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not fully capture the optimal strategy for maximizing your score. Specifically, it only checks for pairs and does not consider the optimal placement of cards by Nene.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It correctly processes each test case and outputs the result for each.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not account for the fact that Nene will play optimally to minimize your score. For example, if you have a pair of cards with the same number, Nene can strategically place cards to prevent you from scoring points.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that `func_1` returns the count of integers from 1 to `n` that appear exactly twice in the list. This is true, but it does not reflect the optimal strategy for maximizing your score.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get based on the given constraints and rules. The function `func_1` only counts pairs of cards, but it does not account for the optimal strategy of Nene.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
