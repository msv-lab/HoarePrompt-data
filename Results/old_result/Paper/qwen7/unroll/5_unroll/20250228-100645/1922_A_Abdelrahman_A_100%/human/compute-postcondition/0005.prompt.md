You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), it checks if the third string `c` contains any character that is not present in either of the strings `a` or `b`. If `c` contains any such character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if `c` matches exactly with either `a` or `b`, and if so, it prints 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. The final output state will be a list of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function returns a specific value or message based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
