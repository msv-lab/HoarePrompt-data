Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects the number of test cases `t` but does not handle it properly. It directly reads the number of elements `n` without considering the number of test cases.
2. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation logic is flawed. The variable `s` is reset to 0 for every test case within the loop, which means it will not accumulate scores across different test cases.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the score for each test case inside the loop, which means all scores are printed together at the end instead of being grouped by test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []

    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        numbers.sort()
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)

    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases, calculates the score correctly, and outputs the results in the required format.
