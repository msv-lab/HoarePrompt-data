Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `n = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is set to the input received, which is constrained to be between 1 and 50. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000 is preserved, and the new constraint on `n` is added.
