Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty as the sum of differences between pairs of elements. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. 

To maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) are maximized.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - i - 1] - a[i]
        if n % 2 != 0:
            kq += a[n // 2]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty by ensuring that the smallest and largest elements are paired optimally.
