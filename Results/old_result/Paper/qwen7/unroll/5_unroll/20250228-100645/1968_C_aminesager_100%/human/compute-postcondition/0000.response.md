Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The states of the other variables (`n` and `x`) are not affected.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the specified range. The variables `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
