Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the first element in the list `data`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `index = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. No other changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
