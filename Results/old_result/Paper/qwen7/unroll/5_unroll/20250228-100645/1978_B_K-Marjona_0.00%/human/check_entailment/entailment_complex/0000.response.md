Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`, which is the correct approach to determine how many buns should be sold at the modified price.
4. If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`, which is correct because selling all buns at the usual price would yield the maximum profit.
5. If `b > a`, it uses the formula \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\) to calculate the profit, which is also correct. This formula accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and the remaining buns sold at the usual price.

Given the logic and the formula used, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
