Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without exceeding the available buns (`n`) or the condition `b - a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - If `b <= a`, it means the usual price `a` is higher than or equal to the modified price `b`, so it makes no sense to sell any buns at the modified price. Hence, the function prints `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula:
     - The sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices: `(b + (b - k + 1)) // 2 * k`
     - The profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`: `(n - k) * a`

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `b <= a`, the function correctly handles the case where no buns are sold at the modified price.
   - When `k == 0`, the function correctly calculates the profit as if all buns were sold at the usual price `a`.

Given these points, the function accurately computes the maximum profit for each test case, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
