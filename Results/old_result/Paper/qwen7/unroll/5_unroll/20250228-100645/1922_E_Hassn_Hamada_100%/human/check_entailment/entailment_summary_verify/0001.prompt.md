You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append elements to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns two zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences, `X`. The array length should not exceed 200, and all elements should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

2. **Input and Output Format**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we need to output either `-1` if no such array exists, or the length of the array followed by the array elements.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to generate the sequence based on the input number.
   - The function uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Bit Manipulation Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value in the current sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the next segment (`size`) and its starting value (`value`).
   - It checks if the calculated `value` can fit into the remaining `number`.
   - If it fits, it updates the `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
   - It then appends the appropriate values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with `n-1` (since the function is designed to handle `n-1`).
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case when `number` is 0.
   - It ensures that the sequence is built correctly using bit manipulation and recursion.

### Verification:

- The function `func_1` correctly generates sequences based on the input number.
- The main loop processes each test case and prints the results in the correct format.
- The logic for generating the sequence seems sound and should produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
