Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]**.

Explanation: The given code is a docstring that describes the function's purpose and arguments. It does not contain any executable statements that would alter the values of the variables `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the initial states of these variables remain unchanged.
