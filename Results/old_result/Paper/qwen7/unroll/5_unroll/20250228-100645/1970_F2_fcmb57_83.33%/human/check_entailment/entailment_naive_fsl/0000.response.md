Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle and another player moves to the same cell. According to the problem description, if a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated while in the same cell as a Bludger, the Quaffle remains at that cell. However, the program does not account for this scenario. Here is an example to demonstrate this issue:

### Example Input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

### Expected Output:
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

### Actual Output:
```
11 B0 ELIMINATED
FINAL SCORE: 0 0
```

In this example, the red player (R0) picks up the Quaffle, moves to the same cell as the blue player (B0), and is eliminated. The blue player then moves to the same cell and is also eliminated. The program incorrectly prints `B0 ELIMINATED` and does not handle the Quaffle remaining at the cell after the elimination of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
