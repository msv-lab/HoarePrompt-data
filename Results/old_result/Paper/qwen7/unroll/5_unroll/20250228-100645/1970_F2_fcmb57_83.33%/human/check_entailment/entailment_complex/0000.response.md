Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input to identify the dimensions of the field, the initial positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. The program correctly handles the movement of players and the Bludger, updating their positions based on the given directions.
3. The function `func_1` is correctly defined to calculate the new position of a player or the Bludger based on the direction provided.
4. The program correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle by players.
5. The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly.
6. The program correctly handles player elimination when a player and a Bludger occupy the same cell.
7. The program prints the events in the correct order and format.
8. The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
