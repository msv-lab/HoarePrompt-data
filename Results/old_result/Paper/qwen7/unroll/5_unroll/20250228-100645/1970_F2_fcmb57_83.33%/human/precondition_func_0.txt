a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N strings in total. The list contains characters representing empty cells ('..'), players ('R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9'), goals ('RG', 'BG'), the Quaffle ('.Q'), and a Bludger ('.B'). Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'R0 D', 'R0 C .Q', etc.).
