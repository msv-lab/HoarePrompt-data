Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input dimensions \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It initializes dictionaries for players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles movements using the `func_1` function.
   - It checks for collisions with Bludgers and eliminates players accordingly.
   - It correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
   - The program correctly handles scoring scenarios and prints the appropriate messages.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The scoring logic is correct. When a player scores in the opponent's goal, the correct team gets a point.
   - The program correctly resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The program correctly handles elimination events and prints them in the required format.

4. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly according to the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
