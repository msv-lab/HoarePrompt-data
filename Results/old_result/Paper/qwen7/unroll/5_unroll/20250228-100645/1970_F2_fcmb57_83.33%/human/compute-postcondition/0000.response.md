Output State: **a is split into x and y, b remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = a` unpacks the tuple `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` represents the dimensions N and M of the field, it is a tuple containing two integers. After executing this line, `x` will hold the first element of `a` (which is `N`), and `y` will hold the second element of `a` (which is `M`). The initial values of `b` remain unchanged.
