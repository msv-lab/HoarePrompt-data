Reasoning:
1. The provided program seems to follow the problem description closely. It initializes the field, processes the movements and actions of players and balls, and correctly updates the score and prints the necessary outputs.
2. The `func_1` function is used to update the position of players based on the direction of movement. The function correctly adds the movement vector to the current position.
3. The program handles the scoring and elimination of players appropriately. When a player scores, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the appropriate message is printed.
4. The program correctly handles the elimination of players when they collide with a Bludger and prints the relevant messages.
5. The program ensures that the final score is printed at the end of the game.

Given the execution summary and the code analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
