### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `t`, `n`, and `m` for each test case. It also correctly handles the parsing of each screenshot's order.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `m == 1`, the program prints 'yes' immediately, which is correct since a single screenshot can always match the original order.
   - If `m > 1`, the program checks if the first two screenshots (`l1` and `l2`) have the same elements except for the author of the screenshot. This is a crucial step to ensure that the initial comparison is consistent.

3. **Index Matching**:
   - The program identifies the positions where the author of the screenshot appears in both lists (`l1` and `l2`). This is done to find a common starting point for the orders.
   - Based on these indices, the program tries to align the orders of the participants.

4. **Validation**:
   - For subsequent screenshots, the program checks if the elements in the screenshot match the expected order after inserting the author at the identified index.
   - If any screenshot fails this validation, the program prints 'no'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the indices do not match perfectly and needs to insert the author at the appropriate position.
   - It also handles cases where more than two screenshots need to be validated.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'yes' if all screenshots match the derived order, and 'no' otherwise.

Given the detailed logic and the steps involved, the annotated program seems to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The program correctly handles all the described scenarios and outputs the correct result based on the input provided.

### Correctness:
**True**
