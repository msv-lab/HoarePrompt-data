Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to properly validate the order of participants in the screenshots for all test cases. Here's an example where the program incorrectly outputs "YES":

Consider the following input:
```
3
4 2
1 2 3 4
3 2 1 4
6 2
1 3 5 2 4 6
6 3 5 2 1 4
3 3
1 2 3
2 3 1
3 2 1
```

The expected output for this case is "NO" because the second screenshot does not match the order derived from the first screenshot. However, the program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it does not properly compare the orders of participants in the screenshots.

The program's logic for comparing the orders of participants in the screenshots is flawed. It does not correctly handle cases where the orders do not align, leading to incorrect results.
