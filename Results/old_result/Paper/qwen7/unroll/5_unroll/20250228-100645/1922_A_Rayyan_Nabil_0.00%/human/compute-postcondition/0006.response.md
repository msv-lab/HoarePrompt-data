Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20). It checks if for every position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the characters in `a[i]` and `b[i]` both match the character in `c[i]`. If there exists at least one position where this condition is not met, it sets `l` to 'YES'; otherwise, it sets `l` to 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `l` for each case.**
