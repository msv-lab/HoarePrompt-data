Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO', `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged.

After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `l` will be determined based on the conditions inside the nested loop. If for any string `i` from `n`, the characters at that position in `a` and `b` do not match the character at the same position in `c`, then `l` will be set to 'YES'. Otherwise, if no such positions exist, `l` will be set to 'NO'.
