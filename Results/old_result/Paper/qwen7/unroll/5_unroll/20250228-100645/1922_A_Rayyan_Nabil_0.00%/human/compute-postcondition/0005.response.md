Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and for each t, there are n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) positive integers a, b, and c, which are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. The function returns different values based on the conditions provided for each test case.**
