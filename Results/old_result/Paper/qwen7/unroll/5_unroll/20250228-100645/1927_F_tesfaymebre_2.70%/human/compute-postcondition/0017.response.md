Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables (n, m, edges, DSU) where (n, m) are integers with specific constraints, edges is a list of tuples representing edges in a graph, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure. The function performs operations based on these inputs and returns a result.**

This means the function `func_6` does not take any parameters but relies on external predefined variables `(n, m, edges, DSU)` to perform its operations and determine the return value.
