Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.**

Given the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`, and both represent valid directory names without leading zeros, the provided function signature `def func_1():` suggests that the function does not take any parameters and does not return any value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept no parameters and does not produce any output.
