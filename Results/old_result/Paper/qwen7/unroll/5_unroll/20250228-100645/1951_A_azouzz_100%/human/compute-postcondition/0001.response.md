State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used as the range parameter for the loop.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the `range(t)` function will not generate any values if `t` is less than or equal to 0.
3. The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.
