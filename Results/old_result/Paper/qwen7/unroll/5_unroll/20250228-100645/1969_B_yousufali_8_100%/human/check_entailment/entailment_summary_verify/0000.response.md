### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries against the problem description and the example given.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the chosen substring.
- The goal is to determine the minimum cost for each test case.

#### Provided Code:
```python
# Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

#### Function Summary:
- Function 2 processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case.
- Function 1 calculates a value that seems to be related to the positions of '1's and '0's in the string, but it does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts.

#### Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function counts the number of '0's followed by '1's and adds `n + 1` to the answer for each such occurrence.
   - This logic does not account for the actual cost of cyclic shifts, which is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - For example, in the string "101011", the function would count the positions of '0's and '1's but not the actual cost of shifting substrings.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - It processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost, `func_2` also does not produce the correct results.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the input "101011":
  - The function would count the positions of '0's and '1's and add `n + 1` for each transition.
  - This results in `ans = 5`, which is incorrect.
  - The optimal strategy involves multiple smaller shifts as mentioned in the original assessment, resulting in a total cost of 7.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal strategy of performing cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, as demonstrated by the example "101011" where the provided solution is incorrect.
