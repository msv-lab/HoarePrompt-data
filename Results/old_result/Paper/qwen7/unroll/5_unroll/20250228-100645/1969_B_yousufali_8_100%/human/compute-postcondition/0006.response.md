Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a binary string.
   - `n` is initialized to 0.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' in `s`. Here, `n` is the count of consecutive '1's before the '0'.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - For each '0' in the string `s`, we need to count the number of consecutive '1's that come before it.
   - We then add `n + 1` to `ans`.

For example, if `s = "1101101"`, let's go through the string:
- First '0': Before it, there are 2 consecutive '1's (`n = 2`), so `ans += 2 + 1 = 3`.
- Second '0': Before it, there are 2 consecutive '1's (`n = 2`), so `ans += 2 + 1 = 5`.

So, `ans` would be the sum of these values for all occurrences of '0' in the string.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement simply outputs the value of `ans`.

Since the exact binary string `s` is not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each occurrence of '0' in s, with n being the count of consecutive '1's before the '0')**
