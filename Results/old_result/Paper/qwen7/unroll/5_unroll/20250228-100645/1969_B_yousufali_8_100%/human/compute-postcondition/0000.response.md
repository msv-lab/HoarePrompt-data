Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). This integer replaces the previous value of `t`, which was an integer representing the number of test cases. The precondition that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases remains valid, and now `t` is updated with the actual integer input from the user. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning they are yet to be defined or initialized.
