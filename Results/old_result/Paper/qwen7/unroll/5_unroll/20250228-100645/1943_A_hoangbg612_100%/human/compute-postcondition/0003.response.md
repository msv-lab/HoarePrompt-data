Output State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. After executing all iterations of the loop, `cur` is the smallest number in the sorted list `N` that appears exactly once or the second smallest number among those that appear exactly once, if there are at least two such numbers. If no such number exists, `cur` will be -1.
