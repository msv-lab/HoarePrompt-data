### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the optimal strategy for both players based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by appending elements to her array `c` and deleting them from `a`.
- Bob only deletes elements from `a`.
- The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, where Alice aims to maximize it and Bob to minimize it.

#### Optimal Strategy:
- Alice should always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- Bob should pick the next smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
- The program sorts the array `N` and then iterates through it to identify the smallest number that appears exactly once or the second smallest number among those that appear exactly once.
- It does not simulate the optimal moves of both players.

#### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
- Alice picks `0` → `a = [0, 1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
- Bob picks `0` → `a = [1, 1]`, `c = [0]`.
- Alice picks `1` → `a = [1]`, `c = [0, 1]`.
- Bob picks `1` → `a = []`, `c = [0, 1]`.
- MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

**Program Output:**
- The program sorts `N` to `[0, 0, 1, 1]`.
- It finds that `0` appears twice and `1` appears twice.
- It sets `cur` to `-1` since no number appears exactly once.
- The program outputs `-1`.

This shows that the program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy of both players. The program fails to handle the optimal moves and instead relies on a flawed approach to determine the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and thus produces incorrect results.

**Final: False**
