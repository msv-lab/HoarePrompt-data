Output State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each iteration, after sorting the list N and processing it according to the given logic, the variable `cur` is printed. The final value of `cur` after all iterations is determined based on the processed data from each input list N.
