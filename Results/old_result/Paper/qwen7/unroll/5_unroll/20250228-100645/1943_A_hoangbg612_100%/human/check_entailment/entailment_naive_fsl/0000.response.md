Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

The correct output should be `2`, as explained in the example. However, the program will output `1` instead. This happens because the program does not properly simulate the optimal moves for both players. In the optimal play, Alice would pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob would pick the next smallest available number to minimize the MEX. The program fails to simulate this optimal strategy.

To verify this, let's consider the optimal play:
1. Alice picks `0`. Now `a = [0, 1, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks `0`. Now `a = [1, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks `1`. Now `a = [1]` and `c = [0, 1]`.
4. Bob picks `1`. Now `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.

The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`, which matches the expected output. However, the provided program does not correctly simulate this process and outputs `1` instead. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
