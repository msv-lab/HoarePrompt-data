Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only pick elements from `a` but cannot append them to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of `c` is what we need to compute.

3. **Analyzed Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` of the array `N` and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N` to populate a dictionary `M` where keys are the unique elements and values are their counts.
   - It tries to find the smallest number that appears exactly once or the second smallest number among those that appear exactly once.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in the code does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make decisions based on the current state of the game to achieve their respective goals.
   - The approach in the code focuses on finding the smallest number that appears exactly once, which might not always lead to the optimal MEX value.
   - The code does not consider the sequence of moves and the strategic choices made by both players during the game.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
