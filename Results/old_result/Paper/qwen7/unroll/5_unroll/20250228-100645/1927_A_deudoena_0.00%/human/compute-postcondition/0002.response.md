Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string which is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', and `ind2` is 0.**

The code initializes `ind2` to 0, which does not affect the values of `ind1`, `t`, or `inpstr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `ind2` is set to 0.
