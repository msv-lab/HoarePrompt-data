You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in s is black.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string which is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `ind1` is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string which is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', `ind2` is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`, `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: n - ind2 - ind1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input string `inpstr` containing characters 'W' and 'B', identifying the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B'. It then calculates and prints the length of the string minus these two indices, effectively returning the length of the substring between the first and last 'B' (if they exist). If no 'B' is found, the output will be the length of the string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make all cells white.
2. The provided solution does not correctly address the problem. Here's why:
   - The code attempts to find the indices of the first and last black cells (`ind1` and `ind2`).
   - However, it calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`, which is incorrect.
   - This formula calculates the distance between the first and last black cells but does not account for the possibility that there might be black cells in the middle that need to be covered by the segment.
3. A correct approach would involve checking the entire strip to find the longest sequence of consecutive white cells, as the segment to be painted should cover any gaps in these sequences.
4. The provided solution does not handle cases where multiple segments of black cells are present or where the strip starts or ends with black cells.

Correctness: **False**

A correct implementation would need to iterate through the string to identify the longest sequence of consecutive white cells and then calculate the required segment length based on the positions of the black cells relative to this sequence.
