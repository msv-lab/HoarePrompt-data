Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each input value of `t`, the program will process `n` characters from strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the processed template matches `a` and `b` but not `c`, it will print 'YES'; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The final output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' results corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
