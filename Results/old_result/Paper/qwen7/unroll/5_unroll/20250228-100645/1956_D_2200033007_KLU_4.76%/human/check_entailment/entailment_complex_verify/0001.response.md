### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided solution does not implement a general algorithm to solve the problem. Instead, it relies on hardcoded values for different lengths of the array, which is insufficient for handling all possible inputs. Let's analyze the annotated code and the examples provided to validate or challenge the original assessment.

1. **Hardcoded Values**: The function `func_1` uses hardcoded values for different lengths of the array:
   - If the length of the array `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Input:**
     ```
     2
     0 1
     ```
     - **Output:**
       ```
       4 1
       1 2
       ```
     - **Explanation:** This is correct because setting both elements to 2 maximizes the sum, which is 4. The operation `1 2` sets both elements to 2.
   
   - **Input:**
     ```
     3
     1 3 9
     ```
     - **Output:**
       ```
       13 0
       ```
     - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the maximum sum is 13 (the sum of the original array), and no operations are needed to achieve it. The solution incorrectly suggests that no operations are required, which is not always true.
   
   - **Input:**
     ```
     4
     1 100 2 1
     ```
     - **Output:**
       ```
       105 2
       3 3
       3 4
       ```
     - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the maximum sum is 104 (1 + 100 + 2 + 2), and the operations `3 3` and `3 4` do not necessarily maximize the sum. The solution incorrectly suggests that setting the last two elements to 2 maximizes the sum, but it could be better to set them to 100 to get a higher sum.
   
   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     0
     ```
     - **Output:**
       ```
       1 1
       1 1
       ```
     - **Explanation:** This is incorrect because the maximum sum is 1 (setting the single element to 1), and the operation `1 1` does not maximize the sum. The solution incorrectly suggests that setting the single element to 1 maximizes the sum, but it should be 0.

3. **General Case Handling**: The solution does not provide a general algorithm to determine the optimal operations for maximizing the sum. It only handles specific cases and does not account for the dynamic nature of the problem, where the optimal operations depend on the current values of the array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not implement a general algorithm to solve the problem and instead relies on hardcoded values, which is insufficient for handling all possible inputs. Therefore, the solution is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
