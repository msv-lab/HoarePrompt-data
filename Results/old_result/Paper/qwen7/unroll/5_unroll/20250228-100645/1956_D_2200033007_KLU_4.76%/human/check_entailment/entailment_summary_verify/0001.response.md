### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to maximize the sum of the elements in an array by performing a series of operations, where each operation sets a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. The operations are limited to \(5 \times 10^5\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array.
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` (the length of the array) and prints a hardcoded result based on the value of `c`.

   Here are the hardcoded results:
   - If `c == 2`, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `c` where the length of the list is between 1 and 18 (inclusive), and each element in the list is between 0 and \(10^7\) (inclusive).
   - It prints one of two messages based on the length of the list: "4 1" if the length is exactly 2, or "13 0" otherwise.
   - After executing the print statements, the function ends without returning any value.

4. **Evaluation of the Program**:
   - The program does not implement the logic to find the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it.
   - For \(n = 2\), the program correctly outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which means setting both elements to 2 maximizes the sum.
   - For \(n = 3\), the program incorrectly outputs `13 0`, implying no operations are needed to maximize the sum, but this is not generally true. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3]`, the maximum sum would be achieved by setting the entire array to 0, resulting in a sum of 0.
   - For \(n = 4\), the program outputs `105 2` with specific operations, but it doesn't show how these operations were derived. This suggests that the hardcoded values are not general and do not cover all possible scenarios.
   - The program does not handle general cases where the array might contain unique values or require multiple operations to maximize the sum.

Given that the solution does not provide a general algorithm to solve the problem and instead relies on hardcoded values, it is not correct for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not provide a general solution to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.
