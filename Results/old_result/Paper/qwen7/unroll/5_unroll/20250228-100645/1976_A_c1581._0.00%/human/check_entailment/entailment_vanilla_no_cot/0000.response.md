Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to verify if a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and then processes it, which is efficient for multiple test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: It iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (length of the password and the password itself).
3. **Separating Digits and Letters**: The function `func_1` correctly separates the digits and letters from the password.
4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - It checks if the digits are in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It ensures that no digit appears after a letter.
5. **Returning Results**: Based on the above checks, it returns "YES" or "NO" for each password.

Given these points, the program accurately determines whether each password is strong according to the specified rules.
