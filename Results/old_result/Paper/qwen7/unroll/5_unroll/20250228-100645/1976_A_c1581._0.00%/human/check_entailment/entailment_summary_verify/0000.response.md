### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem requirements and the function summary.

1. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the digits in the password are in ascending order and if the letters are in ascending order.
   - However, the function does not check if the sequence of characters in the password itself adheres to the requirement that no digit comes after a letter. This is a critical part of the problem statement.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - The function `func_1` splits the password into digits and letters, sorts them separately, and then checks if they meet the criteria.
   - The main loop in the program calls `func_1` for each password and collects the results.

3. **Verification Against Test Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: "12ac" -> Correctly returns "YES" as both digits and letters are sorted.
   - **Test Case 2**: "123wa" -> Incorrectly returns "NO" because the digits "123" are not sorted in non-decreasing order relative to the letters "wa".
   - **Test Case 3**: "allllmost" -> Correctly returns "YES" as all letters are sorted.
   - **Test Case 4**: "ac123" -> Incorrectly returns "NO" because the digit "1" comes after the letter "a".
   - **Test Case 5**: "011679" -> Correctly returns "YES" as all digits are sorted.

From these observations, we can see that the program fails to handle the condition where digits come after letters, which is a critical requirement. The function `func_1` does not enforce this condition, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly verify the condition that no digit comes after a letter, leading to incorrect outputs for certain test cases.

**Final: False**
