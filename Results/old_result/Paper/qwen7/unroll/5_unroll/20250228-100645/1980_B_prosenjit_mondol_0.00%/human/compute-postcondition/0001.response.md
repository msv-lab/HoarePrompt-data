Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES', 'NO', and 'MAYBE' based on the comparison between the k-th largest element in the sorted list (excluding the first element) and the element at the position f in the original list. For each test case, if the k-th largest element is greater than the element at position f, the output is 'NO'. If it is smaller, the output is 'YES'. If they are equal, the output is 'YES' unless the k-th element is the second-largest in the list, in which case the output is 'MAYBE'.
