The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then sorts the list `a` in descending order. Based on the comparison between the `f`-th element and the `k`-th element of the sorted list, it prints either 'NO', 'YES', or 'MAYBE'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
