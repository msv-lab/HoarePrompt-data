### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if it meets the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. The sequence `a` must have a size at most 25.
2. There should be no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
3. For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Constructing the Sequence `nums`:**
   - A list `nums` is initialized with the first 24 powers of 2 (`[1, 2, 4, ..., 16777216]`).
   - The index `idx` is determined such that `1 << idx` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - The element `k - nums[idx]` is appended to `nums`.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are also appended to `nums`.
   - The element `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - The element `k - nums[idx]` ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because if `k - nums[idx]` is included in a subsequence, the remaining part of the sum would be `nums[idx]`, which is a power of 2 and cannot form `k` when combined with any other elements in `nums`.
   - The elements `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that the sequence can still form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

2. **Ensuring All Sums from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The list `nums` contains the first 24 powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{24} - 1\).
   - By appending `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the sequence can cover all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.

3. **Correctness of the Implementation:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and uses it to construct the sequence.
   - The removal of `1 << idx` ensures that the sequence does not trivially include `k` as a subsequence.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem statement and the provided annotations.
