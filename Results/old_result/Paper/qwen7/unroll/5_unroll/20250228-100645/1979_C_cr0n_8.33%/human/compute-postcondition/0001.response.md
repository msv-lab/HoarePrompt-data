Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50, `vals` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `vals` by splitting the input string (which is expected to contain space-separated integers) into individual strings, converting each string to an integer, and then storing these integers in the list `vals`. The variables `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial states.
