Reasoning:

1. The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
2. The annotated program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
3. Inside `func_1()`, it reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `vals`.
4. It calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
5. It then creates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`.
6. It calculates `den` as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
7. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
8. Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

Let's verify the logic:
- The product `prod` of all multipliers ensures that `vprod[i] = prod / vals[i]` is an integer.
- Since `den = prod - sum(vprod)` and `sum(vprod) = prod - den`, `den` represents the remaining amount after accounting for the bets.
- If `den > 0`, it means the total bet is strictly less than the total amount received for any winning outcome.

Given the logic and the steps, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
