Reasoning:

1. The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
2. The annotated program correctly calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
3. It then creates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`.
4. The difference `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`.
5. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
6. If `den` is greater than 0, it prints the values in `vprod`, which should satisfy the condition that the total bet is less than the payout for any winning outcome.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotated program, the program correctly implements the required functionality. It checks the condition and prints the appropriate result.

Correctness: **True**
