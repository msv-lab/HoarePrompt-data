Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `v`, which iterates over the elements of the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `v`**: Since `v` is iterating over the elements of `arr`, the first value of `v` should be the first element of `arr`.

3. **Determine the state of `arr`**: The list `arr` is already defined and contains integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.

4. **Determine the state of other variables**: The variables `prefix`, `t`, and `n` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the first element of `arr`.

**State:**
- `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.
- The first element of `arr` (which will be assigned to `v` in the first iteration) must be defined.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, and the first element of `arr` must be defined**.
