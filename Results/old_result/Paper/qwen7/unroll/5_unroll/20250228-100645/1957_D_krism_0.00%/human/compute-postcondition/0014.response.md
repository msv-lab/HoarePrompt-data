Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [1, 0]; `suf` is a list of 32 lists, where each list contains the count of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values of all elements in `arr` up to each point, counted from the most significant bit to the least significant bit.
