You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the cumulative XOR of the integers up to each point and then counts the occurrences of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of these cumulative XOR values. Finally, it computes a result based on these counts and prints the total sum. The function does not return any value but prints the final result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array itself.
   
2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - It calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `prefix` list.
   - This part is correct and necessary for the solution.

3. **Pre and Suffix Count Arrays:**
   - The program initializes two 2D arrays `pre` and `suf` to count the occurrences of each bit being set or not set in the prefix and suffix parts.
   - The initialization of `pre` is correct, but the logic for updating `suf` is flawed. The `suf` array should be updated from the end of the array to the beginning, which is done correctly in the loop.

4. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - The logic for counting valid tuples is incorrect. The program incorrectly assumes that the number of valid tuples can be calculated by simply multiplying counts from `pre` and `suf` arrays.

5. **Updating Pre and Suffix Count Arrays:**
   - The program updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays while iterating through the array, which is a good approach.
   - However, the way the counts are updated and used to calculate the number of valid tuples is flawed.

### Detailed Issues:
- The main issue lies in the calculation of the number of valid tuples. The current implementation does not correctly account for the XOR conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The program incorrectly assumes that the XOR condition can be met by simply multiplying counts from the `pre` and `suf` arrays, which is not accurate.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
