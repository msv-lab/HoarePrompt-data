Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing only the element 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.**

The code initializes the list `prefix` with a single element, which is 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
