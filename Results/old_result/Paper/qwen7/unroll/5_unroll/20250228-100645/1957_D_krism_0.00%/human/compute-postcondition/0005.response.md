Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element at index i (starting from 0) is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to index i, `t` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains unchanged as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `arr` remains unchanged as a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers.
