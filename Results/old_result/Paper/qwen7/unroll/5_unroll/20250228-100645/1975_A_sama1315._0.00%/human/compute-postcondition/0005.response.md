Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer from data at index 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of `index`, `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and a new variable `results` is introduced as an empty list.
