Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `[1, 3, 2]`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (We can split the array into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`, and further split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, then swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`, and finally split `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]` which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]`).

However, `func_1` would return `No` because it only checks if the array is already sorted, without considering the possibility of rearranging through the specified operation.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
