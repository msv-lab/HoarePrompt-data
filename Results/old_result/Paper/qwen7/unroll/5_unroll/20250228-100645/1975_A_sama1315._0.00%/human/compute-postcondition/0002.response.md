Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial states.
