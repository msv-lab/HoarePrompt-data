Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not sufficient. The problem requires checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if there exists a split point such that the array can be rearranged into a non-decreasing sequence by swapping the two parts. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    # Check if the array is already sorted
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)):
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Find the split point
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        # If the current element is greater than the next one, try to find a valid split
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Check if the remaining part is sorted
            if all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(i + 1, len(arr) - 1)):
                # Check if the first part followed by the reversed second part is sorted
                if all(arr[k] <= arr[k + 1] for k in range(i + 1)):
                    return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

# Function 2 remains the same
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Your response:
Correctness: **True**
```

This corrected solution checks if the array can be split at any point and rearranged to be non-decreasing. If such a split exists, it returns 'Yes', otherwise, it returns 'No'.
