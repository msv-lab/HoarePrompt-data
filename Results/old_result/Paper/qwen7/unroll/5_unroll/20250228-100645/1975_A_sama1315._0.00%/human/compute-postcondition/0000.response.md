Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n. The function `input` is replaced with `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or `arr`. It only changes how input is read from the standard input. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain the same as per the initial state.
