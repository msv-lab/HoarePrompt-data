State before the loop starts: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(q):`, which means the loop will iterate `q` times.
2. The loop head does not contain any variables or objects that are initialized or modified within the loop itself. Instead, it uses an underscore `_` as the loop variable, which is typically used when the loop variable is not needed inside the loop body.
3. Since the loop variable `_` is not used, and no other variables or objects are modified or referenced within the loop, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that the loop can execute `q` times.

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q`, ensuring that it is a positive integer since the loop will iterate `q` times.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` must be a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value**
