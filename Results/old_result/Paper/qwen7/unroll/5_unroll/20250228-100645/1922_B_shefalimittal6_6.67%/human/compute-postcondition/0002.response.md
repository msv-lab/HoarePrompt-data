Output State: **A series of integers representing the value of `res` for each iteration of the loop. Each value of `res` is calculated based on the input values of `n` and the list of integers `nums` for that particular iteration.**

This output state describes the result of running the given loop for each input provided within the range specified by `t`. For each iteration, `res` is computed based on the frequency of numbers in the list `nums` and printed at the end of each iteration.
