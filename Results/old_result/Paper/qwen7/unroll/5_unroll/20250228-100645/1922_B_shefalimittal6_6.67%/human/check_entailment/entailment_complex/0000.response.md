Reasoning:
1. The problem requires counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
2. The solution provided uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count the frequency of each stick length.
3. For each frequency count (`cnt`), it correctly handles the following:
   - If there are at least 3 sticks of the same length, it uses combinations to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from those of the same length.
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of the same length, it calculates the total number of other sticks and multiplies it by the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from those of the same length.
4. The logic for calculating combinations is correct using `math.comb`.
5. The overall approach correctly handles the constraints and examples provided.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
