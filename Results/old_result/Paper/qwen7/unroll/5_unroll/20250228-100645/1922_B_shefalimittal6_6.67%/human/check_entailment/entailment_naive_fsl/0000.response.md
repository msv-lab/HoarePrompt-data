Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
4
2 2 3 3
```
- Expected output:
```
4
```
- Actual output:
```
0
```

The program fails to consider the combinations where the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side. For example, with the sticks of lengths \(2, 2, 3\), we can form a triangle with the combinations \((2, 2, 3)\), but the program does not count this combination because it does not properly check the triangle inequality conditions.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate through all possible combinations of three sticks and check if they satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
