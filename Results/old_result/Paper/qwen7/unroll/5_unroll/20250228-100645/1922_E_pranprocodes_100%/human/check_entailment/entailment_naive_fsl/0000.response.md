Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by \(X\). Instead, it generates an array using a pattern that does not guarantee the exact number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the program alternates between appending the maximum and minimum possible values, decrementing the maximum and incrementing the minimum in each iteration. This approach does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

For example, consider \(X = 3\). The program might output an array like \([-1, 0, -1]\), which does not have exactly 3 increasing subsequences. The increasing subsequences would include \([-1], [0], [-1], [0, -1]\), totaling 4 subsequences, which is incorrect.

To meet the problem requirements, the program needs to generate an array where the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \(X\). This typically involves generating a specific pattern of numbers, such as a sequence of repeated numbers with gaps, which the current implementation does not achieve.
