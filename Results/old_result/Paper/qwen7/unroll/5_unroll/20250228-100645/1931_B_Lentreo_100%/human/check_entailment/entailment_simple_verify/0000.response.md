### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water units `nums`.

2. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program calculates the total sum of water units in all containers.
   - It checks if the total sum is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - This check ensures that it's even possible to distribute the water equally among all containers, as the sum of the water units must be divisible by `n` for such a distribution to be feasible.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`).
   - This value represents the target amount of water each container should have if the water is distributed evenly.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the list of water units and keeps a running balance of the difference between the current sum and the target sum.
   - It updates the balance by adding the difference between the current water unit and the mean to the running balance (`curr += nums[i] - mean`).
   - If at any point the balance goes negative (`curr < 0`), it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, so it returns 'NO'.
   - Since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, the total sum of the differences between each element and the mean will always balance out to 0. Therefore, `curr` will never become negative during the iteration.

Given these steps, the program correctly handles all described cases without any edge cases being missed. The logic ensures that if the sum of the water units is divisible by `n`, it is possible to distribute the water equally among all containers, and the program will return 'YES' in such cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
