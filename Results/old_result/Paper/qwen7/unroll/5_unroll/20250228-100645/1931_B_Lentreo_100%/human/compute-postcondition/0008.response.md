State before the loop starts: `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is at least 1.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the length of `nums`.
- `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`.
- `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.
- `curr` is 0 (not relevant for the loop execution).

Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` starts from 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `i`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
