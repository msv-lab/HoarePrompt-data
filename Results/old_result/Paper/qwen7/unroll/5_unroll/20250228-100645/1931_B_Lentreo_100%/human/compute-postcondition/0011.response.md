Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the length of `nums`
- The sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`
- `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`
- `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`
- `curr` is 0

The code snippet provided does not contain any actual loop or operations that would change the value of `curr`. It simply returns `'YES'` based on the condition that the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, which is already given as true in the initial state. Therefore, the program returns `'YES'`.
