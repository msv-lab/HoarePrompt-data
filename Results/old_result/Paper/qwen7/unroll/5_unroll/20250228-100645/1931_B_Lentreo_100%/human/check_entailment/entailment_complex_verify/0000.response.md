### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - This part is handled correctly by the outer loop `for _ in range(t):`.

2. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers and checks if this total is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - This check is necessary because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to distribute the water equally among all containers. This is a crucial correctness condition.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is `mean = total // n`.
   - This value represents the target amount of water each container should have if the water is to be distributed equally.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the list of water units and keeps a running balance of the difference between the current sum and the target sum.
   - Specifically, it initializes `curr` to 0 and updates it by adding `nums[i] - mean` for each element in the list.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, so it returns 'NO'.
   - Since the total sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, and `curr` starts at 0, it will never go negative because each addition of `(nums[i] - mean)` will either keep `curr` at 0 or make it positive (due to the balance condition).

Given these points, the program correctly handles all described cases without any edge cases being missed. The logic ensures that if the total sum of water is divisible by `n`, it is always possible to distribute the water equally among the containers, and the program correctly identifies this possibility.
