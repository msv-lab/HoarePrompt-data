### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these digit sums.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an array `values` where `values[i]` stores the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( i \).
   - It iterates through each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` array accordingly.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints `values[n]`, which gives the required sum.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) because for each integer \( i \) up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), we calculate the sum of its digits, which takes \( O(\log i) \) time.
   - The query step for each test case runs in \( O(1) \) since it just involves an array lookup.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The precomputation ensures that for any \( n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), the sum of the digit sums can be quickly retrieved.
   - The logic for summing the digits and updating the `values` array is correct.
   - The input handling and output generation are also correctly implemented.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the upper limit \( 2 \times 10^5 \) correctly.
   - It efficiently handles multiple test cases within the given time constraint (0.5 seconds).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficient for the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
