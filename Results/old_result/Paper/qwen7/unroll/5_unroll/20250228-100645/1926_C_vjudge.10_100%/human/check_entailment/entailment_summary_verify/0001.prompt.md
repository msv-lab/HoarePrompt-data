You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        print(values[value])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then reads `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). It calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` and stores these sums in a list. Finally, for each `n` in a test case, it prints the precomputed sum of digits up to `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these digit sums.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an array `values` where `values[i]` stores the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( i \).
   - It iterates through each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` array accordingly.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints `values[n]`, which gives the required sum.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) because for each integer \( i \) up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), we calculate the sum of its digits, which takes \( O(\log i) \) time.
   - The query step for each test case runs in \( O(1) \) since it just involves an array lookup.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The precomputation ensures that for any \( n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), the sum of the digit sums can be quickly retrieved.
   - The logic for summing the digits and updating the `values` array is correct.
   - The input handling and output generation are also correctly implemented.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the upper limit \( 2 \times 10^5 \) correctly.
   - It efficiently handles multiple test cases within the given time constraint (0.5 seconds).

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficient for the problem statement.
