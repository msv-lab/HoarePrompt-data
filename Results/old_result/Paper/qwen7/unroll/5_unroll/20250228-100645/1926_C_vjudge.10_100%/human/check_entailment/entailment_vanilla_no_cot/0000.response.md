Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issue lies in how it calculates and stores the sums of digit sums for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5`. This approach is inefficient and unnecessary because it precomputes the sums for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5`, which is not required. Instead, we need to compute the sum of digit sums for each individual number in each test case.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            total_sum += sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This version directly computes the sum of digit sums for each number in the range from 1 to `n` for each test case, which is both more efficient and correct.
