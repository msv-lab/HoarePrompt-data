Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `1` to `inf`, where `inf` is defined as `200001`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: Since the loop starts at `1`, the initial value of `i` should be `1`.

4. **Check the termination condition**: The loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than `inf` (which is `200001`). Therefore, `i` must be less than `200001` for the loop to continue executing.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that `i` starts at `1` and remains less than `200001` throughout the loop executions.

**State:**
- `t` is an input integer, \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)
- `inf` is `200001`
- `values` is a list of `200001` zeros
- `i` is `1` (initial value) and must be less than `200001`

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is an input integer, \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `inf` is `200001`, `values` is a list of `200001` zeros, `i` is `1` and must be less than `200001`**.
