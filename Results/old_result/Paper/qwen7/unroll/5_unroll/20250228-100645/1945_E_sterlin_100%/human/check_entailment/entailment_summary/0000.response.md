Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation such that a specific value \(x\) is found at the position \(l\) using at most 2 swaps. This is done before performing a binary search to ensure \(p_l = x\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Returns the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()`: Returns the size of the permutation and the target value \(x\).
   - `func_3()`: Returns the permutation itself.
   - `func_4()` and `func_5()`: These functions are not used in the provided code and thus are irrelevant for our analysis.
3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases, the size of the permutation, and the permutation itself.
   - It uses a dictionary to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - It performs a binary search-like operation to find the position where \(x\) should be placed.
   - If \(x\) is already at the correct position, it prints 0.
   - If \(x\) is not at the correct position but is not seen (indicating it's not in the current permutation), it performs one swap to bring \(x\) to the correct position.
   - If \(x\) is not at the correct position and is seen, it performs two swaps to ensure \(x\) is at the correct position.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \(x\) is not in the permutation by ensuring it is brought to the correct position.
   - The logic for performing exactly 2 swaps when necessary is correctly implemented.

Given the analysis, the provided code meets the requirements of the problem statement and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
