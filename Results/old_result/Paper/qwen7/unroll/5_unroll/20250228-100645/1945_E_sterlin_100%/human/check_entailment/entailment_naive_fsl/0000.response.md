Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any implementation of the required functionality. Instead, it defines several placeholder functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that are meant to read input but are not used in the main logic of the program. The main logic to solve the problem is missing entirely. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
