Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs including the permutation `p`, the array `a`, and the starting positions `pb` and `ps`.
3. The program handles the special case where both players start with the maximum value in the array `a`. In such cases, it correctly prints 'Draw'.
4. The program then simulates the game for `k` turns, calculating the scores for both players based on their positions and the values in the array `a`.
5. It considers the optimal moves for both players to maximize their scores.
6. Finally, it compares the total scores of 'Bodya' and 'Sasha' and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the detailed steps and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly according to the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
