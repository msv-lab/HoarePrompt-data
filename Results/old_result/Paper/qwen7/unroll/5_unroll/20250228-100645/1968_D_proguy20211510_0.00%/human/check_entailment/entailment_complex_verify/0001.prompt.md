You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. The loop processes different inputs for `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` in each iteration, and prints either 'Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha' based on the comparison of scores calculated from the lists `b` and `s`. Since the specific inputs are not provided, the exact output state cannot be determined. However, it will consist of a series of 'Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha' outputs corresponding to each iteration's result.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), along with arrays \( p \) and \( a \). For each test case, it determines whether 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' should be printed based on the maximum values in the arrays and their positions. The function iterates through the given inputs, calculates scores for 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', and compares them to decide the winner. If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Max Value Check:**
   - The program checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya (`pb`) and Sasha (`ps`) are equal to the maximum value in the array `a`.
   - If both scores are equal to the maximum value, it prints "Draw".
   - If only Bodya's score is the maximum, it prints "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha's score is the maximum, it prints "Sasha".
   - This part handles some base cases correctly.

3. **Dynamic Scoring Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then iterates over the `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
   - The logic for updating the positions and scores seems to handle the movement and scoring rules correctly.
   - However, there are some issues in how the scores are calculated and stored.

4. **Score Accumulation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - The logic for calculating the final scores seems to be flawed because it assumes that the maximum score will be achieved by following the path that includes the maximum value multiple times, which is not necessarily true.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.
   - This part of the logic is also flawed because it does not correctly account for all possible paths and strategies the players might take.

### Issues Identified:
- The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum score will always be achieved by following the path that includes the maximum value multiple times.
- The dynamic scoring calculation does not fully account for all possible paths and strategies the players might take.
- The program does not handle all edge cases and scenarios correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. The scoring and path selection logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results in many cases.
