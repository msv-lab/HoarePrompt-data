Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n and k (integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 and 1 and 10^9 respectively), P_B and P_S (integers between 1 and n), and two additional parameters p (a permutation of length n) and a (an array of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes these inputs according to some unspecified logic.**
