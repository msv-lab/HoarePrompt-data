The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `lst` and calculates two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` that store intermediate results. It then handles `m` queries, each providing two indices `start` and `end`. For each query, it computes the minimum value between the absolute differences obtained from `d1` and `d2` and prints the result.
