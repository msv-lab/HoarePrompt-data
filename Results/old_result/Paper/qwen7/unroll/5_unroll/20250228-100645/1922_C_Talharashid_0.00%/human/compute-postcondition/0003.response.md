Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each input value of t, there are two dictionaries d1 and d2 which store intermediate results of the calculations. There is a list lst which contains integers based on user input. Variable s is used to accumulate values during the calculation process. After processing all inputs, there are m queries where start and end indices are provided, and for each query, the minimum value between the absolute differences calculated from d1 and d2 is printed.
