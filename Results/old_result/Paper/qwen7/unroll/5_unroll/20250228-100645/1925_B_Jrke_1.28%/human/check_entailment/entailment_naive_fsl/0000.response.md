Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x`. In such a case, the GCD of the difficulties cannot be higher than 1 because the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself. However, the program does not ensure that the difficulties are chosen such that their GCD is maximized in all cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 3
```
The program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `1` because the only way to split 7 into 3 parts is `[1, 1, 5]` or permutations thereof, which gives a GCD of 1. The program fails to handle this edge case correctly.
