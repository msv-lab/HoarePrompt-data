Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes three variables t, x, and n, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, x is a positive integer between 1 and 10^8, and n is a positive integer between 1 and x. The function does not return anything explicitly but seems to process these variables within its body.**

Given the constraints, the function likely performs some operation or validation involving these three variables, but since the exact operation is not specified, the description focuses on the nature of the input variables.
