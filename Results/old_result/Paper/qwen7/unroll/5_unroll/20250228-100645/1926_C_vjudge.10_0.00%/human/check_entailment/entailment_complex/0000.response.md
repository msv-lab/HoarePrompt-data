Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
2. The provided code snippet, however, does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it attempts to sum the digits of each number from 0 to \( n-1 \), which is not what the problem requires.
3. The `func_1` function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number \( n \).
4. However, the main loop iterates over the range from 0 to \( N-1 \) and calls `func_1` for each number in this range, which is not aligned with the problem statement.
5. The variable `N` is read from input, but the loop should be iterating from 1 to \( n \) for each test case, not from 0 to \( N-1 \).

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
