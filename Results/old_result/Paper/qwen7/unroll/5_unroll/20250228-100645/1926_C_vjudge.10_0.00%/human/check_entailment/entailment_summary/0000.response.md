Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.
2. The main issue lies in the loop structure and the function `func_1` being called.
3. The program reads `N`, which is the number of test cases, but it then enters a loop that iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` each time. However, inside this loop, it calls `func_1(i)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This means it processes each integer from 0 to `n-1` for each test case, instead of processing the integers from 1 to `n`.
4. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number, but it is applied to the wrong range of numbers.
5. The final result is accumulated in `soma`, but it accumulates results from multiple test cases incorrectly due to the nested loops and incorrect range of numbers processed.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
