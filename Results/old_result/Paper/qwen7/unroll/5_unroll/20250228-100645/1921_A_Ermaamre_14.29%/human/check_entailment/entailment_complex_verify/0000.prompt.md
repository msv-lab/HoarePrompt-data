You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: Output State: The value of `res` squared for each iteration based on the conditions given in the loop. The final output state will be a list of these squared values, one for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integer coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it checks if the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. If the conditions are met, it calculates the side length of the square, squares it, and prints the result. The final output is a series of squared side lengths, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to identify pairs of points that share the same x-coordinate to determine the side length of the square. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for all possible configurations of the square's corners. Specifically, the program only checks three out of the six possible pairs of points that could share the same x or y coordinate. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 1
2 2
-1 -1
-2 -2
```

In this case, the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, but the program will not correctly identify the side length. The program only checks the pairs (1, 2), (1, -1), and (2, -2), none of which directly provide the side length of the square. Therefore, the program will not work for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
