The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of four pairs of integer coordinates representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it checks if the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. If the conditions are met, it calculates the side length of the square, squares it, and prints the result. The final output is a series of squared side lengths, one for each test case.
