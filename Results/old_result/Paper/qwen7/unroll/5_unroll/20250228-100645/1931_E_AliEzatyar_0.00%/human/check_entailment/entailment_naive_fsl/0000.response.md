Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules as described. Specifically, the program does not simulate the game turns properly. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Implementation**: The program does not simulate the game turns where Anna and Sasha take alternating turns. Instead, it calculates some properties of the numbers in the list and makes a decision based on those properties without simulating the actual game process.

2. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in the reversed numbers. However, the logic to determine the winner based on the total number of digits and trailing zeros is flawed. The program does not simulate the game turns where players make their moves and reduce the list size until only one number remains.

3. **Winning Condition Check**: The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not correctly checking the winning condition. This condition does not accurately reflect whether Sasha can form a number greater than or equal to \(10^m\) after Anna's move.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game and cannot determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
