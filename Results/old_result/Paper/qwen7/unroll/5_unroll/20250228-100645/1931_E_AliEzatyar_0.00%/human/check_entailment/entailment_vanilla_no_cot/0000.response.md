Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Digits**: The `total_digits` variable should count the total number of digits in the numbers, not the lengths of the strings. The current implementation counts the length of the string representation of each number, which is not the same as the total number of digits.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in a number. However, the logic in the main program incorrectly uses the result of `func_1` to determine the number of trailing zeros. This is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic for determining whether Sasha or Anna wins is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` is not based on the actual game rules and does not correctly reflect the conditions under which Sasha or Anna can win.

4. **Missing Handling of Game Rules**: The program does not properly simulate the game rules, including the alternating turns between Anna and Sasha, and the conditions under which Sasha can win by having a number of at least \(10^m\).

To correctly solve the problem, you need to implement a strategy that simulates the game and determines the winner based on the optimal moves of both players. The current implementation does not achieve this.
