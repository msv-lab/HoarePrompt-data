#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of integers, where the length of num (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer (a_i) in the list satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Additionally, the parameter m for each test case satisfies 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: counter is the number of '0' characters from the end of num until the first non-'0' character.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of '0' characters from the end of num until the first non-'0' character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the count of trailing zeros (represented as '0' characters) in the list until the first non-zero element is encountered. If there are no trailing zeros, it returns zero.
