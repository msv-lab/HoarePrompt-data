Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed does not account for the possibility that the favorite cube might be removed if there are enough cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube's value, but fewer than `k` cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the favorite cube (value 3) is in the second position. After sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. There are 3 cubes with a value greater than 3, which is more than `k = 2`. However, there are also 3 cubes with the same value as the favorite cube, so it is possible that the favorite cube could be removed if the cubes with the same value are positioned such that the first two cubes removed are not the favorite cube and another cube with the same value. The current implementation incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the count of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube without considering the count of cubes with the same value.

To fix this, the program needs to consider both the count of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the count of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube in relation to `k`.
