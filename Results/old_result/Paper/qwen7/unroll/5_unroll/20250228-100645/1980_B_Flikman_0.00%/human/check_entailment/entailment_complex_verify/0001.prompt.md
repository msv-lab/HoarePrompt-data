You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions evaluated for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the loop processes an integer `t` (1 to 1000), followed by `t` sets of data. Each set includes integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The loop calculates the favorite value (the `f`-th element in the list `a`), counts how many elements are equal to the favorite value (`same_value_count`), and counts how many elements are greater than the favorite value (`greater_count`). Based on these counts, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' depending on whether there are at least `k` elements greater than the favorite value or if the sum of elements equal to and greater than the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it determines the `f`-th element in the list `a` as the favorite value. It then counts how many elements in the list are equal to the favorite value and how many are greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, the function prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` which represent the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.
   - It then reads the values of the cubes into the list `a`.

2. **Finding Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The program extracts the value of the favorite cube (`favorite_value`) from the list `a` using the index `f - 1` (since indexing starts at 0).

3. **Counting Same Values:**
   - It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`).

4. **Counting Greater Values:**
   - It counts how many cubes have a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).

5. **Determining Removal:**
   - If the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`) is greater than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely be removed because the first `k` cubes will include all these cubes.
   - If the sum of the cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the cubes with the same value as the favorite cube (`greater_count + same_value_count`) is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be removed because there won't be enough cubes to remove it.
   - Otherwise, the removal of the favorite cube is uncertain and depends on the exact arrangement of the cubes.

### Correctness Check

The logic implemented in the program seems to correctly handle the conditions described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of the conditions:

- **If `greater_count >= k`:**
  - This means there are at least `k` cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube, so the favorite cube will definitely be among the first `k` cubes and thus will be removed.
  - The program prints 'YES' in this case.

- **If `greater_count + same_value_count <= k`:**
  - This means the total number of cubes with a value greater than or equal to the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`. Therefore, the favorite cube will not be among the first `k` cubes and will not be removed.
  - The program prints 'NO' in this case.

- **Otherwise:**
  - The favorite cube might or might not be among the first `k` cubes depending on the exact arrangement of the cubes.
  - The program prints 'MAYBE' in this case.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
