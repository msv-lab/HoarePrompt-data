Output State: The output will be an integer indicating the index `i` (0-based) that minimizes the absolute difference between the number of zeros and ones in the first `i+1` characters and the last `n-i` characters of the string `s`. If there are multiple indices with the same minimum difference, the smallest index is chosen.
