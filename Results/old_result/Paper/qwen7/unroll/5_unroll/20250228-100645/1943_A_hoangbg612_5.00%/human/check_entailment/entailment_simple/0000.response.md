Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the size `S` of the array and the array `N` itself. This is done correctly.

3. **Sorting**: The array `N` is sorted. This step is unnecessary for finding the MEX but is included in the code. Sorting does not affect the MEX calculation directly.

4. **MEX Calculation**:
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in `N`.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - The program iterates through the sorted numbers in `N` and updates `cur` based on the following logic:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the MEX is `cur + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments the count in `M` for that number.
   - After the loop, if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - Finally, it finds the largest number `i` such that the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i` and sets `cur` to that number.

5. **Output**: The program prints the value of `cur` for each test case.

However, there is a flaw in the logic for determining the MEX. The program incorrectly handles the counting and checking process for the MEX. Specifically, it should focus on the unique values and their counts rather than iterating through the sorted array and updating `cur` based on the conditions provided.

The correct approach to find the MEX involves identifying the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the logic:

- Count the frequency of each number in the array.
- Identify the smallest missing number by iterating through the possible values (0 to S-1) and checking if they are present in the array.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        freq = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            freq[num] += 1
        
        cur = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if freq[i] == 0:
                cur = i
            elif freq[i] > 1:
                return 0  # If any number appears more than once, the MEX is 0
        
        print(cur)
```

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the MEX. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
