Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and the list of integers a_i.**

This means the function implicitly accepts a series of test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to the values of `n` and the list of integers `a_i`.
