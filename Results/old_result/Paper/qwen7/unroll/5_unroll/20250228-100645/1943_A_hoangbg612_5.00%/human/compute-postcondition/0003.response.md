Output State: T is an integer input, 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4, and for each input T, the output is the maximum value of `cur` after processing all the lists `N`. The value of `cur` is determined based on the conditions within the loop, and it represents the largest number that satisfies the given constraints for each list `N`.
