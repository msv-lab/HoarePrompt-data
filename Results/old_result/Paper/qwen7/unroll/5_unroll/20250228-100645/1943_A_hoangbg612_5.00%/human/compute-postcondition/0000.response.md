Output State: **T is an integer input, 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4`, the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The other variables (`n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this line of code.
