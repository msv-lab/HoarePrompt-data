Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described. Specifically, the program does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly. Instead, it sorts the array and then tries to determine the MEX based on the sorted array, which does not reflect the game's rules.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

According to the problem description, a possible optimal game could be:
1. Alice picks `1` → `a = [0, 0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
2. Bob picks `0` → `a = [0, 1]`, `c = [1]`.
3. Alice picks `0` → `a = [1]`, `c = [1, 0]`.
4. Bob picks `1` → `a = []`, `c = [1, 0]`.

In this scenario, the MEX of `c = [1, 0]` is `2`. However, the program incorrectly calculates the MEX as `1` because it does not account for the alternating turns and the specific sequence of moves.

The program should simulate the turns explicitly, keeping track of whose turn it is and ensuring that Alice always appends to her list and Bob always removes without appending.
