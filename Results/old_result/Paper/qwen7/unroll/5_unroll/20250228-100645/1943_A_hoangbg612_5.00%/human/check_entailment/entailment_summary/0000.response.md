Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice and Bob's Moves**: The program does not simulate the alternating moves between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. Instead, it processes the entire list of numbers once and tries to determine the MEX based on a sorted list, which is not aligned with the game rules.

2. **Logic for Determining MEX**: The logic used to determine the MEX (`cur`) is flawed. It assumes that the MEX can be determined solely based on the sorted order of the numbers, without considering the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The problem requires both players to play optimally, meaning Alice will try to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it. The provided code does not account for these strategic interactions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly simulate the game or compute the optimal MEX based on the given rules.

Correctness: **False**
