Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements doesn't affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to track the current maximum value that can be excluded.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Processing the Array:**
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop as it means the next number can be excluded.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and increments the count in the dictionary `M` for that number.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - It checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from `0` to `cur` to find the smallest number that is not fully exhausted (`M[i] <= i`), updating `cur` accordingly.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the calculated `cur`.

### Correctness Check

Given the problem statement, we need to ensure that the program correctly simulates the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Here are some key points to verify:

- **Alice's Strategy:** Alice should pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
- **Bob's Strategy:** Bob should pick the largest available number to minimize the MEX.

The program does not simulate the turns explicitly; instead, it processes the array to determine the optimal MEX value. Let's consider the examples provided:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  4
  0 0 1 1
  4
  0 1 2 3
  2
  1 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  1
  0
  ```

#### Analysis:
1. **First Test Case:**
   - Sorted array: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Processing:
     - `cur = -1`, `M = {0: 2, 1: 2}`
     - `cur` is updated to `0` after processing `0` twice.
     - Since `sum(M.values()) == 4`, `cur` is incremented to `1`.
     - `cur` is `1`, and the smallest number not fully exhausted is `0` (as `M[0] == 2 > 0`).
     - Final MEX is `2`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Sorted array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Processing:
     - `cur = -1`, `M = {0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1}`
     - `cur` is updated to `0` after processing `0`.
     - `cur` is `0`, and the smallest number not fully exhausted is `0` (as `M[0] == 1 > 0`).
     - Final MEX is `1`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
   - Processing:
     - `cur = -1`, `M = {1: 2}`
     - `cur` is updated to `1` after processing `1` twice.
     - `cur` is `1`, and the smallest number not fully exhausted is `0` (as `M[0] == 0 <= 0`).
     - Final MEX is `0`.

The program logic matches the expected behavior for these examples.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly calculates the optimal MEX value based on the provided problem description and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
