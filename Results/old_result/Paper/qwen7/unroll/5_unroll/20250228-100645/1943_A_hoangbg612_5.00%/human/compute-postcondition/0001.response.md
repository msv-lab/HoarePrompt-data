State: **`T` must be an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4, inclusive, and `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop condition is based on the value of `T`.
3. For the loop to execute, `T` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4).
4. Since the loop body is omitted, no other states need to be adjusted beyond ensuring `T` meets the required condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `T` to ensure it is within the specified range, and the loop counter `_` is set to 0.
