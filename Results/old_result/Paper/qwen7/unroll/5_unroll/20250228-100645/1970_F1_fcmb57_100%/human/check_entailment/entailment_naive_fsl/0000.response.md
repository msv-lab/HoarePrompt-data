Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where a player throws the Quaffle to their own goal, resulting in the opposing team scoring a point. Specifically, the program checks if the player's position is in the opponent's goal to award a point, but it does not account for the case where the player is carrying the Quaffle and throws it into their own goal, which should result in the opposing team scoring.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
12
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

In this scenario, the red player takes the Quaffle, moves to the right, throws it into their own goal, and the blue player catches the ball and throws it into the red goal. However, the program incorrectly handles the red player throwing the Quaffle into their own goal, and thus does not award the point to the blue team. This is a violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
