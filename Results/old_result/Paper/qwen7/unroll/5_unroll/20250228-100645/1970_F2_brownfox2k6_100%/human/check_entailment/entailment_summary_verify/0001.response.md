Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction provided ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). This is accurate and meets the requirements of the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function processes the game state at a given time step `t`.
   - It correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
   - It prints a message indicating that these players have been eliminated along with the current time step `t`.
   - The function returns a list `out` containing the identifiers of all eliminated players.

However, the original assessment stated that the function does not fully meet the requirement because it only marks players as eliminated instead of removing them from the `player` dictionary. This is a critical point that needs to be addressed.

In the context of the problem, marking players as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]` is sufficient to ensure they are no longer considered active in the game. This is because the main logic of the program will check for the presence of players at valid positions during each step, and players marked as `[-1, -1]` will not be considered active.

Since the function correctly identifies and marks players for elimination, and this marking is sufficient to ensure they are no longer part of the game, the original assessment is overly strict.

Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided function summaries. The function `func_2` correctly handles the elimination of players when they are hit by a Bludger.
