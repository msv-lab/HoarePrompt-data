Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to handle the full logic required for the problem description. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`). However, it does not account for the fact that players and balls can only move within the bounds of the field. The function should ensure that the new position is within the field's dimensions (i.e., `0 <= x < N` and `0 <= y < M`).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function eliminates players who are hit by a Bludger. However, it does not update the player's position or the Bludger's position after elimination. Additionally, it does not handle the scenario where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem description, if a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle remains in the same position. The function should reflect this behavior.

Given these issues, the program does not fully implement the logic required to handle the game's rules, making it incorrect.
