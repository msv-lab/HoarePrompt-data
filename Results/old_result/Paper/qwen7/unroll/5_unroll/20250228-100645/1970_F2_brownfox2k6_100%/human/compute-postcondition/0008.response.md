Functionality: **The function processes the game state at a given time step `t`. It identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger (`blud`) and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints a message indicating that these players have been eliminated along with the current time step `t`. The function returns a list `out` containing the identifiers of all eliminated players.**
