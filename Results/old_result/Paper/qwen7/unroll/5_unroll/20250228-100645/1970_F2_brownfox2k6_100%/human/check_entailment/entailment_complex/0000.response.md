Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function correctly updates the position of the object based on the direction provided. It handles all four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the coordinates accordingly. There are no logical errors in this function.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: The function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated by setting their positions to `[-1, -1]`. It then prints a message for each eliminated player in alphabetical order. The logic for marking and printing is correct.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It processes each action in the game step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle, and checking for scoring and elimination conditions.
   - The scoring and elimination messages are printed in the correct order, and the final score is calculated and displayed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the rules and logic described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
