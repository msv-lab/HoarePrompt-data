The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `obj`, which is a list of two integers representing a position on the field, and a parameter `d`, which is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). Depending on the direction, it updates the position by moving up ('U'), down ('D'), left ('L'), or right ('R'). If the direction is not one of the specified ones, it does not change the position and returns the original position as a list of two integers.
