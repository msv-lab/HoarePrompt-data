Output State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of `b` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive); `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary will be used later to map characters from the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, no changes are made to the existing variables `b` or any other variables, so their states remain unchanged.
