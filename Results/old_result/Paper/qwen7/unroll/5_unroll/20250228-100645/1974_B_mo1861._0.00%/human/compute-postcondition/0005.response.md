Output State: **`char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`. The keys in the dictionary are the unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically, and the values are characters from 'z' down to 'a' corresponding to the position of each character in the reversed sorted order of unique characters in `b'; `s` is an empty string.**

The code `s = ''` initializes an empty string `s`. This does not affect the `char_map` dictionary, which remains unchanged from its initial state.
