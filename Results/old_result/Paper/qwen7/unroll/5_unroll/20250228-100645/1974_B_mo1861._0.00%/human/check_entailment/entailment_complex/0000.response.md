Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly maps each unique character in the encoded string `b` to a character in reverse alphabetical order.
2. The mapping is done using a dictionary `char_map`, where each unique character in `b` is assigned a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
3. The decoding process iterates through each character in `b`, uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding decoded character, and appends it to the resulting string `s`.
4. The function ensures that the decoded string `s` is constructed correctly by reversing the encoding process described in the problem statement.

Given the logic and steps involved, the provided function `func_1` correctly decodes the encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
