Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly decode the string in all cases. Specifically, the issue lies in how the `char_map` is constructed. The current implementation maps each character in the sorted unique set of characters in the encoded string `b` to its symmetric counterpart, but it does not handle the case where the encoded string might contain characters that do not appear in the original string `s`.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "ttt"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` would be `"ft"`, and the decoding process would map `'t'` to both `'f'` and `'t'` (since `'t'` appears twice in `b`). However, the current implementation would map `'t'` to only one character, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the `char_map` should map each character in `r` to two characters in `b` symmetrically, ensuring that each character in `b` is correctly mapped back to its original position in `s`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    for i in range(len(r) // 2 + 1):
        if i == len(r) // 2:
            char_map[r[i]] = b[i * 2]
        else:
            char_map[r[i]] = b[i * 2], b[~i]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map.get(c, char_map[c])
    return s
```

In this corrected version, `char_map` is constructed to handle the symmetric mapping correctly, ensuring that each character in `b` is mapped back to its original position in `s`.
