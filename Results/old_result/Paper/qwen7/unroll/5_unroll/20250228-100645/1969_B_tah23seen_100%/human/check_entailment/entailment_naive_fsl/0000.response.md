Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted state.

For example, consider the string "101011":
- The program would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5, but the optimal solution involves the following steps:
  1. Choose the substring [3, 5]: "101011" -> "101101"
  2. Choose the substring [2, 6]: "101101" -> "011011"
  The total cost is 4 (for the first shift) + 5 (for the second shift) = 9.

The program fails to consider the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts required to sort the string. It instead calculates a cost based on the positions of '0's relative to '1's, which does not always yield the minimum cost.
