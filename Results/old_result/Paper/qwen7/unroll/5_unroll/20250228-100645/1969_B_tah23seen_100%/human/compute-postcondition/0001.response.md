Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0; `one` is 0.**

The code initializes a new variable `one` and sets it to 0. This does not affect the values of `s` or `cost`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial values of `s` and `cost`, while adding the new variable `one` with the value 0.
