Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
2. The provided solution attempts to calculate the cost based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string.
3. The logic in `func_1`:
   - Initializes `cost` to 0.
   - Iterates through the string `s`.
   - Increments `one` for each '1' encountered.
   - When a '0' is encountered after at least one '1', the cost is incremented by `one + 1`.
4. This approach correctly identifies the boundaries where a cyclic shift would be needed to move '1's to the left and '0's to the right.
5. The cost calculation matches the problem's requirements, as each '0' that needs to be moved past '1's will incur a cost equal to the number of '1's plus one.

Given the logic and the problem constraints, the provided function correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

Correctness: **True**
