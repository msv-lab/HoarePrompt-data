Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
2. The provided solution iterates through the string to calculate the cost based on the positions of '1's and '0's.
3. The logic inside `func_1`:
   - It initializes `cost` to 0.
   - It maintains a counter `one` that counts the number of consecutive '1's encountered before a '0'.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `one`.
     - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to `cost`.
4. The logic correctly calculates the cost based on the problem statement. Each time a '0' appears after a sequence of '1's, the cost is incremented by the length of that sequence plus one, which represents the minimal cost to move all '1's to the beginning.
5. The function returns the total cost, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the logic and the implementation, the provided solution correctly computes the minimum cost to sort the binary string.

Correctness: **True**
