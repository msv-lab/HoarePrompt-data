The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Since `num_tests` is given as an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, it already satisfies the condition `num_tests > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is needed.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive**
