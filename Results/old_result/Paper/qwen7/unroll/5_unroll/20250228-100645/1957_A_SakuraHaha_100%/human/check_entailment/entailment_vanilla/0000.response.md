### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of regular polygons (equilateral triangles, squares, pentagons, etc.) that can be formed using the given sticks.
   - Each side of a polygon must be formed by exactly one stick, and no stick can be used more than once.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not process them correctly. It should loop over all test cases, but it only processes the first test case.
   - Inside the loop, the function `func_1()` is called, which is supposed to handle the logic for each test case.
   - In `func_1()`, the program correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length and then calculates how many complete polygons can be formed using these counts.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - For each stick length, it calculates how many complete polygons can be formed by dividing the count by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).
   - This logic is correct for forming equilateral triangles, but it doesn't account for other polygons like squares, pentagons, etc., which require different numbers of sides.

4. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the first test case (`1 1`), the program correctly outputs `0` because there's only one stick and it's not enough to form any polygon.
   - For the second test case (`1 1`), the program also correctly outputs `0`.
   - For the third test case (`2 2 3 3 3 3`), the program correctly outputs `1` because four sticks of length 3 can form one square.
   - For the fourth test case (`4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`), the program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`. It should be able to form one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program is incorrect because it only considers triangles (dividing by 3) and does not generalize to other polygons. Additionally, it only processes the first test case instead of all test cases.

### Correctness:
