To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans`.

1. **`a`**: This is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer. For example, if the input string is "1,2,2,3,3,3", then `a` would be `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.

2. **`cnt`**: This is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`. Continuing with the example above, `cnt` would be `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.

3. **`ans`**: This is the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` divided by 3. Since `cnt` contains the counts of each integer, we need to sum these counts and then divide by 3. In our example, the sum of the counts is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, so `ans` would be `6 / 3 = 2`.

Given this, the print statement `print(ans)` will print the value of `ans`, which is the result of the division of the sum of the counts of each integer in `a` by 3.

Output: **2**
