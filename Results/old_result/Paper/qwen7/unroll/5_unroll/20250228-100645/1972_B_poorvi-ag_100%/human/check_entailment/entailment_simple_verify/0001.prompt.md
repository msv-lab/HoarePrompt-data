You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of 'yes' and 'no' strings, where each string corresponds to whether the count of 'U' in the input string is odd ('yes') or even ('no'). The length of the list is equal to the value of `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The loop will print each string in the list `results` on a new line.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins.
   - The game ends when all coins are removed or when no coins are facing up.
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning they make the best possible move at each turn.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' (up-facing coins) in the string `arr` is odd.
     - If the count of 'U' is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list.
     - Otherwise, it appends 'no' to the results list.
   - Finally, it prints each result from the results list.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in the program is based on the observation that if the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice can force a win by playing optimally.
   - This is because each move reduces the number of up-facing coins by an even number (either 2 or 0), and starting with an odd number of up-facing coins means Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of up-facing coins for Bob.
   - Conversely, if the number of up-facing coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves to ensure he leaves an odd number of up-facing coins for Alice, eventually forcing Alice to lose.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will append 'no' regardless of the value of `arr` since there will be no coins left after the first move.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is 2 correctly, as it will append 'no' if both coins are up-facing, and 'yes' otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of up-facing coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
