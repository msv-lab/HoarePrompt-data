State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `test_case` which iterates over `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The variable `results` is not used in the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list.
