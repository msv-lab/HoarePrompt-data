Output State: **The program returns a list named 'results' containing strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met within each iteration of the loop.**

This means that the program returns the list `results` which was populated during the loop iterations with either 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions evaluated for each test case. Since the exact contents of `results` depend on the `test_cases` and the conditions checked within the loop, the output is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings corresponding to each test case.
