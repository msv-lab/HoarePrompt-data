Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.**
