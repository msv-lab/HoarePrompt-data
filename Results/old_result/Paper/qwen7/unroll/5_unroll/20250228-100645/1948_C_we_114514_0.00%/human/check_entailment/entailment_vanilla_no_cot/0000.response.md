Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the dimensions and the two rows of the grid.
2. **Logic Implementation**: The function `func_1` iterates through each column of the grid and checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row using the arrows. It uses two flags, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row`, to track whether the robot can stay in the first row or move to the second row.
3. **Movement Logic**:
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points to the right (`>`), it checks if it can move to the last column of the first row or if the next column in the second row has an arrow pointing to the right.
   - If the robot reaches the second row, it continues to check if it can move to the end of the second row.
4. **Output**: The program correctly appends 'YES' to the results list if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided solution accurately determines whether the robot can reach the target cell.
