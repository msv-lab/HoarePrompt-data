Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The program calculates the difference between the count of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`. However, the problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty based on the optimal way to split the array `a` derived from the string `s`.

Here's the breakdown of why the program is incorrect:
1. The program does not handle the splitting of the array `a` into subarrays.
2. It does not calculate the penalty for each subarray as defined in the problem statement.
3. The output is simply the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not reflect the penalty calculation.

Given these points, the program does not solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
