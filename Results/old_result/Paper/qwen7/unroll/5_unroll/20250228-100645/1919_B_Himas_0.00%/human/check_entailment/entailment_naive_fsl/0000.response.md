Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and prints their difference. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program would output `8`, but the correct output should be `0`. The optimal split would be `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.

The program fails to handle the optimal splitting logic required to achieve the minimum penalty.
