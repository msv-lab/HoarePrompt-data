### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs their difference, which is not equivalent to the minimum possible penalty.

To properly solve the problem, the program needs to consider the optimal way to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` to minimize the penalty. The penalty is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays multiplied by their lengths. The key insight is that the optimal strategy is to split the array at points where the sum of the subarray becomes zero whenever possible.

Here's how the correct approach would work:
1. Convert the string `s` into an array `a` where '+' is represented as `1` and '-' is represented as `-1`.
2. Iterate through the array `a` and keep track of the cumulative sum.
3. Whenever the cumulative sum becomes zero, split the array at that point.
4. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum them up.

However, the given program does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and outputs their difference, which is not the correct solution.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the optimal strategy to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.
