Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the `func_1` function to perform the required operations.
2. The function first computes the balance of the prefix up to each index in the input string `s` and stores these balances in a dictionary `d`.
3. The dictionary `d` is then sorted by its values, breaking ties by the keys (positions) in descending order.
4. The sorted dictionary is used to construct the output string `ans` by appending characters from the input string `s` in the order specified by the sorted dictionary.
5. The function returns the constructed string `ans`.

Given the problem description and the steps outlined in the annotated program, the logic implemented in `func_1` matches the requirements for performing the balanced shuffle operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
