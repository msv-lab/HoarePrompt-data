Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix up to each position in the string and stores these values in a dictionary `d`.
     - `d[0] = 0` initializes the balance at the start.
     - For each character in the string, it updates the balance in the dictionary.
     - After processing all characters, it removes the entry corresponding to the length of the string (`d.pop(n)`).
   - It sorts the dictionary items by their balance values, breaking ties by position in descending order.
   - It constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Sorting Key:**
   - The sorting key used in `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])` only considers the balance value.
   - According to the problem statement, the sorting should consider both the balance and the position in descending order when there is a tie in balance.
   - The correct sorting key should be `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])`.

2. **Dictionary Keys:**
   - The keys in the dictionary `d` are integer positions starting from 1.
   - However, the positions in the sorted dictionary will be accessed using these keys directly without any adjustments.
   - This might cause issues if the positions are not correctly mapped back to the original string indices.

### Corrected Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {0: 0}
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    # Correct sorting key: balance and position in descending order
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation due to the incorrect sorting key. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
