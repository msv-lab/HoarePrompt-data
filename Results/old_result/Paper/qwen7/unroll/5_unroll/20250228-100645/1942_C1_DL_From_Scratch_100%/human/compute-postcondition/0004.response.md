Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it receives n, x, and y as positive integers (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), y = 0). Additionally, it receives x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function then returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and additional data (vertices), and process them according to the given constraints and requirements, though the exact processing logic isn't detailed here.
