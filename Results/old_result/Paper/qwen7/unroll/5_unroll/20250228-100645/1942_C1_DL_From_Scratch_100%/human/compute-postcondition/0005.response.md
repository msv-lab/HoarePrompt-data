Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it reads values for n, x, and y, along with x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive integers in the list, adjusts this count based on the value of x, and prints the result for each test case. The final output is the sum of these results for all test cases.**
