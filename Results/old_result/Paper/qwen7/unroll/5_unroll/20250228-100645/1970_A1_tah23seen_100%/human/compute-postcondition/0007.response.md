Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list where each element represents the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`, and the last element of `d` is removed.**

Explanation: The code `d.pop(n)` removes the nth element from the list `d`. Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, and list indices are zero-based, `n-1` is the last index of the list `d`. Therefore, the last element of `d` is removed. All other variables remain unchanged.
