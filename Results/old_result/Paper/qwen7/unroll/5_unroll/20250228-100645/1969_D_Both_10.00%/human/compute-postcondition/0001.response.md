Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `val_a`, which is being iterated over `sec_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element. If `sec_arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `sub_summ` is 0.
   - `main_ar` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers (a_i, b_i).

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on `sec_arr` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `sec_arr` is not empty.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `sec_arr` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `main_ar` is a list of tuples, `sec_arr` must have at least one element**
