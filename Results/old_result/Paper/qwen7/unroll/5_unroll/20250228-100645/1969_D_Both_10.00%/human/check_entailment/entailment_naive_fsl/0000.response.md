Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the core logic needed to calculate Alice's optimal profit.

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are placeholders for reading input but do not handle the actual logic of the problem.
2. **Core Logic**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic to maximize Alice's profit. It sums up values without considering the constraints and optimal choices for both Alice and Bob.

Here is a brief outline of what the correct solution should include:
- Read the number of test cases and process each test case separately.
- For each test case, read the values of \(n\) and \(k\).
- Read the arrays \(a_i\) and \(b_i\).
- Identify the items that Alice should buy to maximize her profit, considering the constraints on \(k\).
- Calculate the profit based on the optimal choices made by both Alice and Bob.

Since the provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly, the correctness is **False**.
