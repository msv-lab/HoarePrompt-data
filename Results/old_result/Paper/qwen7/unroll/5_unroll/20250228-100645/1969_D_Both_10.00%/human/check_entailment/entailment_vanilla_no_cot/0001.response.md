Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function is supposed to read an integer from input.
   - `func_2()`: This function is supposed to read multiple integers separated by spaces and return them as a tuple.
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`: This function calculates a sum based on the elements of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - The program uses `func_1()` and `func_2()` to read input, but these functions are not defined in the provided code. Instead, the program directly reads input using `sys.stdin.readline()`. This is fine as long as the input format matches the expected format.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then sorts the pairs `(a[i], b[i])` in descending order based on the difference `b[i] - a[i]`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list and calculates the profit based on the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

### Detailed Explanation of the Main Logic

1. **Sorting the Pairs**:
   - The pairs are sorted in descending order based on the difference `b[i] - a[i]`. This ensures that the items with the highest potential profit (for Alice) are considered first.

2. **Calculating Profit**:
   - If `k == 0`, Alice can buy all items and Bob cannot take any for free, so Alice's profit is the total `b[i]` minus the total `a[i]`.
   - If `k > 0`, Alice should buy items such that Bob takes the `k` most expensive items for free, and Alice keeps the rest. The profit is calculated accordingly.

### Correctness Check

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.readline()`, which is appropriate for this problem.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**:
   - The logic for sorting and calculating the profit is correct. It ensures that Alice maximizes her profit while considering Bob's actions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k == 0` and `k > 0` correctly.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
