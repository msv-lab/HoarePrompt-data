To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions provided can solve the problem correctly according to the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game with `n` items.
   - Each item has prices `a_i` for Alice and `b_i` for Bob.
   - Alice buys a subset of items.
   - Bob can take up to `k` items for free.
   - Alice's profit is calculated as the difference between what Bob pays her and what she spends on the items.

2. **Functions Provided:**
   - `func_1()`: This function returns an integer value from input. It seems to read a single integer from standard input.
   - `func_2()`: This function returns a tuple of integers from input. It seems to read multiple space-separated integers from standard input.
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`: This function calculates a sum based on the input arrays. However, the logic inside the function does not match the problem requirements.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_3`:
- The function `func_3` takes two arrays (`main_ar` and `sec_arr`) as arguments.
- It initializes `sub_summ` to 0.
- It iterates over `sec_arr` and adds the first element of each pair to `sub_summ`.
- It then iterates over `main_ar` and checks if `val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0`. If true, it adds `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` to `sub_summ`.

This function does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
- It does not handle the selection of items for Alice to buy.
- It does not account for Bob taking `k` items for free.
- It does not calculate the optimal profit considering both Alice's and Bob's strategies.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided function `func_3` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
