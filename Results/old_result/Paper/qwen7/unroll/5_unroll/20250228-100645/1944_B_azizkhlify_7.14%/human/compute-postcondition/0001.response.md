Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, it first prints pairs of numbers from the array `a` that appear twice, up to `k` pairs. If there are fewer than `k` pairs found, it then prints any remaining single occurrences of numbers from the array `a`. After that, it prints the same numbers again. If the counts of pairs found in the first half (`l`) and second half (`r`) of the array do not match, it continues to find and print pairs from the second half until the counts match.

In more detail, for each test case:
1. It finds and prints up to `k` pairs of numbers from the first half of the array `a` that appear twice.
2. If there are still required pairs (`k`), it finds and prints the remaining single occurrences from the first half.
3. It prints the same numbers again.
4. If the counts of pairs found in the first half and second half do not match, it continues to find and print pairs from the second half until the counts match.
5. Finally, it prints the numbers found in step 2 again.
