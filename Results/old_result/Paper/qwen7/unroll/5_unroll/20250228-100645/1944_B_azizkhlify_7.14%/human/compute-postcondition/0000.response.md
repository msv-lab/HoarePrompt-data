Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which is used as the range for the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This means that the input value for the loop should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute based on the input value, the state before the loop starts needs to ensure that the input value is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that the input value (which will be read inside the loop) must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
