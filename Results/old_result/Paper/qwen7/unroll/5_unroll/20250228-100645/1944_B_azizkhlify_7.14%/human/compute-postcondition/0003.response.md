Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by t (a positive integer between 1 and 5000), n (an integer between 2 and 50000), k (an integer between 1 and ⌊n/2⌋), and an array a of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and an array `a`. For each test case, the function processes the array `a` and returns a result based on the specified conditions involving `n`, `k`, and the structure of the array `a`.
