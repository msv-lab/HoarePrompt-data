Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' printed for each iteration where the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' printed for each iteration where the sum is odd. Since the values of `a` and `b` are determined by user input within the loop, the exact output cannot be predicted without knowing the specific inputs provided during each iteration.
