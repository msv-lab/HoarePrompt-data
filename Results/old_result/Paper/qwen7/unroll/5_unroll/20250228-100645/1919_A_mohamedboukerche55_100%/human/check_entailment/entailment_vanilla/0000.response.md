### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet in each turn. The player who cannot make a valid move loses.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner. If the total number of coins is even, Bob wins; if it is odd, Alice wins. This is because:
   - When the total number of coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he is the last to make a move.
   - When the total number of coins is odd, Alice can always be the last to make a move, ensuring she wins.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains the values of `a` and `b` separated by a space.
   - It splits the string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`.
   - It checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and prints 'Bob' or 'Alice' accordingly.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies whether the total number of coins is even or odd.
   - Based on the parity of the total number of coins, it correctly determines the winner.
   - However, the code assumes that the input format is exactly as expected (i.e., a single line per test case with space-separated values).

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
