### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Objective**: Determine the winner based on the optimal strategy of both players.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After swapping, each player removes 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
3. **Key Insight**: The game essentially reduces to a series of moves where each player tries to force the opponent into a losing position. The optimal strategy involves parity (even or odd sums).

#### Program Analysis:
- The program reads `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b` (number of coins Alice and Bob have respectively).
- It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Alice".

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Initial Sum Parity**: The program checks the parity of the initial sum of `a` and `b`.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The game involves strategic exchanges, but the program does not simulate these exchanges. Instead, it makes a decision based on the initial sum.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1 (`1 1`)**:
  - Initial sum: 1 + 1 = 2 (even)
  - According to the program, Bob wins.
  - **Analysis**: This is correct because if Alice swaps, she ends up with 0 coins, and Bob wins. If Alice keeps her wallet, she still ends up with 0 coins after Bob's turn.

- **Test Case 2 (`1 4`)**:
  - Initial sum: 1 + 4 = 5 (odd)
  - According to the program, Alice wins.
  - **Analysis**: This is also correct because Alice can swap, and then Bob will be forced to swap back, leading to Alice winning as described in the problem statement.

- **General Case**:
  - If the sum is even, Bob wins because Alice can always swap to force Bob into a losing position.
  - If the sum is odd, Alice wins because she can always swap to force Bob into a losing position.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic that the player whose turn it is when the sum of coins is even will lose. This is because the player can always swap to force the opponent into a losing position. The program does not need to simulate the entire game; it can directly determine the winner based on the initial sum's parity.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given examples.
