You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

    return frequency_table

    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
        
    #State: Output State: The `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a number from the list `arr` and its value is the maximum of the occurrences of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.
    return frequency_table

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Handling Edge Case:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot form a group of `k` cards, you cannot perform any operations, and thus, the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in the list.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. It reduces the count of any card number to `k` if its frequency exceeds `k`. This does not align with the problem statement, which allows exchanging `k` cards for `k-1` new cards but does not restrict the frequency of card numbers.

4. **Determining Minimum Cards:**
   - After calling `func_1`, the program checks if `k` is present in the frequency table.
     - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. This logic is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of further reductions in the number of cards.
     - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards through multiple operations.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible operations.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the number of full groups of k cards
    full_groups = sum(f // k for f in frequency_table.values())
    
    # Calculate the remaining cards
    remaining_cards = n - full_groups * (k - 1)
    
    print(remaining_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Count Frequencies:**
   - We count the frequency of each card number using a dictionary.

2. **Calculate Full Groups:**
   - We calculate the number of full groups of `k` cards that can be formed by summing up `f // k` for each frequency `f`.

3. **Calculate Remaining Cards:**
   - The remaining cards are calculated as `n - full_groups * (k - 1)`.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and the incorrect handling of the remaining cards. The corrected program accurately implements the solution based on the problem description.
