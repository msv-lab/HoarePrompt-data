Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Details**: For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the number of cards to exchange `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If `k > n`, the program prints `n`, which is correct because no exchanges can be made.
4. **Frequency Calculation**: The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table. This function correctly calculates the maximum count of each number in `nums`, capping it at `k`.
5. **Final Output Determination**:
   - If `k` appears in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because the problem asks for the minimum number of cards left, not the number of cards that can be exchanged.
   - If `k` does not appear in the frequency table, it prints `n`, which is also incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of reducing the number of cards further.

Given the logic in the final output determination, the program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic should focus on finding the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the given operations.

Correctness: **False**
