Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`). The function `func_1` accurately computes the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired configuration, and returns the maximum of these two values, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations needed. The logic is sound and matches the problem description.
