Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
2. The operations include adding a cat to a box, removing a cat from a box, or moving a cat from one box to another.
3. The proposed solution correctly identifies the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) and the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`).
4. The logic in `func_1` calculates these values:
   - `cats_to_add` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'.
   - `cats_to_remove` is the count of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
5. The function then returns the maximum of these two counts, which correctly represents the minimum number of operations needed because:
   - Each addition or removal operation counts as one operation.
   - Moving a cat from one box to another also counts as one operation.
   - The maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove` ensures that all necessary additions and removals are accounted for.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution accurately computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state.

Correctness: **True**
