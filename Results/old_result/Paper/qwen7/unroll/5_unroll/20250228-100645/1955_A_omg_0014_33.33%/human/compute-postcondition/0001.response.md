State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 within the `range(n)` function call.
2. The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition or initialization, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `i` (which is set to 0 at the start of each iteration).
