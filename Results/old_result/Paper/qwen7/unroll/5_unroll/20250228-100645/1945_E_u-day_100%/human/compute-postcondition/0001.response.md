Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. Since the initial values of `n` and `k` are determined by the function `func_1()`, they remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated variable `arr` which now holds the result of `func_2()`.
