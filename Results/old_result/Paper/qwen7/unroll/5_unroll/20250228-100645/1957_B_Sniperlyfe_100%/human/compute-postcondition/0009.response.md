Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns a list `nums` of length `n`. The first element `nums[0]` is set to `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being decremented by the value of `nums[i]` during each iteration.**
