Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is equal to ((1 << (`k`'s bit length)) - 1) - 1, and for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is equal to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being reduced accordingly for each iteration.
