Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros; `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[0]` which is ((1 << (`k`'s bit length)) - 1) - 1.**

Explanation: The code `k -= nums[0]` subtracts the value of `nums[0]` from `k`. Given that `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (`k`'s bit length) - 1) - 1`, this value is subtracted from `k`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.
