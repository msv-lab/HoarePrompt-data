Output State: The output state will consist of strings printed during each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. For each value of `i` from 0 to `t-1`, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input. If `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'; if `a < b > c`, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The output state will be a sequence of these strings, one for each iteration of the loop.
