Output State: The output state will consist of multiple strings printed based on the given conditions. For each iteration of the outer loop, if `k` is 1, it will print `n` times the string containing all characters from 'a' to 'z'. If `k` is greater than 1, it will print `(2 - (n == 1))` times the string containing all characters from 'a' to the character corresponding to `k` in the alphabet.
