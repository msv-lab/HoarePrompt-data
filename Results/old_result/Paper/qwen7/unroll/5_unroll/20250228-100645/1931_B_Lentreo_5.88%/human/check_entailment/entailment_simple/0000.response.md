### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the operation can only be performed from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index.

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), it is always possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water evenly. This is because the total amount of water can be divided equally among all containers.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.
   - It then calculates the difference between each element (except the last one) and the last element in the list.
   - If the cumulative sum of these differences is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Given Code**:
   - The logic in the given code is flawed. It does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed.
   - The code calculates the difference between each element and the last element, but this does not reflect the actual distribution of water among all containers.
   - The correct approach would be to check if the average amount of water per container (total water / n) can be achieved by pouring water from higher-indexed containers to lower-indexed ones.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the average amount of water per container.
   - Check if the water can be evenly distributed by comparing the sum of water in all containers to `n` times the average.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
