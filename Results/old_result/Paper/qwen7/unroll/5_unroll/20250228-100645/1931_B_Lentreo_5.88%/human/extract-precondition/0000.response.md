Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and there are n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
