Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the cumulative sum of the differences between each non-zero element (excluding the last one) and the last element in the list is zero. However, this approach does not correctly address the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers. This means that the average amount of water per container should be an integer. Here's why the current approach is incorrect:

1. The program calculates the difference between each element and the last element, which does not reflect the overall distribution of water.
2. The condition `if curr == 0` only checks if the cumulative sum of these differences is zero, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement of equalizing the water in all containers.

A correct approach would be to calculate the total amount of water and check if it is divisible by the number of containers. If it is, then it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        total_water = sum(nums)
        
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected function correctly checks if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

Given the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
