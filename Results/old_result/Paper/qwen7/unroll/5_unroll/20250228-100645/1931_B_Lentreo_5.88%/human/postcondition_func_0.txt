The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of cases, followed by `n` integers. It then calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between each non-zero element (excluding the last one) and the last element in the list. If this cumulative sum equals zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the specified condition.
