Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of containers.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the amount of water in each container.

2. **Key Logic:**
   - The program calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each other element (`i`) in the list.
   - It sums these differences into `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Problem Understanding:
- We need to check if we can make all containers have the same amount of water using the allowed operations.
- The key insight here is that the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, so the target amount of water per container would be the total amount divided by `n`.

#### Program Logic:
- The program attempts to check if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero.
- This approach is flawed because:
  - It only considers the difference between each element and the last element, not the overall distribution.
  - It doesn't ensure that the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`:
  - The total amount of water is `15`, and `15 % 5 == 0`, so the target amount per container is `3`.
  - However, the program checks differences against the last element `3` instead of checking if the total can be evenly distributed.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among all containers. The program fails to consider the overall distribution of water and only checks differences against the last element.

### Correctness: **False**
