Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array \(a\) of length \(n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided code initializes \(a[0]\) to 500 and sets \(a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]\) for \(1 \leq i < n\). This approach does not guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) will hold true for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

For example, consider the test case:
- \(n = 4\)
- \(x = [2, 4, 1]\)

If we follow the provided code:
- \(a[0] = 500\)
- \(a[1] = 500 + 2 = 502\)
- \(a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506\)
- \(a[3] = 506 + 1 = 507\)

Now, let's check the modulo conditions:
- \(x_2 = 2\), but \(502 \bmod 500 = 2\), which is correct.
- \(x_3 = 4\), but \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\), which is correct.
- \(x_4 = 1\), but \(507 \bmod 506 = 1\), which is correct.

However, this solution is not unique, and other valid solutions exist. For instance, another valid solution could be:
- \(a[0] = 500\)
- \(a[1] = 502\)
- \(a[2] = 502 + 4 = 506\)
- \(a[3] = 506 - 1 = 505\)

Here, \(505 \bmod 506 = 505 \bmod 506 = 1\), which also satisfies the condition.

Given that the provided code does not ensure the modulo conditions are met for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\), the solution is not always correct.

Correctness: **False**
