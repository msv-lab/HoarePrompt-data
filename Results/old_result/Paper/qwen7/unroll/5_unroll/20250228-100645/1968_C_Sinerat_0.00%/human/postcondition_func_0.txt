The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( t \), and a list \( x \) of \( n-1 \) integers. It then calculates a list \( a \) of length \( n \) where \( a[0] = 500 \) and \( a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1] \) for \( 1 \leq i < n \). Finally, it prints the list \( a \) for each test case.
