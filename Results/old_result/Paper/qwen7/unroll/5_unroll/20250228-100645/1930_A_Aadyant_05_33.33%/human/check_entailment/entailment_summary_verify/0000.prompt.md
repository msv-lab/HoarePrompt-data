You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t and an integer n, along with 2n integers. For each test case, it calculates the sum of every second element from the input list, sorts these sums, and then prints each sum. The final output is a series of printed sums corresponding to each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers and adding the minimum of the pair to the score. However, the program does not properly handle the pairing and selection process.

Specifically, the program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads a number `a`, which seems to be a single integer rather than the total number of integers on the whiteboard (which is `2n`). It then reads another integer `b` and splits it into a list, but it does not sort the list or correctly pair and sum the minimum values of each pair.

Here is an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
1
2
2 4
```

The expected output should be 2 because the optimal strategy is to choose the smallest pair (2, 4) and add the minimum value (2) to the score.

However, the program will read `a` as 2 and `b` as "2 4". It will split `b` into a list but will not sort it or correctly pair the elements. Instead, it will simply take the first element (2) and add it to the output list, resulting in an output of 2. This is correct for this specific example, but the program fails to handle the general case correctly.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the list of numbers and then summing the minimum values of each pair. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = sorted([int(data[index + i]) for i in range(2 * n)])
        index += 2 * n
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly sorts the numbers and sums the minimum values of each pair, ensuring the maximum score is achieved.
