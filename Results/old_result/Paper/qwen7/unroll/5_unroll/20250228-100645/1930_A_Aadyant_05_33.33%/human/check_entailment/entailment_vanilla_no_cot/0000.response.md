Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program expects the number of test cases (`num`) as an input, but the problem statement specifies that the first line should contain the number of test cases (`t`), not `num`. This mismatch means the program won't work as expected for multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, the program reads an integer `a`, which should actually be `n` (half the number of elements on the whiteboard). It then reads a string of space-separated integers and splits them into a list. However, it incorrectly processes these integers by only considering every other element starting from the second index (i.e., `list1[2*i]`). This approach does not maximize the score because it ignores the smallest elements.

3. **Sorting and Summing**: The program sorts the list of integers and then sums up every other element starting from the first one. This is not the optimal strategy. To maximize the score, we should pair the smallest available integers together in each step.

4. **Output**: The program prints the sum of selected elements for each test case, but it doesn't ensure that the pairs chosen are optimal to maximize the score.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the value of `n` and the list of integers.
- Sort the list of integers.
- Pair the smallest available integers in each step to maximize the score.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_score(n, numbers):
    numbers.sort()
    score = 0
    while numbers:
        # Take the smallest two numbers and add the smaller one to the score
        score += min(numbers.pop(0), numbers.pop(0))
    return score

def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        results.append(max_score(n, numbers))
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program reads all inputs at once, processes each test case correctly, and ensures the optimal pairing to maximize the score.
