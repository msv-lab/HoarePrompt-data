Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not actually perform the operations described in the problem statement (i.e., breaking down numbers into their constituent digits).
2. Instead, the program checks if the list is already sorted and prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on that check. This does not account for the possibility of transforming the list through the specified operations.
3. The function `func_1` simply checks if the list is sorted, which is not sufficient to determine if the list can be transformed into a sorted list via the allowed operations.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
