### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### 1. Input Parsing:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

#### 2. Main Logic:
- The program iterates through the array starting from the second element (`p`).
- It checks if the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and if the previous element is at least 10.
- If both conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element and inserting its digits back into the array.

#### 3. Sorting Check:
- After potentially performing the operation, the program checks if the array is sorted using the `func_1(lst)` function.
- If the array is sorted, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Operation Implementation**:
   - The operation is supposed to split an element that is at least 10 and insert its digits back into the array.
   - The program attempts to perform this operation but does so incorrectly. Specifically, it removes the element and inserts the digits at the wrong positions.

2. **Sorting Check**:
   - The `func_1(lst)` function checks if the array is sorted, which is a necessary part of the solution.
   - However, the operation of splitting and inserting digits is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     4
     12 3 45 67
     ```
   - The correct approach would be to split the elements as follows:
     - Split `12` to `[1, 2]`.
     - Split `45` to `[4, 5]`.
     - Split `67` to `[6, 7]`.

   - After splitting, the array would become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.
   - However, the provided program does not perform these splits and instead checks if the original array is sorted, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Function `func_1(lst)`**:
   - This function correctly checks if the array is sorted.
   - However, it does not account for the possibility of the array being transformed by the operation.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic. It fails to handle the transformation of elements properly and instead checks if the original array is sorted, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
