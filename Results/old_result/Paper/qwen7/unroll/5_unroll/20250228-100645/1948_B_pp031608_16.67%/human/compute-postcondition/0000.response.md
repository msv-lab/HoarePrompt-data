Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a sorted version of `lst`**.

The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged in terms of its contents, but it is now referenced through `sorted_lst`. The length and range of the elements in `lst` remain the same as the initial state.
