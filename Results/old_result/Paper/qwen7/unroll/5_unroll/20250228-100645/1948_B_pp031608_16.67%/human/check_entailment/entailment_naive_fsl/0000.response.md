Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the process of splitting elements that are at least 10 and inserting their digits back into the array. Instead, it checks if the array is sorted after performing an incorrect operation. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program attempts to perform the operation inside the `for` loop but does so incorrectly. It checks if `func_1(list1)` returns `False`, which is not the intended logic. Additionally, the operation of splitting the element and inserting its digits is not implemented correctly.

2. **Sorting Check**: The program uses a function `func_1(lst)` to check if the list is sorted. However, this function does not account for the possibility of the array being transformed by the operation. The transformation involves splitting elements and reinserting their digits, which is not reflected in the sorting check.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   3
   4
   12 3 45 67
   ```
   The correct approach would be to split the elements as follows:
   - Split `12` to `[1, 2]`.
   - Split `45` to `[4, 5]`.
   - Split `67` to `[6, 7]`.

   After splitting, the array would become `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted. However, the provided program does not perform these splits and instead checks if the original array is sorted, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle the transformation of elements properly, making it incorrect.
