Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even.

3. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Reasoning:

- **Initial Conditions**:
  - The tower starts with 0 cubes.
  - Each move either adds 1 cube or removes 1 cube.

- **Key Insight**:
  - To end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of additions must be exactly `m` more than the number of removals.
  - Let \( a \) be the number of additions and \( r \) be the number of removals. Then, \( a + r = n \) and \( a - r = m \).
  - Solving these equations, we get \( a = \frac{n + m}{2} \) and \( r = \frac{n - m}{2} \).

- **Conditions for Validity**:
  - Both \( a \) and \( r \) must be non-negative integers.
  - This means \( n + m \) must be even (so \( a \) is an integer), and \( n - m \) must be even (so \( r \) is an integer).

### Verification of the Program:

- The program correctly checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
- These conditions ensure that the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in exactly `m` cubes.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
