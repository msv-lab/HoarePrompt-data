### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- **Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
- **Key Conditions**:
  - `n` must be greater than or equal to `m` because you need at least `m` moves to potentially end up with `m` cubes.
  - The difference `(n - m)` must be even because every addition and removal of cubes must balance out to end up with `m` cubes.

#### Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotations:
- **Initial State**: `t` is the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`.
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, `n` and `m` are read and checked against the conditions.
- **Conditions Checked**:
  - `n >= m`: Ensures there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
  - `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: Ensures the difference is even, allowing for balanced additions and removals.

#### Evaluation:
1. **Condition `n >= m`**:
   - This condition ensures that there are sufficient moves to potentially end up with `m` cubes.
   
2. **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**:
   - This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, meaning the number of additions and removals can be balanced to achieve `m` cubes.

Given these conditions, the program correctly checks if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
