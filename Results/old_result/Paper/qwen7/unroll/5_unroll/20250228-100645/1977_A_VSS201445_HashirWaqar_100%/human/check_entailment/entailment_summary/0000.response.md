Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking two conditions:
1. `n >= m`: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially achieve the desired number of cubes.
2. `(n - m) % 2 == 0`: This ensures that the difference between the total moves and the target number of cubes is even. This condition is necessary because each pair of moves (one put and one remove) results in no net change in the number of cubes, and thus the difference must be even to achieve the exact number of cubes.

Given these conditions, the logic correctly determines whether it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program iterates over each test case, applies these conditions, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Since the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
