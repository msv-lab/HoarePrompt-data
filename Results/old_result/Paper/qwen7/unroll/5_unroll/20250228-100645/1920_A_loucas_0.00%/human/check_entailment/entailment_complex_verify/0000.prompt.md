You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each value of `loop`, the output will be the smallest integer greater than any element in `big` and less than any element in `less`, excluding any elements in `no`. If no such integer exists, the output will be undefined for that iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x). The function then determines and prints the smallest integer greater than any element in the 'big' list and less than any element in the 'less' list, excluding any elements in the 'no' list. If no such integer exists, the output for that test case is undefined.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all the constraints. Specifically, the program attempts to find a single integer \( k \) within the range defined by the maximum value in `big` and the minimum value in `less`, excluding the values in `no`. However, this approach is flawed because it only returns the first valid \( k \) found, rather than counting all valid \( k \) values.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
1 3
2 10
3 1
3 5
```
According to the problem description, the valid \( k \) values should be \( 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \). The program should output 7, but instead, it will output 3 because it finds the first valid \( k \) (which is 3) and stops.

To fix this, the program needs to count all valid \( k \) values within the range defined by the constraints, rather than just finding the first one.
