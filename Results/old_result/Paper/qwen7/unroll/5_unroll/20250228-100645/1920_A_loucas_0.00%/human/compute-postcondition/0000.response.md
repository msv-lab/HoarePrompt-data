Output State: **`loop` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500.**

The code `loop = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `loop`. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the new assignment updates `loop` with the input value while keeping the constraint 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500 intact. The other variables (`n` and the constraints) are not affected by this code.
