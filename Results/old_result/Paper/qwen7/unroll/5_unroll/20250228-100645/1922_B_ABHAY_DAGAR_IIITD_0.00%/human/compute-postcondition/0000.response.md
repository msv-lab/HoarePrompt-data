Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The initial state of `test_cases` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `results` and retains the original structure and content of `test_cases`.
