You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of all n values across all tuples does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        num_of_lens = {}
        
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        
        res = 0
        
        total_count = 0
        
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        
        results.append(res)
        
    #State: Output State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the calculated result based on the operations performed inside the loop for each corresponding test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state will be a series of printed lines, each containing an integer from the `results` list, corresponding to the calculated result for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The function returns a result based on the given test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
