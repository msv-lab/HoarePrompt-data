Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and after executing the loop, the output consists of either '2' or '3' printed for each test case based on the conditions inside the loop. If there exists an index `i` where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, then '2' is printed; otherwise, '3' is printed.
