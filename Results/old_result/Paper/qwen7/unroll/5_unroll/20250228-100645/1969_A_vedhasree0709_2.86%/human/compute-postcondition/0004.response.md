Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) and a list \( l \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it checks if there exists an index \( i \) such that \( l[i] = i + 2 \) and \( l[i + 1] = i + 1 \). If such an index exists, it prints '2'; otherwise, it prints '3'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
