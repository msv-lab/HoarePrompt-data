Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program assumes that the sequence `l` will always contain consecutive elements that satisfy the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`. However, this is not a general solution and fails to consider other valid configurations of the input list.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1
```
In this case, the program will output `2`, which is incorrect because Monocarp needs to invite both friends 1 and 2 to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The correct output should be `2`.

Another example is:
```
4
2 3 4 1
```
The program will also output `2`, but the correct output should be `3` as explained in the example in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and thus is incorrect.
