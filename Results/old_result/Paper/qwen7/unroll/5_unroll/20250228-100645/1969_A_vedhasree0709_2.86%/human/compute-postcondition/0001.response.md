Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and after executing the loop, if there exists an index i where l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1, the output will be 2 for that test case; otherwise, the output will be 3 for that test case.
