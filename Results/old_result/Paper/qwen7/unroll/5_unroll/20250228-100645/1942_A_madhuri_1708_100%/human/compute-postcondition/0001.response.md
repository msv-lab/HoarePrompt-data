Output State: The output will consist of lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case:
- If \( k \geq 2 \):
  - If \( n = k \), the line will contain \( k \) occurrences of \( k \).
  - Otherwise, the line will contain \(-1\).
- If \( k < 2 \), the line will contain \( n \) consecutive integers starting from 1.

Since the exact values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case are not provided, the output will vary based on the input given.
