Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case count `t`, followed by `t` groups of `n` integers in a list `a`. For each group, it checks if all integers in the list `a` are within the range 1 to 10^6, inclusive, and returns `True` if all conditions are met for all groups; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
