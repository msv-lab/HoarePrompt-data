You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a sequence of numbers based on the initial number in the list and the subsequent numbers, updating the last number in the sequence iteratively. After processing all test cases, it writes the final calculated number for each test case to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings.
   - The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
   - This calculation is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which essentially finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Updating `last_year`**:
   - After calculating the next year, it updates `last_year` to this value.

5. **Storing Results**:
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list.

6. **Outputting Results**:
   - Finally, it joins the results list into a single string and writes it to stdout.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's compare the logic with the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - `n = 6`, `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Calculation steps:
    - First sign: Year 3
    - Second sign: Year 4
    - Third sign: Year 8
    - Fourth sign: Year 10
    - Fifth sign: Year 18
    - Sixth sign: Year 36
  - Output: `36`

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Calculation steps:
    - First sign: Year 1
    - Second sign: Year 2
    - Third sign: Year 3
    - Fourth sign: Year 4
    - Fifth sign: Year 5
  - Output: `5`

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - `n = 5`, `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Calculation steps:
    - All signs occur in the same year: Year 1
  - Output: `5` (Note: The expected output should be `1`)

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - `n = 6`, `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Calculation steps:
    - First sign: Year 50
    - Second sign: Year 50 + 1 + 30 - 1 = 79
    - Third sign: Year 79 + 1 + 711 - 1 = 789
    - Fourth sign: Year 789 + 1 + 200 - 1 = 988
    - Fifth sign: Year 988 + 1 + 503 - 1 = 1491
    - Sixth sign: Year 1491 + 1 + 1006 - 1 = 2496
  - Output: `2012` (Note: The expected output should be `2496`)

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the year for the nth sign based on the given periodicities. However, the output for some test cases does not match the expected results. Specifically, the output for the third test case should be `1` instead of `5`, and the output for the fourth test case should be `2496` instead of `2012`.

Therefore, the program is almost correct but has issues with the output for certain test cases.
