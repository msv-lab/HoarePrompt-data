Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input values for each test case and processes them according to the problem statement.
2. The program initializes `T` (number of test cases), and for each test case, it reads `n` (number of signs) and the list `a` of periodicities.
3. The logic inside the loop correctly calculates the year when the nth sign will occur:
   - It starts with `last_year` as the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which ensures the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than the previous year.
   - This calculation is correct because it finds the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
4. The results are stored in a list and written to the standard output in the correct format.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
