The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a sequence of numbers based on the initial number in the list and the subsequent numbers, updating the last number in the sequence iteratively. After processing all test cases, it writes the final calculated number for each test case to the standard output.
