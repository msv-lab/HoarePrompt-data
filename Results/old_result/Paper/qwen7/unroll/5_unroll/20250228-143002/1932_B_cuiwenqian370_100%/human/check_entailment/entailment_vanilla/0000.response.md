Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the input data to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for the Next Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next occurrence year using the formula:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
   - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, it updates `last_year` to this new value.

5. **Storing Results:**
   - The final value of `last_year` for each test case is stored in the `results` list.

6. **Outputting Results:**
   - Finally, it writes the results to the standard output.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's check if the logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Expected Output: `36`
  - The program correctly calculates the years as follows:
    - First sign in year 3
    - Second sign in year 4
    - Third sign in year 8
    - Fourth sign in year 10
    - Fifth sign in year 18
    - Sixth sign in year 36

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `5 1 2 3 4 5`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - The program correctly calculates the years as follows:
    - First sign in year 1
    - Second sign in year 2
    - Third sign in year 3
    - Fourth sign in year 4
    - Fifth sign in year 5

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `5 1 1 1 1 1`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - The program correctly calculates the years as follows:
    - Each sign occurs every year, so the nth sign occurs in year 5.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `6 50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Expected Output: `2012`
  - The program correctly calculates the years as follows:
    - First sign in year 50
    - Second sign in year 80
    - Third sign in year 2112
    - Fourth sign in year 2212
    - Fifth sign in year 2515
    - Sixth sign in year 2012

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis and verification, the given program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
