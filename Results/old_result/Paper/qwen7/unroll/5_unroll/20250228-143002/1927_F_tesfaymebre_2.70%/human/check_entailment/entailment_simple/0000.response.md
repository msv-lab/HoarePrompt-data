Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to iterate over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`) and the number of edges (`m`).
3. It constructs the graph using an adjacency list representation and a list of edges.
4. It sorts the edges in descending order of their weights.
5. It uses a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure to detect cycles in the graph.
6. During the cycle detection process, it keeps track of the minimum weight edge that forms a cycle.
7. After identifying the cycle, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) to trace the cycle and prints the required output.

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the program appears to be designed to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight edge for each test case. The logic seems sound and follows the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
