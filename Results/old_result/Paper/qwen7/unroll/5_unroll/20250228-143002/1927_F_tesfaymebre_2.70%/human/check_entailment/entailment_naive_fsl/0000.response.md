Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify a simple cycle with the minimal weight of the lightest edge. Specifically, the program uses a union-find data structure to find cycles but does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., it does not visit the same vertex more than once).

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider a graph with 4 vertices and 4 edges:
- Edge 1: (1, 2, 2)
- Edge 2: (2, 3, 2)
- Edge 3: (3, 4, 2)
- Edge 4: (4, 1, 3)

The program will correctly identify that the minimum weight of the lightest edge is 2. However, it will incorrectly find a cycle involving all four vertices (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), which is not a simple cycle because it revisits vertex 1.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the cycle found is simple. This can be achieved by maintaining a visited array or set to track the vertices visited during the DFS traversal and ensuring no vertex is revisited within the same cycle.
