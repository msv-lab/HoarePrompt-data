Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `q` where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries each defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the borders of the subarray. For each query, it checks if the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" and returns a list of boolean values indicating whether each subarray is good or not.**

Note: The term "good" is not defined in the provided information, so the functionality description assumes it needs to be checked according to some predefined criteria which is not specified here.
