Functionality: **The function processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `q` where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array `a` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries each defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the borders of the subarray. For each query, it checks if the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" and prints 'YES' if the subarray is good, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output based on the queries.**
