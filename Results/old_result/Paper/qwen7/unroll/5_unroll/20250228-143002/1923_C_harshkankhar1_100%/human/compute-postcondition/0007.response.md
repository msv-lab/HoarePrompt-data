To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects mentioned in the loop head. The loop head here is simply `for _ in range(q):`, which means the loop will execute `q` times. 

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head does not explicitly mention any variables, but it implies that the loop will iterate `q` times. Therefore, the key variable to consider is `q`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `q` must be at least 1. This is because the loop will run for `q` iterations, and if `q` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`a`, `b`, `n`, and `t`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

### Conclusion:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `q` must be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
