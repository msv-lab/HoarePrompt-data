The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` with a length between 2 and 50, inclusive, and each element in the list is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. It checks if any element in the list is greater than the next element. If such an element is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.
