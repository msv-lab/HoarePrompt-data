Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `int(data[0])` to `t`. Since `index` was initially 0, after executing the line of code, `index` is incremented by 1 (though not explicitly shown in the code, this is the typical behavior when using `int()` on a list element). The value of `data` and the initial value of `index` are updated accordingly.
