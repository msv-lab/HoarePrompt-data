Output State: **`index` is 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string at spaces, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the values of `n` and `arr` are yet to be determined based on the subsequent input.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
