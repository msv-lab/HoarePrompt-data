Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. `arr` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array `a`. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string.**

This line of code replaces the default `input()` function with `sys.stdin.read()`, which reads the entire input as a single string. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
