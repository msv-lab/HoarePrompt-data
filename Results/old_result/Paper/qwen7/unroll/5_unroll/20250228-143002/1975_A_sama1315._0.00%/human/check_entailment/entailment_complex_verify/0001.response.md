### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. `func_1` should check if the array is already non-decreasing. If not, it should use `func_2` to process multiple test cases.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one.
     - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
     - If no such pair exists, it returns 'Yes'.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function should return 'Yes' only if the array is already sorted. If there is even one pair where the current element is greater than the next one, the function should return 'No'. The current implementation incorrectly returns 'Yes' when there is at least one pair where the current element is greater than the next one, which is the opposite of what the problem requires.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It reads the total number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct and processes the test cases as required.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - `func_1` incorrectly identifies if an array can be sorted by a single swap operation. It should return 'No' if there is even one pair where the current element is greater than the next one.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem statement and the implementation, the functions are not correct because `func_1` has a logical error in its implementation.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
