Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string at spaces, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, and the values of `n` and `arr` are yet to be determined based on the subsequent input.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads the entire input as a single string and splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `n` and `arr` will be determined later based on the input provided after this line.
