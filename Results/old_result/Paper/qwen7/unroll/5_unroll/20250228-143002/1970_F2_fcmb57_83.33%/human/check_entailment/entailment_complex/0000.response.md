Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field dimensions \(N\) and \(M\).
   - It parses the field representation and stores the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - The initial setup of the field and parsing of the input seems correct.

2. **Movement Logic**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly computes the new position of an entity based on the direction provided.
   - The logic for handling movements, catching the Quaffle, and throwing the Quaffle appears to be implemented correctly within the loop that processes each step of the game.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - The elimination logic is also implemented correctly, ensuring that players are removed from the field when they are hit by a Bludger.
   - The order of printing events (scoring and eliminations) is maintained correctly.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score is calculated and printed correctly at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the rules and logic specified in the problem statement accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
