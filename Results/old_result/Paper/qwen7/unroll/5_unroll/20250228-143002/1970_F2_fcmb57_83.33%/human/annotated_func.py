#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N strings in total. The list also includes the number of steps T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) and a series of actions for each step, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x + b[0] and y + b[1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is ignored, and parameter `b` is expected to be a pair of integers `[dx, dy]`. The function calculates and returns a new pair of integers `[x + dx, y + dy]`, where `x` and `y` are derived from `a` but `a` itself is not used in the calculation.
