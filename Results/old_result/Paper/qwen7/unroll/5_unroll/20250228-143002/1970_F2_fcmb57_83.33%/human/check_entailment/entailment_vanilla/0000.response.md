Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly initializes the dimensions of the field and parses the input to identify players, goals, and the initial position of the Quaffle.
   - The `players` dictionary is used to store the positions of players, and `goals` dictionary stores the positions of goals for each team.
   - The `quidditch` variable is initialized to store the position of the Quaffle and whether it is being carried.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of players using the `func_1` function, which updates their positions based on the direction specified.
   - The program checks for collisions with Bludgers and eliminates players accordingly.
   - The program correctly updates the position of the Quaffle when a player catches or throws it.

3. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The program correctly updates the scores for each team based on the goals scored.

4. **Elimination Handling:**
   - The program correctly prints the elimination of players and ensures that the events are printed in the correct order.
   - The program handles multiple eliminations correctly by sorting them alphabetically.

5. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the final score at the end of the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
