Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect according to the problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Movement Function**: The `func_1` function is defined but not used in the main loop. Instead, the movement logic is directly applied to the player positions without using this function. This inconsistency could lead to errors in movement calculations.

2. **Bludger Handling**: The program does not handle the Bludger correctly. When a player is eliminated due to a Bludger, the program should check if the player is holding the Quaffle and update the Quaffle's position accordingly. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario.

3. **Quaffle Catching and Throwing**: The program does not properly handle the catching and throwing of the Quaffle. Specifically, when a player catches the Quaffle, the program should update the Quaffle's position to the player's current position. The current implementation does not do this.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
```

Expected Output:
```
11 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1
```

Actual Output:
```
10 R0 ELIMINATED
FINAL SCORE: 0 0
```

In this example, the red player moves to the position of the Bludger, gets eliminated, and the Quaffle remains in the same position. The program does not update the Quaffle's position when the player is eliminated, leading to incorrect behavior.

Given these issues, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
