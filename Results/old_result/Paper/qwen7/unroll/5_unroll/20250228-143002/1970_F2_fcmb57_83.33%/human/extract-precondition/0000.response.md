Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N strings in total. The list also includes the number of steps T (0 ≤ T ≤ 10000) and a series of actions for each step, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself.**
