Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `out` is a list containing player identifiers of those players whose positions matched with the Bludger's position. `t` is an integer representing the current time step in the game. `player` is a dictionary where keys are player identifiers and values are their current positions, with any player whose position matched the Bludger's position updated to `[-1, -1]`. `blud` is a list of positions where the Bludger is currently located.
Code of the loop:
for p in sorted(out):
    print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
