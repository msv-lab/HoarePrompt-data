Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function modifies the coordinates of a player or a ball. However, it does not handle the case where the player or ball might move into a position occupied by another player or a Bludger. The function should check if the new position is valid before updating the coordinates.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to eliminate players when they are hit by a Bludger. However, it does not correctly update the state of the game. Specifically:
   - It should check if the player is still within the field boundaries.
   - It should update the player's position and the Bludger's position.
   - It should handle the case where a player is eliminated and the Quaffle is left behind.

3. **General Game Logic**: The provided functions do not cover the full logic required to simulate the game. For example, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, scoring points, and handling multiple balls are not implemented.

### Suggested Approach:
To correctly implement the game logic, you would need to:
- Maintain the state of each player, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
- Handle movement, catching, and throwing actions.
- Check for collisions and eliminations.
- Track the score and print the appropriate events.

Here is a high-level outline of what the solution might look like:

```python
def move_entity(entity, direction, field):
    x, y = entity['position']
    if direction == 'U':
        x -= 1
    elif direction == 'D':
        x += 1
    elif direction == 'L':
        y -= 1
    elif direction == 'R':
        y += 1
    # Ensure the new position is within the field boundaries
    if 0 <= x < len(field) and 0 <= y < len(field[0]):
        entity['position'] = [x, y]

def catch_ball(player, ball):
    player['holding'] = ball

def throw_quaffle(player, field):
    x, y = player['position']
    field[x][y] = '.'
    return [x, y]

def handle_bludger(player, bludger, field):
    x, y = player['position']
    bx, by = bludger['position']
    if (x, y) == (bx, by):
        # Player is eliminated
        print(f"{t} {player['name']} ELIMINATED")
        del player['position']
        del player['holding']

def handle_action(action, field, players, quaffle, bludger, t):
    entity, action_type, *details = action.split()
    if entity in players:
        player = players[entity]
        if action_type == 'U' or action_type == 'D' or action_type == 'L' or action_type == 'R':
            move_entity(player, action_type, field)
        elif action_type == 'C':
            ball = details[0]
            catch_ball(player, ball)
        elif action_type == 'T':
            if 'holding' in player:
                pos = throw_quaffle(player, field)
                quaffle['position'] = pos
                del player['holding']
    elif entity == '.Q':
        quaffle['position'] = [int(details[0]), int(details[1])]
    elif entity == '.B':
        bludger['position'] = [int(details[0]), int(details[1])]
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid entity")

def main():
    N, M = map(int, input().split())
    field = [input().split() for _ in range(N)]
    T = int(input())
    actions = [input() for _ in range(T)]

    players = {}
    quaffle = {'position': None}
    bludger = {'position': None}

    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(M):
            if field[i][j].startswith('R') or field[i][j].startswith('B'):
                players[field[i][j]] = {'position': [i, j], 'holding': None}
            elif field[i][j] == '.Q':
                quaffle['position'] = [i, j]
            elif field[i][j] == '.B':
                bludger['position'] = [i, j]

    for t, action in enumerate(actions):
        handle_action(action, field, players, quaffle, bludger, t)

    # Print events and final score
    # Implement the logic to print events and final score

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is a simplified outline and would need further implementation and testing to ensure correctness.
