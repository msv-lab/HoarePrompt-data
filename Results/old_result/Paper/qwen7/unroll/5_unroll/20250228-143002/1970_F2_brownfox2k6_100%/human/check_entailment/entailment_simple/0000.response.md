Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The program correctly parses the input and initializes the necessary data structures (positions of players, goals, ball, and bludger).
2. **Action Processing Loop**: The loop processes each action correctly. It updates the state of the ball and players based on the actions specified.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly updates the position of the ball or a player based on the direction of movement. It handles all four possible directions ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') appropriately.
4. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the bludger. It sorts the list of eliminated players alphabetically before printing them.
5. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player throws the ball into the opposing team's goal, the appropriate team scores a point, and the ball is reset to the center of the field.
6. **Elimination Logic**: The elimination logic is also implemented correctly. Players who are hit by the bludger are eliminated, and their positions are updated to `[-1, -1]`.
7. **Final Score Output**: The final score is correctly printed at the end of the game.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately and handle all the required functionalities without errors.

Correctness: **True**
