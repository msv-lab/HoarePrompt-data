### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`).
   - It correctly handles the four possible directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated.
   - It iterates over the players dictionary, checks if the player's position matches the Bludger's position, and appends the player's ID to the output list if they are in the same position.
   - It then prints the elimination message for each eliminated player in alphabetical order (using `sorted(out)`).

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program needs to handle the movements, catches, and throws of the players and balls.
   - The logic for handling Bludgers and eliminating players is correctly implemented in `func_2`.
   - However, the program does not seem to handle the main game logic (scoring, catching, throwing, etc.) and the output formatting as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their respective tasks.
- However, the overall program logic is missing. The program should process the game steps, update the positions of players and balls, check for scoring, and handle eliminations based on the Bludger interactions.

Given the incomplete implementation, the provided functions alone do not form a complete solution to the problem.

### Correctness:
**False**
