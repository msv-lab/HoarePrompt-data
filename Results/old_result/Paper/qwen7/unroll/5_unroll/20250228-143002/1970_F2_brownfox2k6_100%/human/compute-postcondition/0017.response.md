Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers representing a position on the field. If the direction `d` is 'U', the row (first element) of `obj` is decremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'D', the row (first element) of `obj` is incremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'L', the column (second element) of `obj` is decremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'R', the column (second element) of `obj` is incremented by 1.
