The function `func_1` accepts a position on a field represented by a list of two integers (`obj`) and a direction of movement (`d`). Based on the direction, it updates the position by moving up ('U'), down ('D'), left ('L'), or right ('R'). After the movement, it returns the updated position as a list of two integers.
