Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging a permutation such that the element `x` is found at the `l` position after performing a binary search. This involves potentially swapping elements up to 2 times.
2. The provided code defines a series of functions to read input and process the test cases. Specifically, `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` handle reading the number of test cases, the values `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`, respectively.
3. The core logic is implemented in the main part of the code, which iterates over each test case, performs the binary search, and determines the necessary swaps.
4. The logic checks if `x` is already at the correct position (`left`). If not, it checks if `x` is missing from the seen list. If `x` is missing, it performs one swap. Otherwise, it performs two swaps to ensure `x` is correctly positioned.
5. The code correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem statement and ensures that the number of swaps does not exceed 2.

Given the analysis, the provided code meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
