The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), pairs of integers `n` and `x`, and a permutation list `p`. It reads the input for these test cases and returns a list of strings, where each string represents the input for one test case. The returned list includes the number of test cases, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `x`, and the permutation list `p` for each test case.
