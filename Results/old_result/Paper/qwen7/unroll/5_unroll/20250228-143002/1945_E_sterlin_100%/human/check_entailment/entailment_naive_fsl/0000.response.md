Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The program defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) but does not contain the actual implementation of the binary search algorithm or the logic to rearrange the permutation. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description and cannot be considered correct.
