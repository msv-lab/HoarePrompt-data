### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required functionality. Specifically, it does not contain the logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search. However, the program does define utility functions that could be used to read input, which is a necessary part of the solution.

Let's break down the problem and the program:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - Read input for multiple test cases.
   - Rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps.
   - Perform a binary search to find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Output the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines five utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`). These functions are designed to read different types of input, which is a crucial part of the solution.
   - There is no actual implementation of the logic to rearrange the permutation or perform the binary search.

Given the problem description, the program should include the following components:
- Reading the input for multiple test cases.
- Rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps.
- Performing the binary search.
- Outputting the number of swaps and the indices of the swaps.

The provided program lacks the actual logic to achieve these steps. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the program does not implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to rearrange the permutation and perform the binary search.
