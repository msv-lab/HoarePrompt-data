Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are just placeholders for reading input and do not contain any logic to solve the problem. The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most two swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` when performing the binary search. The given code does not include any logic to achieve this.

To correctly solve the problem, the program would need to:
1. Read the input.
2. Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
3. Determine the necessary swaps to place `x` at the start of the permutation.
4. Output the swaps.

Here is a possible implementation of the solution:

```python
def find_position(p, x):
    return p.index(x)

def find_swaps(p, x):
    pos_x = find_position(p, x)
    n = len(p)
    
    # Case 1: x is already at the start
    if pos_x == 0:
        return 0, []
    
    # Case 2: x is at the end
    elif pos_x == n - 1:
        return 1, [(pos_x, n-1)]
    
    # Case 3: x is somewhere in the middle
    else:
        # Swap x with the first element
        return 1, [(0, pos_x)]
        # Swap x with the last element
        # return 2, [(0, pos_x), (pos_x, n-1)]

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = func_2()
    p = func_3()
    
    num_swaps, swaps = find_swaps(p, x)
    print(num_swaps)
    for i, j in swaps:
        print(i+1, j+1)  # Adding 1 to convert from 0-based index to 1-based index
```

This code reads the input, finds the position of `x` in the permutation, and determines the necessary swaps to place `x` at the start of the permutation. It then prints the number of swaps and the indices involved in the swaps.
