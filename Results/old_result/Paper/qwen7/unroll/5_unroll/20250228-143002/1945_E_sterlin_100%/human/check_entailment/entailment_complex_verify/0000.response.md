### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) and a number \( x \).
- The goal is to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds \( x \) at position \( l \) when executed.
- The binary search algorithm should find \( p_l = x \).

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \) using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the permutation \( p \) using `func_3()`.

2. **Finding the Target Element:**
   - The code uses a binary search approach to find the target element \( x \) in the permutation.
   - It initializes `left` to 0 and `right` to \( n \).
   - It performs a binary search within the range `[left, right)` until `right - left = 1`.

3. **Swapping Elements:**
   - If the target element \( x \) is not found at position `left`, the code checks if the element at `left` is not already seen.
   - If the element at `left` is not seen, it prints 1 swap and swaps the elements at positions `left` and the index of \( x \) in the permutation.
   - If the element at `left` is seen, it performs 2 swaps:
     - Swaps the elements at positions `left` and the index of the smallest unseen element.
     - Swaps the elements at positions `left` and `left + 1`.

4. **Logic Verification:**
   - The code correctly identifies the position of \( x \) and ensures that the binary search can find it.
   - The logic for performing at most 2 swaps is sound and ensures that the permutation is rearranged appropriately.

#### Detailed Annotations:
- **State before `func_1`:** `t` is the number of test cases.
- **State before `func_2`:** `n` and `x` are the length of the permutation and the target number, respectively.
- **State before `func_3`:** `p` is the permutation of length \( n \).
- **State after `func_2` and `func_3`:** `n`, `x`, and `p` are correctly initialized.
- **State after `func_2` and `func_3`:** `num_indx` maps each element in the permutation to its index.
- **State after `func_2` and `func_3`:** `seen` tracks whether an element has been seen in the binary search.
- **State after `func_2` and `func_3`:** The binary search is performed, and if necessary, swaps are made to ensure the target element is found.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the code correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct as it implements the necessary logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm can find the target element \( x \).
