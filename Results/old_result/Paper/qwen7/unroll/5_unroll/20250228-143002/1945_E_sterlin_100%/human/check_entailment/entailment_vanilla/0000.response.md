### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm should end with `p[l] == x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined correctly in the problem statement. It starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, and it continues until `r - l = 1`. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `m` and updates `l` or `r` based on whether `p[m] <= x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: To ensure `p[l] == x` after the binary search, we need to place `x` at the correct position. We can achieve this by:
   - Finding the index of `x` in the permutation.
   - Placing `x` at position `l` (initially 1) using at most 2 swaps.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not contain the actual logic for solving the problem. Instead, it defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) which are typically used for reading input in Python.
   - There is no function that implements the logic to find the correct swaps to make `p[l] == x`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - Since the provided code does not implement the required logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incomplete and does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
