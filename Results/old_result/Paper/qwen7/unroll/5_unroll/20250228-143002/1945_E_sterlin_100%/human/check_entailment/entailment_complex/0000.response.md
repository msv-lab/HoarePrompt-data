Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation to ensure that `p[l] == x` after performing at most 2 swaps.
2. The annotated functions do not match the problem's requirements:
   - `func_1()`: This function should return the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()`: This function should return the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3()`: This function should return the permutation `p` for each test case.
   - `func_4()`: This function is not used in the provided code.
   - `func_5()`: This function is not used in the provided code.
3. The provided code does not define `func_4()` or `func_5()`, but it directly uses `t`, `n`, `x`, and `p` without calling these functions.
4. The logic in the code correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation and performs the necessary swaps to ensure `p[l] == x` using at most 2 swaps.
5. The code handles all edge cases and ensures that the number of swaps is within the allowed limit.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
