Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1()` is supposed to process each test case and determine if the array can be sorted using the allowed operations.
2. The function `func_1()` reads the input but does not properly handle the operations as described in the problem statement. It only processes numbers greater than 10 and splits them into their constituent digits, but it does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted.
3. The variable `b` is used to store whether each test case can be sorted, but the logic inside `func_1()` is flawed because it does not check if the modified array can actually be sorted.
4. The main loop in the program (`for i in range(m):`) is incorrectly calling `func_1()` without passing any necessary parameters, and it is also incorrectly checking the value of `b[i]` which is not initialized before the loop.
5. The program should sort the final array `c` and check if it is sorted, but it does not do so correctly. Instead, it simply checks if `c` is equal to its sorted version, which is not sufficient to determine if the original array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
