Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.
2. A regular polygon needs at least 3 sides of equal length.
3. The given program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
4. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
5. It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
6. Finally, it calculates the number of regular polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon needs at least 3 sides).

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
- The function `func_1()` is called without parameters, but it expects to read input values which are not provided within the function.
- The variable `t` is set to 1 before reading the actual value from input, which means the loop in the main part of the program will only run once, ignoring all other test cases.

To fix these issues, the program should correctly handle multiple test cases and pass the necessary inputs to `func_1()`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()  # Call the function for each test case

def func_1():
    n = int(input())  # Read the number of sticks
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the stick lengths
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 3  # Calculate the number of polygons
    print(ans)  # Output the result
```

Given the above corrections, the original program does not correctly handle multiple test cases and does not pass the required inputs to `func_1()`. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
