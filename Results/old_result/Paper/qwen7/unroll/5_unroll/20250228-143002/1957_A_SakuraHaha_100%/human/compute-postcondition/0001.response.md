Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of input using `input()`, splits it into a list of strings using `.split()`, and then converts each string in the list to an integer using `map(int, ...)`. This results in the list `a` containing integers. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
