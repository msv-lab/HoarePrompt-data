Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `ans` is the sum of counts of each integer in `a` divided by 3.
- `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the counts of each integer in the list `a` divided by 3.

To break it down further:
- `cnt` contains the count of each integer in `a`.
- For each unique integer in `a`, the count is added to the sum.
- This sum is then divided by 3 to get `ans`.

Since the exact values of `a` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, we know that `ans` is the result of dividing the sum of counts of each integer in `a` by 3.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of counts of each integer in list `a` divided by 3)**
