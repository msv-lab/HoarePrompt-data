Output State: `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, `t` is an input integer, and for each iteration, `value` is set to an integer read from input and then the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` list is printed. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is not affected by the loop.
