Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes a large list `values` of size `inf` (which is set to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\)).
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each number from 1 to `inf`, it calculates the sum of its digits and updates the `values` list such that `values[i]` contains the sum of the numbers from 1 to `i` where each number is replaced by the sum of its digits.

2. **Sum Calculation for Each Number:**
   - For each number `i`, it converts `i` to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - It calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and adds this to `values[i]`.
   - This cumulative sum is stored in `values[i]` such that `values[i]` contains the sum of the transformed numbers from 1 to `i`.

3. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the value `n` and outputs `values[n]`, which is the sum of the numbers from 1 to `n` where each number is replaced by the sum of its digits.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Memory Usage:**
   - The program uses a very large list `values` of size \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\) to store intermediate results. This is unnecessary because we only need to compute the sum for the specific `n` in each test case.
   
2. **Efficiency:**
   - The program recalculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `inf`, which is inefficient and unnecessary. We only need to calculate the sum for the specific `n` in each test case.

3. **Time Limit:**
   - Given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case, the current approach is not efficient enough for large values of `n` (up to \(2 \times 10^5\)).

### Correct Solution:

A more efficient approach would be to directly calculate the sum of the numbers from 1 to `n` where each number is replaced by the sum of its digits without storing all intermediate results.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            sum_value_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            total_sum += sum_value_digits
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to its inefficiency and excessive memory usage. The corrected program directly computes the required sum for each test case without storing intermediate results.

**Correctness: False**
