The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`. The function initializes a list `values` to store these cumulative sums up to 200,000. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the required cumulative sums for each test case.
