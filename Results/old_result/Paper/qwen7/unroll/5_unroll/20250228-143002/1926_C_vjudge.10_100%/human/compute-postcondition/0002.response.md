Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. This list is created based on the value of `inf`, which is 200001. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.
