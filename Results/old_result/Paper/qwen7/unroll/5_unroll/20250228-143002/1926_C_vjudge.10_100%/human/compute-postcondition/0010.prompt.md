You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, `t` is an input integer, and for each iteration, `value` is set to an integer read from input and then the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` list is printed. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers: `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function does not return any value directly but implies processing or validating these integers within its body.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
