Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Specifically, the program checks if any element in the array is negative before attempting to perform the operations, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of making all elements zero.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
- Expected Output:
```
YES
```
- Program Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly returns "NO" because it checks if any element is negative before performing the operations, but it does not correctly simulate the operations to ensure that all elements can eventually be reduced to zero. The correct approach would involve simulating the operations and checking if it's possible to reduce all elements to zero, rather than just checking for negative elements.
