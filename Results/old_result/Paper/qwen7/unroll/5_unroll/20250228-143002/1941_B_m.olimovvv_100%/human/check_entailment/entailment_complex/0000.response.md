Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly follows the problem statement.
2. The program iterates through each test case, reading the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
3. For each test case, it performs the specified operations in a loop from index 0 to `n-3` (inclusive).
4. In each iteration, it checks if `b[i]` is less than 0. If so, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
5. If no negative value is encountered, it continues to perform the required operations on `b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`.
6. After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
7. The logic ensures that if any element becomes negative during the operations, the program correctly identifies that it's impossible to make all elements zero.
8. The program handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem accurately.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
