You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then checks if all elements in the list \( a \) are non-negative and if certain arithmetic operations performed on consecutive elements result in specific conditions being met. If these conditions are satisfied for all test cases, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `b`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since we need to check up to `a-2`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it performs the following operations:
     - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (this line is redundant and effectively sets `b[i]` to 0)

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Operation Validity:**
   - The operation defined in the problem is valid and can reduce the elements of the array.
   - The program correctly implements this operation.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b[i]` becomes negative, which would make further operations invalid.
   - The final check ensures that no residual non-zero elements remain after processing.

3. **Redundant Code:**
   - The line `b[i] -= b[i]` is redundant since it sets `b[i]` to 0, which is already done implicitly by the previous operations.

4. **Logic Flow:**
   - The logic flow is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. It handles edge cases appropriately and follows the problem constraints.
