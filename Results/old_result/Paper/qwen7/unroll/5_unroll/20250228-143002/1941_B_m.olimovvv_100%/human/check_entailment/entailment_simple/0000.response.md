### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if we can make all elements of the array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It then iterates through the array from index 0 to \(n-3\) (i.e., up to the second last element).
   - In each iteration, it checks if the current element \(b[i]\) is less than 0. If so, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop since it's impossible to have a negative value in the array after applying the operation.
   - If no negative value is encountered, it updates the subsequent elements based on the operation.
   - Finally, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the array cannot be made zero due to encountering a negative value during the operation.
   - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary for the array to be completely zeroed out.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement and constraints.
   - The approach correctly identifies whether the array can be made zero or not based on the given operations.
   - There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
