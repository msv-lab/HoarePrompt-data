The function processes up to 50,000 test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \) using a specific algorithm. The final state of the program includes printing these calculated values for each test case.
