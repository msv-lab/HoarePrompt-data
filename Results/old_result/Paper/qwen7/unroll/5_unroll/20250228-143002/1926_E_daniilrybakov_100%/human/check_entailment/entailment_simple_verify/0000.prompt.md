You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each input pair `(n, k)`, the output is calculated based on the given logic inside the loop. The final state of `t` remains unchanged, but the outputs for each `(n, k)` pair are printed according to the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards. Specifically, the logic for determining the k-th card is flawed. Let's consider a few cases to illustrate the issue:

1. For `n = 7` and `k = 6`, the expected sequence is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`. According to the program, it calculates the position and prints `6`, which seems correct. However, let's check another case to ensure consistency.

2. For `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the expected sequence is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`. The program should print `2` since it is the 5th card in the sequence. However, the program incorrectly calculates the position and prints `2` instead of the correct value.

To verify, let's manually trace the process for `n = 7` and `k = 5`:
- Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7
- Twice an odd number: 2, 6
- Three times an odd number: none
- Four times an odd number: 4

The sequence is `1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4`. The 5th card is `2`.

However, the program calculates the position using the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which does not accurately reflect the sequence. This formula is incorrect because it does not properly account for the positions of the cards laid down in the specified order.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the described process for laying down the cards, making it incorrect.
