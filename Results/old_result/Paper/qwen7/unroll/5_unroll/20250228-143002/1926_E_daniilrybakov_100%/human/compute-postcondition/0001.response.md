State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` from the expression `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires a non-negative integer as its argument.
3. Additionally, the problem specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4`, so `t` must also be within this range.
4. No other variables or states need to be adjusted since the loop head only involves `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts must ensure that `t` meets the specified conditions.
