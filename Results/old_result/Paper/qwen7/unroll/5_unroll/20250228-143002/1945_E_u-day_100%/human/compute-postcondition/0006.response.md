Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n`. The variable `pos` retains its initial state, which is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`, otherwise `-1`. The value of `n` is assumed to be a positive integer representing the length of the array `arr`.
