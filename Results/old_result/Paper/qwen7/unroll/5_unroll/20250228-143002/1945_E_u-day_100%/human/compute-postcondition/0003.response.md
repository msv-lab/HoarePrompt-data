Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n):`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - The variable `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` generates a sequence from 0 to `n-1`, and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the given initial states**:
   - `pos` is -1.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
   - `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. This is already stated as `n` is a positive integer, so no additional adjustment is needed for `n`.

5. **Final state after adjustment**:
   - `pos` remains -1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0 (already satisfied).
   - No adjustments needed for `k` and `arr` since they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the final state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`pos` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0**
