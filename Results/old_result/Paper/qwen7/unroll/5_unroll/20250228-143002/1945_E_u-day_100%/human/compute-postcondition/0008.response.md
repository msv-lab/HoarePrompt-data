Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n`.
   - `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is -1.
   - `st` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Currently, `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`.
   - To satisfy the condition `low + 1 < high`, `high` must be greater than `low + 1`, which means `high` must be greater than 1.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `high`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1, `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if `k` is present in `arr`, otherwise `pos` is -1; `st` is an empty set**
