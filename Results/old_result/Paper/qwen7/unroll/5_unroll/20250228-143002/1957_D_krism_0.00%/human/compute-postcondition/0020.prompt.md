Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans` is 0, `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result; `pre` remains unchanged as a list of lists containing [32, 0] repeated 32 times; `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, where each sublist has been updated such that the first element (number of zeros) and the second element (number of ones) reflect the count of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, across all `cur` values for each bit position from 0 to 31 during the loop executions.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    y = arr[i - 1]
    k = y.bit_length() - 1
    ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
    c = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if c >> j & 1:
            pre[j][1] += 1
            suf[j][1] -= 1
        else:
            pre[j][0] += 1
            suf[j][0] -= 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
