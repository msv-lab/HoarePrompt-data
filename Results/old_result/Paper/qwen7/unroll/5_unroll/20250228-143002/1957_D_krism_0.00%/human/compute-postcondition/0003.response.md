Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing only the integer 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `prefix` as a list containing a single element, which is `0`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `prefix` as specified.
