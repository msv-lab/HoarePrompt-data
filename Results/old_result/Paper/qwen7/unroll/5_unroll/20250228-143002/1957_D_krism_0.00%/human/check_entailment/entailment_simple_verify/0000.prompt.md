You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly calculate the number of tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix XORs**: The program calculates the prefix XORs correctly but does not use them effectively to count the valid tuples. The prefix XORs are stored in the `prefix` array, but the logic to count the tuples is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Tuples**: The program uses two arrays `pre` and `suf` to store counts of bits set to 1 and 0. However, the logic to update these arrays and count the valid tuples is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the XOR operations and the conditions specified in the problem statement.

3. **Missing Key Logic**: The program lacks the key logic to iterate through all possible values of `y` and `z` for each `x` and check the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`. Instead, it attempts to count the tuples using bit manipulation, which is not correctly implemented.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```

6 2 4
1

5
7 3 7 2 1

0
16
