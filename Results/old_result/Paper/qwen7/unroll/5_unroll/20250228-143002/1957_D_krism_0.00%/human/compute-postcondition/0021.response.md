Output State: `ans` is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31, calculated based on the cumulative XOR values of the array elements. `prefix` is a list where each element represents the cumulative XOR up to that index in the array. `pre` remains unchanged as a list of lists containing [32, 0] repeated 32 times. `suf` is a list where each sublist contains the updated counts of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31 across all `cur` values for each bit position after the loop executions.
