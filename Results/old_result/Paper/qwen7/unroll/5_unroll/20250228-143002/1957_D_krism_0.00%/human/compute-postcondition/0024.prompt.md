You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    print('-----------------')
    #This is printed: -----------------
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: arr, [0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an]
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result; `pre` is a list of lists containing [32, 0] repeated 32 times; `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, each with the values [0, 0].
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result; `pre` remains unchanged as a list of lists containing [32, 0] repeated 32 times; `suf` is a list containing 32 sublists, where each sublist has been updated such that the first element (number of zeros) and the second element (number of ones) reflect the count of bits set to 0 and 1, respectively, across all `cur` values for each bit position from 0 to 31 during the loop executions.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: [[32, 0], [32, 0], [32, 0], ..., [32, 0]] (32 times)
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [[32, 0]] * 32
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31, calculated based on the cumulative XOR values of the array elements. `prefix` is a list where each element represents the cumulative XOR up to that index in the array. `pre` remains unchanged as a list of lists containing [32, 0] repeated 32 times. `suf` is a list where each sublist contains the updated counts of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31 across all `cur` values for each bit position after the loop executions.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31, calculated based on the cumulative XOR values of the array elements)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list for each test case, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns a result based on the provided integers.
