Reasoning:
1. The provided program is designed to solve the problem correctly according to the problem statement.
2. The program iterates through each test case, calculating the cumulative XOR values for different subarrays.
3. It uses prefix and suffix arrays to count the number of zeros and ones for each bit position up to 31.
4. The logic to calculate the number of valid tuples \((x, y, z)\) is implemented correctly by iterating through the array and updating the counts in the prefix and suffix arrays.
5. The final answer is computed by summing the products of the counts of zeros and ones for each bit position, which aligns with the problem requirements.
6. However, the program does not actually return the result; instead, it prints the result. Since the problem asks for the output to be printed, this is acceptable.

Given the above points, the program logic is correct, even though it does not explicitly return the result. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
