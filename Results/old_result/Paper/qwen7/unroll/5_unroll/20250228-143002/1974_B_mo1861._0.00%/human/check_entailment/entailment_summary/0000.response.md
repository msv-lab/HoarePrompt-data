Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` aims to decode the encoded string `b` by mapping each unique character in `b` to a character in reverse alphabetical order.
2. The mapping is correctly established by sorting the unique characters of `b` and assigning them from 'z' to 'a' based on their position in the sorted list.
3. The function iterates through each character in `b`, uses the `char_map` to find the corresponding decoded character, and constructs the decoded string `s`.
4. Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the logic implemented in `func_1` aligns with the requirements for decoding the string.

Based on the above reasoning, the function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
