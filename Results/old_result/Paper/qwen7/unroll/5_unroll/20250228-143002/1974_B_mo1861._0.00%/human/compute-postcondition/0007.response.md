Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for c in b:`. The objects involved here are `c` and `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted set.
   - `s` is an empty string.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop iterates over each character `c` in the set `b`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `b` must contain at least one character.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `c` is the variable that will take on each value from `b` during the loop iterations, `b` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `s` and `char_map` does not affect whether the loop can start, but they are part of the overall program state.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the state of `b`.

**State: **`b` must contain at least one character**
