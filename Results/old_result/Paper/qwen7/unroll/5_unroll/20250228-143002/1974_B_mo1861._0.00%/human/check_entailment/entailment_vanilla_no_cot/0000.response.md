Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string `b` by following these steps:

1. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string itself.
3. It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in `b` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed alphabet order.
4. Finally, it constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly decodes the string according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
