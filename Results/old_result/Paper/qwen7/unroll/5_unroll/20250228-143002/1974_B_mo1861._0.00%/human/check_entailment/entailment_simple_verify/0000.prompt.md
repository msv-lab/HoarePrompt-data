You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the issue lies in the `char_map` construction. The program incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character. The mapping should be based on the position of each character in the sorted set, but the current implementation uses the length of the encoded string `b` to determine the symmetric position, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The sorted unique characters in `b` are `cdefors`, and their symmetric positions should be:

- 'c' -> 's'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'e' -> 'e'
- 'f' -> 'd'
- 'o' -> 'o'
- 'r' -> 'c'

However, the current implementation incorrectly maps these characters. For instance, the character 'c' in the sorted set is mapped to the character at position `len(b) - 1 - 0` (which is 9), resulting in 's'. This is incorrect because 'c' should map to 's', not 's'.

To fix this, the mapping should be constructed based on the index of each character in the sorted set, not the length of the encoded string. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    sorted_unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for i, c in enumerate(sorted_unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This corrected function will properly decode the encoded string according to the problem description.
