Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is used to iterate over the elements of the set `b`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `c`**: Since `c` is being used to iterate over the elements of `b`, it should start with the first element of `b` before the loop starts.

3. **Determine the initial state of `b`**: The set `b` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. If `b` is empty, the loop will not run.

4. **Determine the state of `char_map` and `s`**: These variables are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, they are mentioned in the problem statement, so we include them in the final state description.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `b` must have at least one element.
- `c` must be the first element of `b`.

So, the final state is:

**State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted set, `s` is an empty string, `b` must have at least one element, and `c` is the first element of `b`**.
