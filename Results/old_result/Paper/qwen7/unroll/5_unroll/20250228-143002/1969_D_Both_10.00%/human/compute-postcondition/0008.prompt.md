You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_ar is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i). sec_arr is a list of integers. The length of main_ar is n, and the length of sec_arr is also n.
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
        
    #State: Output State: `sub_summ` is the sum of the first element of each sublist in `sec_arr`.
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
        
    #State: `sub_summ` is the sum of the first and second elements of each sublist in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0.
    return sub_summ
    #The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first and second elements of each sublist in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers, both of the same length. It returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `sub_summ`, which is the sum of the first and second elements of each sublist in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
