State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `sec_arr` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `val_a`, which is used to iterate over the elements of `sec_arr`.
2. For the loop to execute, `sec_arr` must contain at least one element because the `for` loop iterates over each element in the list.
3. The variable `sub_summ` is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition; its initial value is given as 0.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `sec_arr` must be a non-empty list.

Hence, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to include the condition that `sec_arr` must have at least one element.
