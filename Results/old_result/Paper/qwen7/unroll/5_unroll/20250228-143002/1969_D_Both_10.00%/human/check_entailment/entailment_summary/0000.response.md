Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, making optimal choices to maximize and minimize Alice's profit, respectively. Alice chooses items to buy, and Bob either takes some items for free or pays for them. The goal is to calculate Alice's optimal profit under these conditions.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads the number of test cases.
   - **func_2()**: Reads space-separated integers from the input and returns them as a list of integers.
   - **func_3()**: Calculates a sum based on the given logic, but its role in the overall solution seems to be misunderstood. It is used to calculate a temporary sum which is later compared to find the maximum profit.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic sorts the items based on Bob's prices (`b_i`).
   - It uses a min-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the smallest Bob's prices.
   - The algorithm iteratively processes items, updating the sum of Alice's profit considering the optimal strategy for both players.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The sorting ensures that Bob's free items are chosen from the most expensive ones first.
   - The min-heap helps in efficiently managing the free items Bob might take.
   - The logic correctly handles the transition from taking no items for free to taking up to `k` items for free.

5. **Verification**:
   - The code correctly implements the strategy for both players.
   - It handles edge cases such as when `k` is zero or when there are fewer than `k` items.
   - The logic for updating the sum of Alice's profit is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under the given constraints and rules.

Correctness: **True**
