Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to `k`.
   - All integers from 1 to `n` except `k` can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution constructs a list `nums` of size 25.
   - It uses powers of 2 to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can be formed as a subsequence sum.
   - It specifically handles the value `k` by removing one of the powers of 2 and adjusting the list to ensure no subsequence sums to `k`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The construction ensures that all numbers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a sum of the remaining elements.
   - By removing one power of 2 (`1 << idx`), it ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The list `nums` is constructed to include all powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\).
   - It includes `k - nums[idx]` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed as a subsequence sum.
   - It includes `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.
   - The removal of `1 << idx` ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a subsequence sum.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
