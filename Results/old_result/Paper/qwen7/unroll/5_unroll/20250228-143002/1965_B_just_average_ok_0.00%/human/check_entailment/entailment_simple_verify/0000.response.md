### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
     - No subsequence of `a` has a sum equal to `k`.
     - For every integer `v` from 1 to `n` (where `v \neq k`), there exists a subsequence of `a` whose sum is `v`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `nums` with the first 24 powers of 2.
   - It finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and calculates `idx` as the index of this power.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to `nums`.
   - It removes `1 << idx` from `nums`.
   - Finally, it prints the length of `nums` and the elements of `nums`.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The sequence `nums` is constructed to include all powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to `k`, plus some additional numbers.
   - The sequence ensures that all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by subsequences.
   - The sequence avoids including `k` directly and ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully constructing the sequence.

4. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - The annotated code shows that `nums` is constructed as `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216, k - 2^idx, k + 1, k + 2^idx + 1]`.
   - This construction ensures that:
     - All powers of 2 up to `2^idx` are included.
     - `k - 2^idx` is included to ensure that all sums up to `k - 1` can be formed.
     - `k + 1` and `k + 2^idx + 1` are included to ensure that all sums from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
     - `1 << idx` is removed to avoid forming a subsequence that sums to `k`.

Given these observations and the annotations, the program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. The sequence avoids forming a subsequence that sums to `k` and ensures that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
