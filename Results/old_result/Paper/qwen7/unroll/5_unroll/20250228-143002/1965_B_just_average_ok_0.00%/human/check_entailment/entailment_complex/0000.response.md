Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence \(a\) of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \(k\).
   - All integers from 1 to \(n\) except \(k\) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution generates a list `nums` of 25 elements for each test case.
   - It includes powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It also includes specific values derived from \(k\) and the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\).

3. **Verification of Conditions**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to \(k\)**: The constructed list `nums` does not include \(k\) directly, and the specific values added (like \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\)) ensure that \(k\) cannot be formed as a subsequence sum.
   - **All Integers from 1 to \(n\) Except \(k\)**: By including powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (since the maximum length is 25 and the highest power of 2 included is \(2^{23}\)), and using the specific values, all integers from 1 to \(n\) (except \(k\)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the upper limit of \(n\) and \(k\) correctly within the constraints.
   - The construction ensures that the sequence length is always 25, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution meets both conditions specified in the problem statement and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
