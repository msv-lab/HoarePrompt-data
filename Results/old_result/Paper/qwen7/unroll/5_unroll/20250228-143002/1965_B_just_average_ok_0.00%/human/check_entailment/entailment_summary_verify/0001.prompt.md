You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(24)]
        idx = 0
        while k >= 1 << idx:
            idx += 1
        idx -= 1
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it constructs a list `nums` containing specific values derived from \( k \) and prints the length of `nums` followed by its elements. The list `nums` always contains 25 elements and includes powers of 2 up to the highest power less than or equal to \( k \), along with \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \), \( k + 1 \), and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \), where \( \text{idx} \) is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (since \(2^{24} > 10^9\)).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - Finally, it removes the largest power of 2 from the list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified list `nums`.
   - It then prints the elements of the list `nums`.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints and Requirements:

1. **Sequence Size:**
   - The sequence `nums` is constructed to have at most 25 elements, which satisfies the constraint \(1 \le m \le 25\).

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and ensuring that `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are included, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because any subsequence that includes `k - nums[idx]` will include a power of 2 that makes the sum exactly `k`.

3. **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values:**
   - The remaining elements in `nums` cover a wide range of values, ensuring that every value from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed as a subsequence sum. This is due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and the additional elements added to ensure coverage.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases well, such as when `k` itself is a power of 2, by ensuring that the necessary adjustments are made to avoid including `k` in any subsequence sum.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly generates a sequence that meets all the specified conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
