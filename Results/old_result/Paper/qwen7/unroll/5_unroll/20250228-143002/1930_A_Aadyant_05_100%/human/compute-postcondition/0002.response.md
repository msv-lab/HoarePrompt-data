Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves two variables: `num` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `final` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `num` in the range from `0` to `int(n) - 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `num = 0`, the initial value of `num` should be set to `0`.
   - The variable `n` must be within its valid range, i.e., \(1 \leq n \leq 50\).

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The state of `t` and `final` does not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:
State: **`num` is 0, `n` must be between 1 and 50 inclusive**
