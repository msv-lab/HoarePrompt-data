You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = input()
    final = []
    for num in range(int(n)):
        s = 0
        list2 = []
        a = input()
        list1 = []
        b = input()
        list1 = b.split()
        for str in list1:
            list2.append(int(str))
        list2.sort()
        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):
            s = s + int(list2[i])
        final.append(s)
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():

        s = 0

        list1 = []
        
        b = input()

        for i in range(0, len(list2), 2):

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `final` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the sum of every first number in pairs from the sorted lists of integers provided as inputs.
    for fin in final:
        print(fin)
        
    #State: Output State: `final` is a list containing `n` elements, each element being the sum of every first number in pairs from the sorted lists of integers provided as inputs, and the loop prints each element of the `final` list on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) within the range of 1 to 10^7. For each test case, it sorts the integers, sums the first number in each pair, and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum on a new line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program reads inputs in a way that does not match the problem description. The problem description states that each test case starts with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by the number of integers `n` and then `2n` integers. However, the program reads `n` as a string and then reads inputs in a loop without properly handling the structure of the input.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

For the input:
```
3
1
1 2
2
1 1 2 1
3
1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
2
3
```

However, the program's current implementation will fail because it reads `n` as a string and then processes the input in a loop without properly distinguishing between the number of test cases and the actual input for each test case. This leads to incorrect processing of the input data.

To fix this, the program should read the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, read `n` and the `2n` integers correctly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = list(map(int, data[index:index + 2 * n]))
        index += 2 * n
        
        numbers.sort()
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version properly handles the input structure and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
