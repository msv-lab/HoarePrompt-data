Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50**.

Explanation: The code `n = input()` reads an input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The updated state includes the new value of `n` which is an integer between 1 and 50.
