State: **`loop` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, `iterable` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable in the given for loop is `iterable`.
2. The loop starts from `range(loop)`, meaning `iterable` will iterate from 0 to `loop-1`.
3. For the loop to execute, `iterable` must start at 0 and increment until it reaches `loop`.

Therefore, the initial state of `iterable` must be 0, and `loop` should remain as given since it defines the upper limit of the loop iterations.
