The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a set of constraints. For each test case, it identifies the smallest integer greater than any number in the 'big' list and less than any number in the 'less' list, while excluding numbers in the 'no' list. If such an integer exists, it is stored in the variable `num`; otherwise, `num` remains 0. Finally, it prints the value of `num` for each test case.
