You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, each test case contains n constraints where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        for i in range(max(big), min(less)):
            if i not in no:
                num = i
                break
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `num` after all iterations of the loop, which is the smallest integer greater than any element in `big` and less than any element in `less`, excluding any elements in `no`. If no such integer exists, `num` remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), where each test case includes n constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) represented by pairs (a, x) with a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
