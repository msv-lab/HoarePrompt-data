Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), where each test case includes n constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) represented by pairs (a, x) with a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
