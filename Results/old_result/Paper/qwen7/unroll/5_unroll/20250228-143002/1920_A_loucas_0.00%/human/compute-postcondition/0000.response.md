Output State: **`loop` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive. Each test case contains `n` constraints where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**

Explanation: The code `loop = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `loop`. This integer is specified to be between 1 and 500, inclusive. The precondition regarding the number of constraints (`n`) and their representation remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `loop` and retains the original conditions for `n` and the constraints.
