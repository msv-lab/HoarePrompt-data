Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to find a single value `num` between the maximum of `big` and the minimum of `less` that is not in `no`. However, this logic only finds the first such value, but it should count all such values. The program should iterate through all values between `max(big)` and `min(less)` and check if they are not in `no`.

2. **Counting Values**: The program should count how many values between `max(big)` and `min(less)` are not in `no`, rather than just finding the first one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for _ in range(loop):
        less = []
        big = []
        no = set()
        num_count = 0
        innerLoop = int(input())
        for _ in range(innerLoop):
            (x, a) = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.add(a)
        
        # Ensure big and less are sorted
        big.sort()
        less.sort()
        
        max_big = max(big)
        min_less = min(less)
        
        # Count the number of valid k values
        for k in range(max_big + 1, min_less):
            if k not in no:
                num_count += 1
        
        print(num_count)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all valid `k` values between `max(big)` and `min(less)` are counted, and it handles the constraints correctly.
