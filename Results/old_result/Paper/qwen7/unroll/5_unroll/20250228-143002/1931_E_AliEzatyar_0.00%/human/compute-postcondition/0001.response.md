State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is len(num) - 1, `num` is a list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):`. This means that `i` will take values from `len(num) - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.
2. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be within the valid range specified by `range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1)`.
3. The initial value of `i` is set to `len(num) - 1`, which is the highest possible value for `i`.
4. The variable `counter` is not directly involved in the loop's condition or its execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.
5. The variable `num` is used in the range function to determine the upper limit of the loop, so it must be a list to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to `len(num) - 1`, and `num` being a list.
