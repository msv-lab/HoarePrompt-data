Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case.
2. The provided code snippet does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically:
   - It initializes `soma` to 0 and reads `N`, which is the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `N` times, reading `n` for each iteration and calling `func_1(i)` for each `i` in the range of `n`.
   - This means it's summing the digits of every integer from 1 to \(n\) for each test case, rather than summing the digits of the integers from 1 to \(n\) once for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given integer \(n\).

Given the above points, the code does not correctly solve the problem as described. It should iterate over each integer from 1 to \(n\) for each test case and calculate the sum of their digits, but instead, it incorrectly iterates over a range of \(n\) for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
