Reasoning:
- The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
- The program initializes `soma` to 0 and then iterates over `N` (which should be the number of test cases), but it incorrectly uses `N` as the upper limit for the inner loop. This means it will repeatedly process the same input multiple times.
- The function `func_1(n)` is defined correctly to compute the sum of the digits of a number.
- However, the main loop should iterate over the test cases, and for each test case, it should calculate the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to `n`.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it processes each test case multiple times instead of processing each number from 1 to `n` for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
