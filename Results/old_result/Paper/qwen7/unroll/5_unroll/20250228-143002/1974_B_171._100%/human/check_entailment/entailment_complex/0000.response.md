Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode a string `encoded` that was previously encoded according to the specified algorithm.
3. The function first creates a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically.
4. It then creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted list of unique characters is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the list.
5. Finally, it uses this dictionary to decode the `encoded` string by replacing each character with its mapped value.
6. The logic in the function is sound and should produce the correct decoded string for any valid input.

Given the above points, the provided implementation appears to correctly implement the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
