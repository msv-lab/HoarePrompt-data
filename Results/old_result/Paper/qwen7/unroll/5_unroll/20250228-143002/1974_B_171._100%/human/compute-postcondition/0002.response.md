Output State: **`len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically, and `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the `unique_chars` list and assigns it to `len_unique`. The value of `unique_chars` and the fact that `char_map` is an empty dictionary remain unchanged.
