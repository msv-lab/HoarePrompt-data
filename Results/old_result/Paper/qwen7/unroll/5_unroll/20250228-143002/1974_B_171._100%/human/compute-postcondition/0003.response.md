Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `len_unique`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`.
   - `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len_unique`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should start at 0 because the loop starts with the first iteration.
   - `len_unique` should be set to the actual length of `unique_chars`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len_unique`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`**
