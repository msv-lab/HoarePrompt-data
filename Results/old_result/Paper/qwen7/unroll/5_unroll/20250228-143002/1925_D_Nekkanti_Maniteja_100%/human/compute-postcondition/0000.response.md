Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`:**
   - The initial value of `i` is determined by `int(input())`.
   - Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \times 10^4\), the input will provide the value of `i` for the loop.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range specified by `range(t)`, which means `0 <= i < t`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `i`, which is derived from the input `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0 (the loop will continue as long as `i < t`)**
