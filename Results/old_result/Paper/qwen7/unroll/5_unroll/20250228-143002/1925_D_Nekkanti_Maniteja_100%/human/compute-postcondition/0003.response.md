Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It returns information based on the given constraints and inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases where each test case includes several integers (t, n, m, k) and additional details (a_i, b_i, f_i) for m pairs of friends. The function processes these inputs according to specified constraints and returns relevant information based on the data provided.
