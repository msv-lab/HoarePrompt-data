Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now we know that `t` is specifically the integer input provided by the user. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
