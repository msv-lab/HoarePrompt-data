### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index \(i\) must be less than the destination container index \(j\).

2. **Key Insight**: Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by \(n\), the average amount of water per container is \(\frac{\text{sum of } a_i}{n}\). If we can distribute the water such that each container ends up with this average amount, the answer is "YES". Otherwise, it is "NO".

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers \(n\) and the amounts of water in each container.
   - It calculates `curr` as the difference between the last element (`last`) and each element in the list `nums`.
   - It checks if `curr` is zero and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

4. **Flaw in the Given Solution**:
   - The logic in the given solution is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `curr` does not correctly reflect the total amount of water that needs to be redistributed to achieve equal distribution.
   - The variable `curr` should represent the total amount of water that needs to be moved to make all containers have the same amount of water. However, the current implementation does not correctly calculate this value.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the average amount of water per container, which is \(\frac{\text{sum of } a_i}{n}\).
   - Check if the sum of the differences between each container's water and the average is zero. If it is, it means the water can be evenly distributed.

6. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The given code calculates `curr` as the difference between the last element and each element in the list. This does not reflect the total amount of water that needs to be redistributed.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the sum of all elements, dividing by \(n\) to get the target amount, and then checking if the sum of differences between each element and the target is zero.

7. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers in the list. If this cumulative sum is zero, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed. The function summary also does not accurately describe the intended behavior of the function.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
