Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, each iteration of the loop processes input values for `m` and `arr`, and after all iterations, the final value of `ans` is printed as either 'NO' or 'YES'. The final state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged from their initial values, while `m` and `arr` are updated based on the input during each iteration.
