You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 50 \)) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (each between 0 and 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent elements at most once. If such a swap is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `m` of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`.

2. **Loop Through Array Elements:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array from the last element to the second element.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`).

3. **Check and Modify Array:**
   - If the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, it converts the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`) into a list of its digits.
   - It appends the current element (`arr[i]`) to this list of digits.
   - It checks if this combined list of digits is sorted.
     - If not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` with the first digit of the sorted list.

4. **Output Result:**
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Backward Iteration Logic:**
   - The program correctly identifies when a smaller element precedes a larger one.
   - However, the logic for modifying the array is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks if the combined list of digits is sorted but does not actually perform the necessary operations to ensure the array can be sorted.

2. **Example Analysis:**
   - **Example 1:** `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
     - The program correctly identifies that `45` should be split into `[4, 5]` and placed before `67`.
     - This results in the array `[12, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is sorted.
   - **Example 2:** `[12, 28, 5]`
     - The program incorrectly assumes that splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and placing it before `5` would result in a sorted array.
     - This results in the array `[12, 2, 8, 5]`, which is not sorted.
   - **Example 3:** `[0, 0]`
     - The array is already sorted, so the program correctly outputs "YES".

3. **General Case:**
   - The program does not correctly handle all cases where the array can be sorted through the allowed operations.
   - It fails to properly simulate the process of splitting and reinserting digits to achieve a sorted array.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
