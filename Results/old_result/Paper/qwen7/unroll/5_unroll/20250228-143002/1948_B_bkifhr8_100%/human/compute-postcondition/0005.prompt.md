You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, each iteration of the loop processes input values for `m` and `arr`, and after all iterations, the final value of `ans` is printed as either 'NO' or 'YES'. The final state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged from their initial values, while `m` and `arr` are updated based on the input during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, then reads `n` integers each between 0 and 99. The function returns a value based on the processed input.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
