Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for char in password:`. The objects involved here are `char`, `password`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
   - `digits` and `letters` are both empty lists.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in the `password` string. For the loop to execute, `password` must contain at least one character (since `1 <= n <= 20`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each character in `password`, `password` must contain at least one character. Therefore, `password` should be non-empty.
   - The loop variable `char` will take on each character in `password` during each iteration, but its initial value is not specified in the loop head. We don't need to adjust the state of `char` specifically because it will be assigned a value from `password` during each iteration.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`password` is a non-empty string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where `1 <= n <= 20`, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.**
