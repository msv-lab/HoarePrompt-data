You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    return 'YES'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where 1 <= n <= 20, and each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

        #The program returns 'NO'

    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a password string and checks if it meets specific criteria. It first separates the password into digits and letters, then checks if the digits and letters are in sorted order. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'. If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits the input into a list called `data`.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it checks if the password meets the conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order.
   - It also ensures that no digit comes after a letter.

3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also correctly identifies if any digit comes after a letter.

### Detailed Checks

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The code correctly separates digits and letters into two lists (`digits` and `letters`).

2. **Checking Non-Decreasing Order**:
   - The code checks if both `digits` and `letters` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is done using `sorted(digits)` and `sorted(letters)`.

3. **No Digit After Letter**:
   - The code maintains a `last_digit_index` to track the last seen digit index.
   - If a letter is encountered after a digit, it immediately returns "NO".

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty Passwords**:
   - The provided code handles empty passwords correctly since the sorting check will pass for an empty list.

2. **Passwords with Only Digits or Only Letters**:
   - The code correctly handles such cases as well.

### Conclusion

The provided code correctly implements the logic to verify if a password is strong according to the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
