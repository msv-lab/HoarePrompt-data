Output State: The output consists of multiple lines. For each test case, if \( k \geq 2 \):
- If \( n = k \), the line contains \( k \) occurrences of \( k \).
- Otherwise, the line contains `-1`.
If \( k < 2 \), the line contains \( n \) occurrences of integers starting from 1 up to \( n \).

For example, given test cases with inputs like:
- "3 2" -> Outputs: `2 2 2`
- "4 1" -> Outputs: `1 2 3 4`
- "5 3" -> Outputs: `3 3 3`
