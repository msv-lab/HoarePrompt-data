Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case where \( n = k \geq 2 \):
   - It prints \( k \) occurrences of \( k \).
   - This ensures that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted, as required.
   
2. The program correctly handles the case where \( k < 2 \):
   - It prints numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - Since \( k < 2 \), only one cyclic shift will be sorted (the original array itself), which matches the requirement.
   
3. The program incorrectly handles the case where \( n \neq k \) and \( k \geq 2 \):
   - It prints `-1`.
   - However, this is not always the correct answer. For example, consider \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 2 \). A valid array could be `[1, 2, 3]` where the cyclic shifts `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 1]` are sorted. The program would incorrectly print `-1` in this case.
   
Given these points, the program does not handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
