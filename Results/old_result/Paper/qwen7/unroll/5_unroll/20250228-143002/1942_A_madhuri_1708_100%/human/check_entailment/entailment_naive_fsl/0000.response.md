Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate arrays that meet the criteria for certain values of `n` and `k`.

Consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 2`. According to the problem description, we need to find an array such that exactly 2 out of the 3 cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks for `k >= 2` and handles it by printing `-1` if `n != k`. This means the program will incorrectly output `-1` for this case, as there exists a valid array `[69420, 69, 420]` that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, and the output is incorrect for at least one valid input.
