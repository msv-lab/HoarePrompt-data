Output State: The output consists of lines where each line corresponds to a test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, and `n` is equal to `k`, it prints a line with `k` occurrences of `k`. Otherwise, if `k` is less than 2, it prints a line with numbers from 1 to `n`. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k` is at least 2, it prints `-1`. The total number of lines does not exceed 1000, corresponding to the sum of `n` over all test cases.
