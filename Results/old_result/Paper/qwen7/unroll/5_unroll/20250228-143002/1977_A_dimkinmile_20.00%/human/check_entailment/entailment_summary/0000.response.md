Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.
- To have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, `n` must be greater than or equal to `m`. This is because every time a cube is added, `m` increases by 1, and every time a cube is removed, `m` decreases by 1.
- The provided program defines a function `func_1()` which correctly checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
- The program iterates over each test case and calls `func_1()` for each, which matches the problem requirements.
- The function does not return any value but prints the result directly, which is acceptable since the problem specifies printing 'Yes' or 'No'.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
