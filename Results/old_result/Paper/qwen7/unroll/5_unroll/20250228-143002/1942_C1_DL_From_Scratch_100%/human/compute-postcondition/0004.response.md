Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where for each test case, it accepts n, x, and y as integers. It also accepts a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices. Based on these inputs, the function determines and returns information about the chosen vertices for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case to analyze the given integers and possibly perform some operation or check conditions related to these integers. However, without the specific operations or checks mentioned in the problem statement, the exact functionality cannot be detailed further.
