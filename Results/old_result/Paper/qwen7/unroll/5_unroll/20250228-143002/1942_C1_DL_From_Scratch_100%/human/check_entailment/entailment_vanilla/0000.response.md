Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The key points are:
- We need to form triangles.
- The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
- Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
- We can add up to `y` more vertices, but in this version, `y = 0`.

### Key Observations
1. **Forming Triangles**: To form a triangle, we need to connect three vertices with diagonals such that no two diagonals intersect inside the polygon.
2. **Non-Intersecting Diagonals**: For a polygon with `k` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `k - 2`.
3. **Given Constraints**: Since `y = 0`, we cannot add any additional vertices. Thus, the number of vertices available for forming triangles is exactly `x`.

### Program Analysis
Let's break down the given program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Input Reading**:
   - `T`: Number of test cases.
   - For each test case, read `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - Read the chosen vertices `list0`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the list of chosen vertices (`list0`).

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - Initialize `count` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted list to count the gaps between consecutive vertices where the gap is exactly 1.
   - After the loop, check the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list, considering the circular nature of the polygon.

4. **Final Count**:
   - Print the result of `count + x - 2`.

### Correctness Check
- **Gap Counting**: The program correctly counts the gaps of length 1 between consecutive vertices.
- **Circular Nature**: The check for the gap between the first and last vertex handles the circular nature of the polygon.
- **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `count + x - 2` is correct because `count` gives the number of gaps of length 1, and adding `x - 2` accounts for the remaining vertices needed to form the required number of triangles.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
