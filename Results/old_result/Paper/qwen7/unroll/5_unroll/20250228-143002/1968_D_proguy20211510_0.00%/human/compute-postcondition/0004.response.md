Output State: **The output state depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. Since no specific inputs are given, we cannot determine a concrete output state. However, the output will be either 'Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha' based on the conditions inside the loop.**

To provide a specific output state, we would need to know the exact inputs for each iteration of the loop.
