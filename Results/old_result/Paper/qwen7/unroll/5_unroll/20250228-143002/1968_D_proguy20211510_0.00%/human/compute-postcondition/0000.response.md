Output State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'**

Explanation: The code defines two strings, `YES` and `NO`, with the values `'YES'` and `'NO'` respectively. These definitions do not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`). Therefore, the only changes are the assignments of the string values to `YES` and `NO`.
