Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `range()` function to iterate a specified number of times.
   - The value provided by `int(input())`: This determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the value provided by `int(input())` must be at least 1. This is because if the input is less than 1, the `range()` function will not generate any values, and thus the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the input provided to `int(input())` results in a non-zero positive integer. Since the exact input is not known beforehand, we can only ensure that the condition for the loop to execute is met.

Given the initial states:
- `YES` is 'YES'
- `NO` is 'NO'
- `MOD` is 1000000007
- `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'

None of these variables directly affect the loop's execution. Therefore, we only need to focus on ensuring that the loop can execute based on the input.

**Final State**:
State: **`int(input())` must be at least 1**
