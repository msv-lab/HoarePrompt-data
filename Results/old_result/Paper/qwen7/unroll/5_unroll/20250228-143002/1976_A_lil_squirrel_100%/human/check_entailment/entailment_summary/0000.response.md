Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
2. For each password, it separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
3. It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
4. It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
5. It iterates through the password to ensure there are no instances where a letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such an instance is found, it returns 'NO'.
6. If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

Given the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
