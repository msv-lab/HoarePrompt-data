You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
    if letters != sorted(letters):
        return 'NO'
    if digits != sorted(digits):
        return 'NO'
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    password = input().strip()
    print(func_1(n, password))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, and password is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
def func_1(n, password):
    letters = []
    digits = []
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isdigit():
            digits.append(ch)
        else:
            letters.append(ch)
        
    #State: Output State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and the list `letters` is sorted
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, and the list `digits` is sorted
    for i in range(len(password) - 1):
        if password[i].isalpha() and password[i + 1].isdigit():
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the string `password`, `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the string `password`, and the loop has executed without encountering any lowercase letter followed immediately by a digit, so it did not return 'NO'.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 20 (inclusive), and `password`, a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits. It separates the characters in `password` into two lists: one for letters and one for digits. The function then checks if both lists are sorted and ensures there are no instances where a letter is immediately followed by a digit. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly verifies whether a password meets the specified conditions for being strong. It checks the following:

1. **Letters and Digits**: The program separates letters and digits into two lists.
2. **Sorted Order**: It checks if both the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. **No Digit After Letter**: It ensures that there is no digit immediately following a letter.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly:
- For "12ac", it returns "YES" because letters are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
- For "123wa", it returns "NO" because the letters are not sorted.
- For "allllmost", it returns "YES" because letters are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
- For "ac123", it returns "NO" because there is a digit after a letter.
- For "011679", it returns "YES" because digits are sorted and there are no letters after digits.

Since the program correctly handles all the conditions and test cases provided, it is correct.
