Output State: **`letters` is an empty list, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, `password` is a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `digits` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `digits`. This does not affect the values of `letters`, `n`, or `password`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
