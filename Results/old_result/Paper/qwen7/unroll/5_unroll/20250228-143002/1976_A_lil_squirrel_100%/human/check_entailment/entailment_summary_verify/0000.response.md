Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step-by-step:

1. **Function Separation and Sorting Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It then checks if both lists are sorted using the `sorted()` function. This ensures that the letters and digits are in non-decreasing order as required.

2. **No Digit After Letter Check**:
   - The function iterates through the password and checks if a letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns "NO". This ensures that no digit appears after a letter.

3. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The program handles all the given test cases correctly:
     - For "12ac": Returns "YES" because letters are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
     - For "123wa": Returns "NO" because the letters are not sorted.
     - For "allllmost": Returns "YES" because letters are sorted and there are no digits after letters.
     - For "ac123": Returns "NO" because there is a digit after a letter.
     - For "011679": Returns "YES" because digits are sorted and there are no letters after digits.

Given that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description and handles all the test cases accurately, the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
