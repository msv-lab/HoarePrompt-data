You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and the number of sticks (n) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of unique stick lengths encountered (n), and the subsequent elements are the unique stick lengths (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) in ascending order; `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a stick length from `arr` and its value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in the original list.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, where each frequency is the count of occurrences of a unique stick length in the original list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the lengths of the sticks.
   - However, the function `func_1` is called with the stick lengths array, but no logic inside `func_1` actually uses this function to solve the problem.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It creates a frequency dictionary `freq` to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then calculates the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3 (`v // 3`), which means it counts how many sets of three sticks of the same length are available.
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of forming multiple polygons with different side lengths.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the maximum number of polygons that can be formed.
   - We should iterate over possible polygon sides (from 3 to the minimum stick length) and count how many complete polygons can be formed with the available sticks.
   - The result should be the sum of the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with each possible side length.

### Correct Implementation

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum stick length
    min_length = min(arr)
    
    max_polygons = 0
    for side in range(3, min_length + 1):
        polygons = sum(count // side for count in freq.values())
        max_polygons = max(max_polygons, polygons)
    
    print(max_polygons)
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect because it only considers polygons with sides equal to the most frequent stick length and does not account for forming multiple polygons with different side lengths.
