Output State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of unique stick lengths encountered (n), and the subsequent elements are the unique stick lengths (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) in ascending order; `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a stick length from `arr` and its value is the count of how many times that stick length appears in the original list.
