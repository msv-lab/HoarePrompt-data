Reasoning:
The given program has a logical flaw in the function `func_1`. The function aims to calculate the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed, but it incorrectly assumes that each unique stick length can form a polygon independently. Specifically, the function sums up the integer division of each unique stick length's frequency by 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the polygons must be constructed using all sides of equal length.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to group the sticks by their lengths and then determine how many complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) can be formed from each group. The limiting factor will be the group with the fewest number of complete polygons that can be formed.

Here is the corrected approach:
1. Group the sticks by their lengths.
2. For each group, determine how many complete polygons can be formed.
3. The result is the minimum number of complete polygons that can be formed across all groups.

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly implement this logic. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
