Reasoning:
The provided function attempts to solve the problem by reducing \(X\) to 1 through a series of operations (dividing by 2 for even numbers and subtracting 1 for odd numbers). The goal is to generate an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. However, the logic in the function does not correctly address the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The function reduces \(X\) to 1 by repeatedly dividing even numbers by 2 and subtracting 1 from odd numbers. This approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. Instead, the problem requires generating an array where the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

2. **Array Construction**: To achieve \(X\) increasing subsequences, one effective strategy is to use a combination of repeated elements. For instance, an array like `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...]` can be constructed to have a specific number of increasing subsequences. The function does not implement this logic.

3. **Output Format**: The function prints the number of steps \(t\) and the list `ans`, which does not align with the requirement to output an array of integers with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
