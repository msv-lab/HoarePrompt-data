Output State: t is the number of steps required to reduce x to 1 by repeatedly dividing even numbers by 2 and subtracting 1 from odd numbers until x becomes 1. ans is a list containing integers where max starts at 100000000 and decreases by 1 for each even division, and min starts at -100000000 and increases by 1 for each subtraction until x becomes 1; the list is reversed before printing.
