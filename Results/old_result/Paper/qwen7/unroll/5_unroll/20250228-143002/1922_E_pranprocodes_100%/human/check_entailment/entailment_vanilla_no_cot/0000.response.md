Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the while loop is flawed and does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Generating Increasing Subsequences**: The current approach tries to generate numbers by alternating between the maximum and minimum values, which does not guarantee the desired number of increasing subsequences. It simply alternates between adding the largest and smallest possible values, which is not a reliable method for generating the exact number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling of `X`**: The program attempts to reduce `X` by dividing it by 2 when `X` is even, and subtracting 1 when `X` is odd. This approach does not correctly map to the number of increasing subsequences that can be formed.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is a prime number or when it cannot be decomposed into a form that allows the construction of an array with the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one needs to use a more sophisticated approach, such as factorizing `X` and constructing the array based on the factors. For example, if `X` can be expressed as a product of Fibonacci numbers (a known result in combinatorics), then the array can be constructed accordingly.

Here is a more appropriate approach:

```python
def func():
    def get_fibonacci_factors(n):
        factors = []
        fibs = [1, 1]
        while fibs[-1] <= n:
            fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
        fibs.pop()  # Remove the last element since it exceeds n
        i = len(fibs) - 1
        while n > 0 and i >= 0:
            if n >= fibs[i]:
                factors.append(fibs[i])
                n -= fibs[i]
            i -= 1
        return factors

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        factors = get_fibonacci_factors(x)
        if not factors:
            print(-1)
        else:
            length = sum(factors) - 1
            print(length)
            print(' '.join(map(str, factors)))
```

This approach uses the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be related to the Fibonacci numbers, making it possible to construct the required array.
