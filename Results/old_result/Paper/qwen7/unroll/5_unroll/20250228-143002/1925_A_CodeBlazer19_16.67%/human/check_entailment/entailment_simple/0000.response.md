### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Character Generation**:
   - The program generates a string `s` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This is done correctly using the range `97` to `k + 97` and converting these ASCII values to characters.
   
3. **Output Determination**:
   - When `k == 1`, the program prints `n` times the string `'a'`. This is correct because the only possible string of length `n` using the first character ('a') is `n` repetitions of 'a'.
   - When `k > 1`, the program prints the generated string `s` repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times. This is also correct. The logic ensures that the string `s` is used to form all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. The factor `(2 - (n == 1))` ensures that the string is repeated enough times to cover all possible subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case when `n == 1` and `k == 1` correctly by printing a single 'a'.
   - It also handles the case where `k > 1` and `n > 1` by repeating the string `s` appropriately.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement, producing a single string for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
