Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 26` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 26`. For each test case, it constructs a string containing characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k+96`. If `k` is 1, it prints the constructed string repeated `n` times. If `k` is greater than 1, it prints the constructed string repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times. The function outputs these strings for all test cases, with the total number of strings printed equal to the value of `t`.**
