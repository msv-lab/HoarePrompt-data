Output State: The output state will consist of multiple strings printed based on the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `k` is 1, it will print `n` times the string 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it will print `(2 - (n == 1))` times the string containing characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k + 97 - 1`. The total number of strings printed will be equal to the value of `t`.
