Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, the value of `n` is read from input, and the string `a` is read. The program then checks the number of '1's in `a`. If there are no '1's, it prints 'YES'. If there are more than 2 '1's and the count is even, it also prints 'YES'. If there are exactly 2 '1's, it checks if they are adjacent; if they are, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. For any other case, it prints 'NO'.

Each line of output corresponds to one iteration of the loop.
