### Reasoning:

The provided code snippet is for a different function (`func()`) than the one defined in the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function. Therefore, we need to focus only on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated program.

1. **Function Description**: The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is supposed to create `.py` files (`.ac.py` and `.wa.py`) for each `.html` file found within subdirectories whose names are digits and fall within the specified range `[start, end]`.

2. **Annotated Program**:
   - Before the function call, `start` and `end` are integers with `start <= end`.
   - The function iterates over all subdirectories in the current working directory.
   - It checks if the subdirectory name is a digit and falls within the specified range.
   - If so, it lists all `.html` files in that subdirectory.
   - For each `.html` file, it creates two new files: one named `<base_name>-ac.py` and another named `<base_name>-wa.py`, where `<base_name>` is the name of the `.html` file without the extension.
   - It prints the number of `.html` files found in each qualifying subdirectory and the generated `.py` files.

3. **Execution States**:
   - The annotated program correctly describes the expected behavior of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.
   - The function iterates through the directories, checks the conditions, and performs the necessary operations as described.

Given the above points, the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the annotated program.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
