Output State: **The program returns 'YES'**

This means that after iterating through all elements in `nums`, the variable `curr` does not become less than 0 at any point, indicating that the sum of all differences from the mean is exactly `-n`. Since the function does not return 'NO' during the iteration, it concludes by returning 'YES'.
