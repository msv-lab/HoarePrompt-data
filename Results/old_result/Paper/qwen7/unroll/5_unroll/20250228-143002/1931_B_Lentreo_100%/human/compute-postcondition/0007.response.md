Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is typically initialized to 0 at the beginning of the loop.
   - The variable `n` is the length of the list `nums`.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - `n` is the length of `nums`, so we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial states:
- `curr` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop execution).
- `nums` is a list of integers (its length `n` is important).
- `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums` (not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n` (not directly relevant to the loop execution).

Therefore, the only variables that need adjustment are `i` and `n`. We know `i` is initialized to 0, and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
