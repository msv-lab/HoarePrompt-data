Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The program attempts to check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by ensuring that the sum of water in each container can be evenly distributed. However, the function `func_1` is checking if the current cumulative difference from the mean is negative, which is not the correct approach for solving this problem.

The correct approach should be to verify if the total sum of water divided by the number of containers (`n`) results in an integer (which it is guaranteed to do according to the problem statement). After confirming this, we need to ensure that it is possible to redistribute the water so that each container ends up with the average amount of water. This can be done by checking if the cumulative difference from the mean ever becomes negative during the iteration, which would indicate that it is impossible to achieve the desired distribution.

However, the provided code does not actually perform the necessary redistribution checks. Instead, it only checks if the cumulative difference from the mean becomes negative, which is not sufficient to determine the possibility of redistribution.

Given the provided execution summary, the program is not correctly implementing the logic required to solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
