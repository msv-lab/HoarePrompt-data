The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. The length of `nums` is `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). The function returns either 'YES' or 'NO'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 'YES' if it's possible to partition the list into `n` non-empty parts such that the sum of each part is equal, otherwise it returns 'NO'.**
