Output State: curr is -1, nums is a list of integers, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of all elements in nums, and mean is the integer division of total by n.

Explanation: After iterating through the loop, the value of `curr` is calculated by adding the difference between each element in `nums` and `mean` to `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. Since the problem does not specify the exact values in `nums`, we can only say that after completing all iterations, `curr` will be the sum of all elements in `nums` minus `n` times `mean`. If this sum is negative, the function would return 'NO' before completing all iterations, but since no specific values are given, we assume it goes through all iterations and the final state of `curr` is -1 (this is a hypothetical example as the actual value depends on the input). The other variables (`nums`, `n`, `total`, and `mean`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
