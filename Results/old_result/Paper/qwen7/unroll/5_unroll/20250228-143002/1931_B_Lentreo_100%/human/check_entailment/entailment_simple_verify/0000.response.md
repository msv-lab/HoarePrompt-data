### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. This is a necessary condition for the containers to have the same amount of water after some operations. If the sum is not divisible by `n`, the program returns 'NO', which is correct.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`). This is the target amount of water each container needs to achieve to have the same amount.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the mean can be balanced out without going negative. This is done by maintaining a running sum `curr` of the differences between each element and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, it means it's impossible to balance the containers to have the same amount, and the program returns 'NO'.
   - If the loop completes without returning, `curr` will be the sum of all differences from the mean, which should be 0 because the total sum of water is divisible by `n`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initial State**:
  - `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container.
  - `n` is the length of `nums`.
  - `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.
  - `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.

- **Balance Check Logic**:
  - The variable `curr` is initialized to 0.
  - For each container, the difference between the current amount of water and the mean is added to `curr`.
  - If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, it means the current distribution cannot be balanced to have the same amount in all containers, and the program returns 'NO'.
  - If the loop completes without returning, `curr` will be 0 because the total sum of water is divisible by `n`, and the program returns 'YES'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided test cases.
