Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Here's why:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**: The program first checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to make all containers have the same amount of water if the total sum is not divisible by `n`.

2. **Mean Calculation**: If the sum is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container, checking if the difference between the current amount of water and the mean can be balanced out without going negative. If at any point the difference goes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the containers to have the same amount, and the program returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem description and examples.
