Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of containers (`n`) and the amounts of water in each container (`nums`).
3. The function `func_1(nums)` is called with the list of water amounts for each test case.
4. Inside `func_1(nums)`, the program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
5. If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the mean amount of water per container.
6. It then iterates through the list `nums` and accumulates the difference between each element and the mean in `curr`.
7. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, it means that the distribution of water cannot be made equal, so it returns 'NO'.
8. If the loop completes without returning 'NO', `curr` will be -n, indicating that the distribution can indeed be made equal, so it returns 'YES'.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations.

Correctness: **True**
