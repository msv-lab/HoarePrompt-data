State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. The loop can only execute if `t` is a non-negative integer, but since `range(t)` does not include 0 (it goes from 0 to `t-1`), `t` must be strictly greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
3. No other variables or states outside the loop head (`_`) need adjustment because they are not involved in determining the loop's execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
