Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code initializes `i` to 0, which does not affect the list `arr`. Therefore, the length and content of `arr` remain unchanged from its initial state.
