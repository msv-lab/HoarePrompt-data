### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The provided solution iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 to find the largest \( y \) that satisfies the condition \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing `max_val` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \% y == 0 \) (i.e., \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \)).
   - If \( y \) is a divisor and \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If no such \( y \) is found, it returns `max_val`, which is initialized to 1.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \( x \) is prime, the only divisors are 1 and \( x \) itself. Since \( y \) must be less than \( x \), the only possible \( y \) is 1. This matches the behavior of the function.
   - When \( x \) is not prime, the function correctly finds the largest \( y \) such that \( 2 \cdot y \geq x \).

4. **Output Validation**:
   - Given the examples in the problem statement, the function's logic appears to work correctly for all provided test cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the desired \( y \) for each \( x \). Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
