Reasoning:
1. The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
2. The annotated program correctly calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
3. It then creates a list `vprod` where each element is `prod` divided by each corresponding element in the input list `vals`.
4. The variable `den` is calculated as `prod - sum(vprod)`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
5. If `den` is greater than 0, it prints the list `vprod`, which represents a valid distribution of bets.

However, there is an issue with the logic:
- The calculation of `vprod` assumes that the sum of `vprod` should be strictly less than `prod` for a valid solution. But the problem requires the total bet to be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, which means the sum of `vprod` should be strictly less than any individual `k_i * vprod[i]`.

Given the logic in the annotated program, it checks if the sum of `vprod` is less than `prod`, but it does not ensure that the sum of `vprod` is less than each individual `k_i * vprod[i]`.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
