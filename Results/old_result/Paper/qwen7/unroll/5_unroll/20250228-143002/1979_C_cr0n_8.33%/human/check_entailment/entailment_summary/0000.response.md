Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The program calculates `vprod` as the product of all elements divided by each individual element. This does not ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   
2. **Denominator Check**: The program checks if `den = prod - sum(vprod)` is less than or equal to zero and prints `-1` if true. However, this check alone is insufficient to guarantee that the solution is valid according to the problem statement.

3. **Solution Validity**: The problem requires that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. The current approach does not ensure this condition is met.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
