Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks out of `n` sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three sticks to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and the exponents (`a_i`) which determine the lengths of the sticks as \(2^{a_i}\).
   - It then counts the occurrences of each exponent using `num_of_lens`.
   - The logic to count the number of valid triangles is as follows:
     - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same exponent, they can form a triangle among themselves, contributing \(\binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6}\) ways.
     - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same exponent, they can pair with any other stick, contributing \(cnt \times (cnt - 1) / 2 \times \text{total\_count}\) ways, where `total_count` is the cumulative count of sticks processed so far.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for counting combinations of sticks with the same exponent is correct.
   - The way the code handles different cases (at least 3 sticks, at least 2 sticks) is appropriate for forming triangles.
   - The final output is correctly printed for each test case.

Based on the above analysis, the given code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
