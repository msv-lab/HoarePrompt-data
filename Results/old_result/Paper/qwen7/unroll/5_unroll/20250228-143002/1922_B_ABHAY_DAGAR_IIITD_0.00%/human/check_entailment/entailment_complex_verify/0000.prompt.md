You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Output

    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of ways to choose three sticks with the same exponent such that their combined length is divisible by 3, plus the number of ways to choose two sticks with the same exponent and multiply it by the number of sticks already considered, for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The output state is a list of integers where each integer is the value printed by `print(result)` for each corresponding `result` in the original `results` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. It calculates the number of ways to choose three sticks with the same exponent such that their combined length is divisible by 3, and the number of ways to choose two sticks with the same exponent and multiply it by the number of sticks already considered, for each test case. The function then prints these calculated values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 1 2 3
```

The program will output `4`, but the correct answer should be `0` because no combination of three sticks can satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. The possible combinations are (2^0, 2^1, 2^2), (2^0, 2^1, 2^3), (2^0, 2^2, 2^3), and (2^1, 2^2, 2^3), and none of these can form a triangle.

To fix this, the program needs to check the triangle inequality condition before counting the valid combinations.
