test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n representing the number of sticks, and a list of integers a where the i-th integer represents the exponent for the i-th stick's length (2^{a_i}). The value of n satisfies 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and for each stick, 0 <= a_i <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
