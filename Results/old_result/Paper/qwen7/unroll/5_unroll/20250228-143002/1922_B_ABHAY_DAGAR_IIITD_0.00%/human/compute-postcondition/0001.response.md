Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(test_cases):`. The only variable involved here is `test_cases`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer because the `range()` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, if `test_cases` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since `test_cases` is the only variable involved in the loop head and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0.

4. **Consider the other given states**: The state of `results` being an empty list (`[]`) is not directly relevant to the loop's execution condition but is part of the overall program state. It doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `test_cases` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
