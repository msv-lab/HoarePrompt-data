Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `result`, which is being iterated over from the list `results`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `results`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `results` is not an empty list.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop body is omitted, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by making sure `results` is not empty. Additionally, since `result` is used in the loop, we need to ensure that `result` is properly initialized or set to the first element of the list before the loop starts.

4. **State Adjustment**: Given that `results` is a list of integers, and the loop will iterate over each element in this list, the initial state should reflect that `results` is not empty and contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `results` must be a non-empty list containing at least one integer.

State: **`results` is a list of integers that must not be empty**
