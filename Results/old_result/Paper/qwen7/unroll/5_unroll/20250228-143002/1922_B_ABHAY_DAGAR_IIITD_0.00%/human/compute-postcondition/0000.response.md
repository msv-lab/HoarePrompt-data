Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the `test_cases` variable, so it remains as initially described. The `results` list is now an empty list.
