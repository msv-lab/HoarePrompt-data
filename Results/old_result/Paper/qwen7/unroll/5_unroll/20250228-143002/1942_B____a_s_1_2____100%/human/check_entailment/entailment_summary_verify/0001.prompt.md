You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a new list `p` of `n` integers based on the formula `p[i] = mex - a[i]`, where `mex` is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list `p` so far. After processing all test cases, it outputs the list `p` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program to see if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the provided array \( a \).

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
2. **Array \( p \) Initialization**: It initializes an array \( p \) of size \( n \) with all elements set to -1.
3. **Backward Construction**: It iterates backward through the array \( a \) from index \( n-1 \) to 0. For each index \( i \):
   - It sets \( p[i] \) to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \), where \( \text{mex} \) is the current minimum value in the array \( p \).
   - It updates \( \text{mex} \) to be the minimum of the current \( \text{mex} \) and the newly assigned value \( p[i] \).

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by simply setting \( \text{mex} \) to the minimum value in the array \( p \). This is not correct because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array \( p \) up to that point.
   - For example, if \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \), the MEX would be 5, but the program would incorrectly set \( \text{mex} \) to 2 (the minimum value in \( p \)).

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program updates \( \text{mex} \) after assigning \( p[i] \), which can lead to incorrect values of \( p \) because \( \text{mex} \) is being updated based on the current state of \( p \), which includes the newly assigned value \( p[i] \).

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a separate data structure to keep track of the elements that have already appeared in \( p \). Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, the original program is incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
