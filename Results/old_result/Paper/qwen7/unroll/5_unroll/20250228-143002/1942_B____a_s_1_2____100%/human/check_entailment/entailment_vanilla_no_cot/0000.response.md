Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several logical errors and issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `mex`**: The logic to calculate the `mex` value is flawed. The variable `mex` should be updated based on the values in the permutation `p` as they are being constructed, not just the current minimum value.

2. **Reversing the Loop**: The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0`, which is incorrect because the `mex` value should be determined based on the already constructed part of the permutation, not the remaining part.

3. **Updating `mex` Incorrectly**: The `mex` value should be updated based on the values in `p` as they are assigned, not just the current minimum value.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = 0
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] >= 0:
                p[i] = a[i]
                used.add(a[i])
            else:
                while mex in used:
                    mex += 1
                p[i] = mex
                used.add(mex)
        
        print(*p)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the `mex` value is correctly calculated and updated based on the constructed permutation `p`. It also handles the case where `a[i]` is negative by finding the next available `mex` value.
