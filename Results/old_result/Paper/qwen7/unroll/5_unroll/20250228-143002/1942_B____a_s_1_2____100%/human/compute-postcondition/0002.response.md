Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and p is a list of n integers where each element is calculated based on the formula p[i] = mex - a[i] with mex being updated accordingly. After all iterations, p contains the results of these calculations for each input.
