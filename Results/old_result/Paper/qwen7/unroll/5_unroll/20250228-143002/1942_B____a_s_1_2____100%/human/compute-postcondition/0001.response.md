State before the loop starts: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
2. The only variable involved in the loop head is `t`.
3. Whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`.
4. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` must be at least 1**
