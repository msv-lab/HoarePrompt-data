Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. All other variables remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained within the range of 1 to 10^4. The initial conditions for `n` and `a` remain unaltered as they are defined later in the code.
