### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the original assessment step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

#### Original Assessment Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by setting `mex` to the minimum value in the array `p`. This is not correct because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `p` up to that point.
   - For example, if `p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, the MEX would be 5, but the program would incorrectly set `mex` to 2 (the minimum value in `p`).

2. **Incorrect Order of Operations**:
   - The program updates `mex` after assigning `p[i]`, which can lead to incorrect values of `p` because `mex` is being updated based on the current state of `p`, which includes the newly assigned value `p[i]`.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to maintain a separate data structure to keep track of the elements that have already appeared in `p`. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

#### Analysis of the Given Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Array `p` Initialization**:
   - It initializes an array `p` of size `n` with all elements set to -1.
   - It also initializes `mex` to `n`.

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - It iterates backward through the array `a` from index `n-1` to 0.
   - For each index `i`:
     - It sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]`.
     - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of the current `mex` and the newly assigned value `p[i]`.

#### Issues Identified:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the MEX by setting `mex` to the minimum value in the array `p`. This is not correct because the MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `p` up to that point.
- **Incorrect Order of Operations**: The program updates `mex` after assigning `p[i]`, which can lead to incorrect values of `p` because `mex` is being updated based on the current state of `p`, which includes the newly assigned value `p[i]`.

#### Corrected Program:
The corrected program uses a set to keep track of the elements that have already appeared in `p`. This ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated as the smallest non-negative integer not present in `p` up to that point.

#### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues with the MEX calculation and the order of operations. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the program. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
