### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`. To maximize this sum, we need to minimize the negative contributions and maximize the positive contributions.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible elements, minimizing the negative contributions and maximizing the positive contributions.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading and processing of multiple test cases, storing the results, and printing them.

4. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - `func_1` correctly computes the beauty of a sorted array, which is the optimal solution for maximizing the beauty.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` to compute the required results.
   - The overall logic aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
