Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 representing the length of the array, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

This means that the `input().split()` function has been called, which reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings stored in the variable `data`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
