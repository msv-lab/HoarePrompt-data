The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters. It processes a set of test cases internally, where for each test case, it takes `t` as the number of test cases, `n` as the length of the array (with 2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `array` as a list of `n` integers each in the range [1, 10^9]. The function calculates the maximum beauty for each test case and stores the result in the `results` list. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, calculating the maximum beauty for each case based on an array of integers and storing the results in a list.**
