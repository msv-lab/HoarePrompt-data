Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is assigned the value `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 representing the length of the array, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

Explanation: The line `index = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain the same as in the initial state.
