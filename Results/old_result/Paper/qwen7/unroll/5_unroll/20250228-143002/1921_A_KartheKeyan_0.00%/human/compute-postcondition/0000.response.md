Output State: **There are four lines, each containing two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area; n is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the while loop, and s is updated according to the formula \(s += (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2\) for each value of l read from input.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of iterations for the while loop. For each iteration, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the given formula, prints `s`, and then decrements `n` by 1. The initial conditions about the coordinates of the square remain unchanged, but `n` is updated after each iteration of the loop.
