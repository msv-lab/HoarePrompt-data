You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: The list `list` undergoes modifications based on the conditions within the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i+1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`, `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. After all iterations, if no early termination occurs, the final state of the list `list` is the result of these operations.
    #
    #If the loop completes without printing 'no', the output state will be a modified version of the initial list where each element has been adjusted according to the specified rules.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: The list `list` undergoes modifications based on the conditions within the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i+1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`, `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. After all iterations, if no early termination occurs, the final state of the list `list` is the result of these operations. Regardless of whether `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True or False, the final state of the list remains consistent with the described operations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It returns a value based on specific conditions related to the elements in the list and the value of n.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
