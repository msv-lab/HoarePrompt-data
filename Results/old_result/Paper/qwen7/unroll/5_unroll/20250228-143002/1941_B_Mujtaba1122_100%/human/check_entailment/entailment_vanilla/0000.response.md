Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1, and if so, it performs the following operations:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - After performing these operations, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still non-zero. If it is, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding a non-zero `list[i-1]`, it calls `func_1` to check if the entire array is now zero.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Correctness Check

To determine if the program is correct, we need to verify two things:
1. The operations performed in `func_2` are valid according to the problem statement.
2. The logic in `func_2` correctly determines whether the array can be reduced to all zeros.

#### Validity of Operations
The operations in `func_2` are exactly as described in the problem statement:
- `a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1`
- `a_i = a_i - 2`
- `a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1`

So, the operations are valid.

#### Logic Verification
- The function `func_2` iterates through the array and applies the operations when necessary.
- If at any point, the operation cannot be applied (i.e., `list[i-1]` becomes zero but `list[i]` is still greater than 1), it correctly identifies that it is impossible to make all elements zero and prints 'NO'.
- If the loop completes and `func_1` confirms that all elements are zero, it prints 'YES'.

This logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
