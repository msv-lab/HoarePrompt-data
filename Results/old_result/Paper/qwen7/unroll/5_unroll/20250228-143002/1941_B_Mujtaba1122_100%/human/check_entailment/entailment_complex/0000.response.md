Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - If any element is non-zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function correctly identifies if the list can be made entirely zero.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 and applies the operation whenever possible.
   - If at any point, the operation cannot be applied (i.e., the conditions are not met), it prints 'no' and returns.
   - If the loop completes without printing 'no', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_2` with the array and its size.
   - The output is determined based on the logic implemented in `func_2`.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the logic in `func_2` is designed to ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the array is all zeros, which is essential for determining the final output.

Since the logic in `func_2` correctly implements the problem requirements and the `func_1` function accurately checks for the condition of all zeros, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
