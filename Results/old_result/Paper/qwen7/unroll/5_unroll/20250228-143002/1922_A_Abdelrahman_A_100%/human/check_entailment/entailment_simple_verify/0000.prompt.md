You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')

            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), the program checks if character `c` is in strings `a` or `b`. If `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` is present in the corresponding part of `a` and `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The output state will be a list of 'YES' and 'NO' for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template that matches both `a` and `b` but not `c`. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, and if not, it assumes a template exists without further validation. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the conditions for matching the template are met for all positions.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- The program will output "YES" because `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`.
- However, there is no template that would make `a` and `b` match while making `c` not match. Any template that makes `a` and `b` match would also allow `c` to match if `c` has the same characters in the same positions as `a` or `b`.

Thus, the program fails to correctly handle this case, making it incorrect.
