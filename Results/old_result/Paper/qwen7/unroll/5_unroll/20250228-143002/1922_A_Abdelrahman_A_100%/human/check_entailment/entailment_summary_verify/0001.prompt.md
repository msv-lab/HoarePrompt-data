You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    a
    
    b

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are each of length \(n\) (with \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)), and \(c\) is also of length \(n\). For each test case, the function checks if \(c\) contains any character not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) contains any such character, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in \(c\) is present in the corresponding positions in \(a\) and \(b\). If any character in \(c\) is not found in both \(a\) and \(b\), it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length Reading**: For each test case, it correctly reads the length of the strings (`slength`).
3. **Initial Check**: The initial check `if c == a or c == b:` ensures that if `c` matches either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO" because `c` would match the same template as `a` and `b`. This is a valid approach.
4. **Template Validation Loop**: The loop `for x in c:` iterates through each character of `c`. It checks if the character `x` is not present in both `a` and `b` at the corresponding index. If this condition holds true, it sets `no` to `False` and prints "YES", breaking out of the loop early.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, if `no` remains `True`, it prints "NO", indicating that no suitable template exists.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:
- The check `if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:` should be `if x != a[counter] and x != b[counter]:` to ensure that the character in `c` is different from the corresponding characters in `a` and `b`.
- The loop should compare each character of `c` with the corresponding character in `a` and `b` to ensure that the conditions for matching the template are met.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for j in range(slength):
                if a[j].isupper() and c[j].islower() and c[j] == a[j].lower():
                    no = False
                    print('NO')
                    break
                elif b[j].isupper() and c[j].islower() and c[j] == b[j].lower():
                    no = False
                    print('NO')
                    break
                elif a[j].islower() and c[j] != a[j]:
                    continue
                elif b[j].islower() and c[j] != b[j]:
                    continue
                else:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')
```
