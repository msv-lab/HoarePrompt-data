Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her own array `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, with Alice aiming to maximize it and Bob to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice can strategically pick elements to ensure that the sequence in `c` is as large as possible without gaps.
   - Bob will remove elements to create gaps in the sequence of numbers in `c`.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If `a` contains all numbers from `0` to `n-1`, the optimal strategy for Alice would be to pick elements in increasing order, ensuring the MEX is minimized by Bob.
   - If `a` lacks some numbers, Bob can exploit these gaps to reduce the MEX.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` and the list `N`.
   - It sorts the list `N`.
   - It then iterates through the sorted list to determine the maximum value `cur` such that there are no gaps in the sequence from `0` to `cur-1`.
   - This approach ensures that Alice can pick elements in a way that minimizes the gaps created by Bob.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the maximum value `cur` such that there are no gaps in the sequence from `0` to `cur-1`.
   - This aligns with the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the MEX and Bob to minimize it.
   - The program handles the constraints and examples provided correctly.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the optimal MEX for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
