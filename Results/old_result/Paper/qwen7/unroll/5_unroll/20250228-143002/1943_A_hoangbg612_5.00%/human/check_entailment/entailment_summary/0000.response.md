Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the List**: The list `N` is sorted, which is a necessary step to facilitate the determination of the MEX.
3. **Determining MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the sorted list `N`.
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and updates the dictionary `M` and the variable `cur` based on the following logic:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
     - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
4. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - If the sum of the counts in the dictionary `M` equals the length of the list `N`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates through the numbers from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of the number `i` in the dictionary `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
5. **Output**: The final value of `cur` is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` formed during the game. The program handles the sorting and counting of elements in the list `N` and correctly identifies the MEX based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

Therefore, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
