Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described. Specifically, the program does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, and it does not properly handle the process of appending elements to `c` and removing them from `a`. Instead, it sorts the array and tries to find the minimum excludant (MEX) based on a different logic that does not reflect the game's rules.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output based on the problem description is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program does not produce these results. It incorrectly calculates the MEX without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
