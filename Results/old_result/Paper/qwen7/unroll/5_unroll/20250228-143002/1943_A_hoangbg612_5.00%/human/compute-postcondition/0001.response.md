Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder for the loop index) and the variable `T`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `T`**: The initial state given is that `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

3. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is greater than 0. Since `T` is a positive integer, the loop will always execute as long as `T` is within the specified range.

4. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `T` must be greater than 0. Given that `T` is a positive integer, this condition is already satisfied.

5. **Final State**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `T`, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**.
