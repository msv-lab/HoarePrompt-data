Output State: **`t` is an integer input representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`t`). This integer is then converted to an integer type and assigned to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state, which in this case means they retain their implied initial state (not specified but typically non-existent or default).
