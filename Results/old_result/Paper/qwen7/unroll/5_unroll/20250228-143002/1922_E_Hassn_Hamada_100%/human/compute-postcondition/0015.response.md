Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^18], and `sequence`, a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If `number` is 0, the function returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and appends these numbers to `sequence`. Finally, the function recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns (0, 0).**
