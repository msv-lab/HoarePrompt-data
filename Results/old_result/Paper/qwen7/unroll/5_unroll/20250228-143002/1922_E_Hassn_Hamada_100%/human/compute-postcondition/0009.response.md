Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(size - overlap)` will execute as long as `size - overlap` is at least 1.
   - Given that `size` is currently 1 and `overlap` is 0, the expression `size - overlap` evaluates to `1 - 0`, which is 1.
   - Since 1 is at least 1, the loop will execute once.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - The loop will start with `i` being 0 (the default starting value of the `range` function).
   - After the first iteration, `i` will become 1, but since the loop only runs once, we don't need to adjust `i` beyond its initial value for the loop to execute.

4. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `size` should remain 1.
   - `overlap` should remain 0.
   - `i` should be 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

**State: **`size` is 1, `overlap` is 0, `i` is 0**
