Output State: **size is 1, overlap is 0, sequence is [0], number is number - (1 << 1) + (1 << 0)**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called with the arguments `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)` and `sequence`. Given the initial state where `size` is 1, `overlap` is 0, and `sequence` is `[0]`, the argument to `func_1` is calculated as `number - (1 << 1) + (1 << 0)`, which simplifies to `number - 2 + 1` or `number - 1`. The values of `size`, `overlap`, and `sequence` remain unchanged.
