Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a test case where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 (inclusive), and `x` is a list of `n-1` integers each between 1 and 500 (inclusive). The function returns a result based on these inputs.**
