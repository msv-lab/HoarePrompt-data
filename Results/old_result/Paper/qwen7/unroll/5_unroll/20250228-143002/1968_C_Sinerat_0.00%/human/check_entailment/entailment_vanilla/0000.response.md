Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `x`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500.

3. **Filling the Array**:
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The array `a` is printed.

### Checking Against the Problem Description:

- **Constraints**:
  - The constraints are respected (e.g., `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `2 ≤ n ≤ 500`, `1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500`).

- **Array Construction**:
  - The construction logic `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]` ensures that `a_i` is at least `a_{i-1}` plus some positive value.
  - This guarantees that `a_i > a_{i-1}` for all `i`.

- **Modulo Condition**:
  - The condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` needs to be checked.
  - Given `a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]`, we have:
    \[
    a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a[i-1] + x[i-1]) \bmod a_{i-1} = x[i-1]
    \]
  - This matches the requirement since `x[i-1]` is exactly what is needed for the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. The initialization of `a[0]` to 500 and the subsequent additions ensure that the modulo condition holds true.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
