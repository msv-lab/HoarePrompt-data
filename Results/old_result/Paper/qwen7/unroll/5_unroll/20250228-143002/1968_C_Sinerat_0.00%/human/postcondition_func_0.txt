The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list `x` of `n-1` integers. It then constructs a list `a` of length `n` starting with `a[0] = 500` and each subsequent element `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] + x[i-1]`. Finally, it prints the list `a` for each test case.
