t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. Additionally, there are two lists of integers a and x, where both lists have length n, and the elements of x are unique, sorted in strictly increasing order, and satisfy -n ≤ x_i ≤ n with x_i ≠ 0 for all i.
