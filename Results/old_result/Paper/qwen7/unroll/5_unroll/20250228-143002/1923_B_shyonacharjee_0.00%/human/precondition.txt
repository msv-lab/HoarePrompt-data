t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. The lists a and x are both of length n, where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and each element x_i is an integer such that -n ≤ x_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0, with the condition that x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n.
