Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: The state right before the loop is that `t` is an integer obtained from input, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`).

Given that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, it is already guaranteed to be a non-zero integer. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

Since no adjustments are needed, we can simply repeat the provided state.

**State: **`t` is an integer obtained from input, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4**
