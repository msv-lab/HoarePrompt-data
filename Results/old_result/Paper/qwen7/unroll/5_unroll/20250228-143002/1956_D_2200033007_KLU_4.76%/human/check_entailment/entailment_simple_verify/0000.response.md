### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step based on the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into the list `a`.
   - The annotated code confirms that `a` is a list of integers where the length `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 18\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).

2. **Function Call:**
   - The program calls `func_1(len(a))`, passing the length of the array `a` to the function.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an argument `c`, which is the length of the array `a`.
   - If `c` is 2, the function prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This corresponds to the first example in the problem statement.
   - If `c` is not 2, the function prints `13 0`. This corresponds to the second example in the problem statement.

Now, let's consider the problem requirements:
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` using up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX of that subarray.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` does not actually process the array `a` to find the MEX values or perform any operations to maximize the sum.
- For `c = 2`, the hardcoded solution is correct because the MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`, and setting both elements to `2` gives a sum of `4`.
- For `c \neq 2`, the hardcoded solution is also correct because the MEX of any array of length greater than 2 is `0`, and setting all elements to `0` gives a sum of `13`.

However, the problem requires a dynamic approach to handle any input length within the specified constraints. The current implementation does not generalize this behavior and relies on hardcoded values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem dynamically. It only handles specific cases (lengths 2 and 1) and does not provide a way to calculate the MEX value or perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements for general cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
