### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version against the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into the list `a`.
   - The annotated code confirms that `a` is a list of integers where the length of the list `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 18\), and each element \(a_i\) of the list satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `c` as input.
   - For \(c = 2\), it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - For any other length of `c`, it prints "13 0".

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` does not process the actual input array `a` or compute the MEX value.
   - It simply hardcodes the results based on the length of the input array, which is not a solution to the problem.
   - The hardcoded values "4 1" and "1 2" for \(c = 2\) and "13 0" for other lengths do not reflect the correct strategy to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing the allowed operations.

4. **Problem Requirements:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.
   - The provided function does not implement this logic at all.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to process the input array and compute the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. It hardcodes results without actually processing the input data or performing the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
