Output State: The output state will consist of lines printed during the execution of the loop. For each test case, it will first print pairs of numbers from the array `a` where the number appears exactly twice, up to `k` such pairs. If there are not enough pairs to make `k`, it will print the remaining single occurrences of numbers from `a` until `k` is satisfied. After that, it will print the list of numbers that were printed as single occurrences. If the counts of pairs found on the left side (`l`) and right side (`r`) are not equal, it will continue to find and print pairs from the right side until the counts match.
