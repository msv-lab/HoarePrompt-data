Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, and the array `a`.
2. **Initialization**: Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store the selected elements for the left and right subsets, respectively.
3. **Counting Occurrences**: The program counts the occurrences of each element in both the first half and the second half of the array `a`. This is done using the loops that iterate through `l` and `r`.
4. **Constructing Left Subset (`l`)**: The program constructs the left subset `l` by selecting pairs of elements from the first half of `a` where the element appears exactly twice. If there are not enough such pairs, it then selects single occurrences of elements until `k` pairs are formed.
5. **Constructing Right Subset (`r`)**: The program constructs the right subset `r` by selecting pairs of elements from the second half of `a` where the element appears exactly twice. If there are not enough such pairs, it then selects single occurrences of elements until `k` pairs are formed.
6. **Output**: The program prints the constructed subsets `l` and `r` for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the logic:

- The variable names `ul` and `ur` are used to track the count of pairs in `l` and `r`, respectively, but they are not correctly updated in the loop.
- The logic to ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r` is missing.
- The program does not guarantee that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
