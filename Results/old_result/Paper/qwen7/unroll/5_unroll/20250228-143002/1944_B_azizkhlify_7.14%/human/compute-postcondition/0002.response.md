Output State: The output state will consist of lines of output based on the given conditions within the loop. For each test case, it will first print pairs of numbers from the array `a` where the number appears exactly twice, up to `k` such pairs. If there are not enough such pairs to make `k`, it will then print additional single occurrences of numbers from the array `a` until `k` is satisfied. After that, it will print the remaining numbers from the array `a` that were part of the `res` list. If at any point the counts of left (`ul`) and right (`ur`) occurrences match, the loop breaks early. The final output will be a series of these printed lines for each test case.
