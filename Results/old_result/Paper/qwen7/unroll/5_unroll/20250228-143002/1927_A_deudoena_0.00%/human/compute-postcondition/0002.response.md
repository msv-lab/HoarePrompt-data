Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'.**

Explanation: The code `ind2 = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `ind2`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
