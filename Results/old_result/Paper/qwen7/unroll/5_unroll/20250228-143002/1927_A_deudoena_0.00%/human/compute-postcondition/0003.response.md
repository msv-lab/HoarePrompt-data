Output State: **`ind1` is 0, `ind2` is 0, `inpstr` is the string input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B', `outind` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `outind`. Since `ind1` and `ind2` are not affected, their values remain unchanged. Similarly, `inpstr`, `t`, `n`, and `s` are also not affected by the code. Therefore, the only change is that `outind` is now 0.
