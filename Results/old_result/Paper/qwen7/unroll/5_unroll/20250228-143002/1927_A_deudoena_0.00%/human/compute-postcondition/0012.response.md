Functionality: **The function processes a string `inpstr` containing characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. After determining these indices (`ind1` and `ind2`), it calculates and prints the number of characters between the first and last 'B' (excluding the 'B' characters themselves). The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the result based on the input string.**
