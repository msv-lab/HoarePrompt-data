Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and stores the test cases.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case according to the problem's rules.
3. The logic within the loop checks if the robot can reach the last column of the second row from the first row, considering the direction of the arrows.
4. The variable `reachable_first_row` is used to track if the robot can stay in the first row.
5. The variable `reachable_second_row` is used to track if the robot can reach the second row.
6. The loop iterates through each column, updating the reachability based on the direction of the arrows.
7. After processing all columns, the function appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on whether the robot can reach the last column of the second row.
8. The final output matches the expected format and criteria.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
