### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given example.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We have a 2xN grid with arrows pointing either left ('<') or right ('>'). 
- The robot starts at (1, 1) and must reach (2, N).
- The robot moves according to the arrow in the current cell.
- The goal is to determine if the robot can reach (2, N).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- `func_1` processes each test case and determines if the robot can reach (2, N).
- It uses variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track if the robot can move to the second row.
- If the robot reaches the last column in the second row, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

#### Analysis of the Given Example:
Consider the input:
```
4
6
<>><><
><<>><
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- It moves right to (1, 2) and follows the arrow to (2, 2).
- From (2, 2), it moves right to (2, 3) and follows the arrow to (1, 3).
- From (1, 3), it moves right to (1, 4) and follows the arrow to (2, 4).
- From (2, 4), it moves right to (2, 5) and follows the arrow to (1, 5).
- From (1, 5), it moves right to (1, 6) and follows the arrow to (2, 6).

The program should output "YES" for this case, but it outputs "NO".

#### Detailed Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   reachable_first_row = True
   reachable_second_row = False
   ```

2. **Loop through each column**:
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       if reachable_first_row:
           if row1[j] == '>':
               if j == n - 1:
                   reachable_second_row = True
           else:
               reachable_first_row = False
               if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                   reachable_second_row = True
       if reachable_second_row:
           if row2[j] == '>':
               if j == n - 1:
                   reachable_second_row = True
   ```

3. **Final Check**:
   ```python
   if reachable_second_row:
       results.append('YES')
   else:
       results.append('NO')
   ```

#### Issues Identified:
- The logic only checks if the robot can reach the last column in the second row directly from the first row or the second row.
- It does not consider all possible paths that might involve multiple moves between the first and second rows.

#### Correct Approach:
- The program should simulate the robot's movement step-by-step, ensuring it covers all possible paths.
- It should keep track of the robot's position and check if it can eventually reach (2, N).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The current implementation only checks a limited set of conditions and does not account for all possible valid paths. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
