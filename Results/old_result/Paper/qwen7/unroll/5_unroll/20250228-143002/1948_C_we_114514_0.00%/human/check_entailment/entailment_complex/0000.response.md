Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input as specified, including the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the directions of the arrows in both rows.
2. The function `func_1` processes each test case according to the rules provided:
   - It checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row by following the arrows.
   - The logic for determining if the robot can reach the second row seems to be flawed. Specifically, the logic for updating `reachable_second_row` is not correctly implemented.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` initially.
   - The loop iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
   - If `reachable_first_row` is `True` and the arrow in the first row points right (`>`), it checks if it is at the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the arrow in the first row points left (`<`), it sets `reachable_first_row` to `False` and checks if the arrow in the second row at the same column points right. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If `reachable_second_row` is `True` and the arrow in the second row points right (`>`), it checks if it is at the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

This logic does not correctly simulate the movement of the robot as described in the problem statement. The robot should move according to the direction of the arrow in the current cell, not just check if the next cell has a right-moving arrow.

A correct approach would involve simulating the robot's movement step-by-step according to the arrows, ensuring it stays within the grid boundaries.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
