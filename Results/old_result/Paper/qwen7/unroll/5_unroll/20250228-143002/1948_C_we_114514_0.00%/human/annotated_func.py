#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, n is even) and two strings, each of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If `reachable_second_row` becomes `True` for a test case, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If 'reachable_second_row' becomes True for a test case, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 2 and 2⋅10^5, inclusive, and even), and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It processes each test case to determine if the second string can be reached from the first string following specific rules. If the second string can be reached, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns the resulting list of 'YES' and 'NO' values.
