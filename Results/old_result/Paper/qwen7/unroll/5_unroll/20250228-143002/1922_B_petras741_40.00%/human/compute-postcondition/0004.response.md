Output State: `buffer` contains a series of integers representing the results of each iteration of the loop, with each result calculated based on the input values of `n` and `w` for each test case. Each result is printed according to the conditions specified within the loop body. If `n < 3`, the output is `0`. Otherwise, the output is calculated using combinations and sums based on the frequency of elements in the list `w`.
