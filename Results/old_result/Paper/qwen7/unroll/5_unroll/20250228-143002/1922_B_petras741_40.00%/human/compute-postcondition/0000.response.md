Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid after the code execution. The other parts of the initial state, particularly related to `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, are not affected by this line of code and thus remain as part of the precondition.
