The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of inputs. Each group contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the frequency of elements in the list `w`. If `n < 3`, the output is `0`. Otherwise, the output is calculated using combinations and sums based on the frequency of elements in the list `w`. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
