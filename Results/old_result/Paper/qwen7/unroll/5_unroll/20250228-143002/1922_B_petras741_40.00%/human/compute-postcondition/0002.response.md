State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `buffer` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `t`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `range(t)` will not produce any values if `t` is 0).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.
4. The variable `buffer` is not directly involved in the loop condition but is mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `t` must be within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)) and `i` should be set to 0.
