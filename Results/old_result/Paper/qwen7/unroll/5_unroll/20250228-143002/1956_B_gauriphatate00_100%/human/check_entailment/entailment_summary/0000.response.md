Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally.
- The provided code only counts how many numbers appear exactly twice in your hand and returns this count as the result. This approach is incorrect because:
  - It does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.
  - It does not simulate the game process where Nene tries to minimize your score while maximizing hers.
  - It assumes that the number of points you can get is simply the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand, which is not true under the optimal play condition.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` only checks for integers that appear exactly twice in the list `a`, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum number of points you can get when playing against an optimal opponent.

Correctness: **False**
