Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `num_tests` is an input integer.
   - The values of `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must satisfy the condition `num_tests > 0`.

4. **Check Current Value of `num_tests`**: Since `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to proceed.

5. **Conclusion**: The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, and it needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure `num_tests` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
