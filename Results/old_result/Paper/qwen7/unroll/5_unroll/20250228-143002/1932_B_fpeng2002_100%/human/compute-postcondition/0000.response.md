Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and the values of `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer input for the number of test cases (`num_tests`). It does not affect the values of `t` or the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n`. Therefore, these values remain as they were in the initial state.
