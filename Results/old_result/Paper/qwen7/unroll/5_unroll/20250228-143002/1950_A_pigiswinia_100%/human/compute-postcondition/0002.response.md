Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for the corresponding set of integers `(a, b, c)` provided as input for each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` is determined by the initial integer input, and for each of the `t` iterations, the output depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` entered during that iteration.
