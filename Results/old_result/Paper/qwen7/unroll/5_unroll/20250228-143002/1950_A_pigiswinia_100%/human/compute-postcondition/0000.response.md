Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and `t` is the input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, after executing the code, `t` will be the integer input provided by the user, which still falls within the range 1 to 1000. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
