Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if the entire first and last rows of the grid are uniform but different from each other, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
