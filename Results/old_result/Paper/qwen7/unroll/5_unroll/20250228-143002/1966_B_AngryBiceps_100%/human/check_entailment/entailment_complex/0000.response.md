Reasoning:
1. The provided solution checks whether the first and last rows of the grid are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'). If they are, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to make all squares the same color.
2. It also checks if the entire first and last rows are uniform but different from each other. If they are, it again prints 'NO'.
3. If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares the same color.
4. However, the logic in the solution is flawed. Specifically, the conditions `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1` and `a[0] != a[-1]` are not sufficient to determine whether it's possible to make all squares the same color. This logic only checks if the first and last rows are uniform and different, which is not a comprehensive check.
5. A more accurate approach would involve checking if there are any two squares of the same color that can be used to perform operations to make the entire grid uniform. The current solution does not cover all possible scenarios where it might be possible to make all squares the same color.

Given the flawed logic in the provided solution, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
