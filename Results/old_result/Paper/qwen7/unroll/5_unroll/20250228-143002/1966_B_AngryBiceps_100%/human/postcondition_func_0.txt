The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n Ã— m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if the entire first and last rows of the grid are uniform but different from each other. If either condition is met, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
