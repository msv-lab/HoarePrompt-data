Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**.

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is converted to an integer, and it remains within the specified range of 1 to 10^3. The other conditions and constraints for `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they have not been involved in the given code snippet.
