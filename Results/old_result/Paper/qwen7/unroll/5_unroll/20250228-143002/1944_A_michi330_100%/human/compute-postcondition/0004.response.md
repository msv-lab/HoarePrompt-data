Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 inclusive. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2. The function returns information based on the values of n and k for each test case within the range constraints.**
