Functionality: **The function reads an integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Based on the values of these integers, it prints one of four possible outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', 'NONE', or 'NONE' again depending on the specific conditions. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
