Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - The program checks if `a == b == c`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NONE'. This is a correct check for the case where all three digits are the same.
   - The program checks if the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`. If this condition is true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - For any other case, it prints 'NONE'.

### Issues with the Program:
- The condition `elif a == b == c:` is redundant because if `a == b == c`, it cannot be a stair or a peak. Therefore, this condition should not be included.
- The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to determine a peak. It only checks if `b` is the maximum value, but it does not ensure that `a < b > c`.

### Correct Conditions:
- To correctly identify a stair, the condition should be `a < b < c`.
- To correctly identify a peak, the condition should be `a < b > c`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues with the conditions used to determine a peak. Based on the analysis, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
