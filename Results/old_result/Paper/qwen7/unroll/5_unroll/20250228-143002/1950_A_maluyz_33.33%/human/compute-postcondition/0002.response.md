Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line, the program reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the input. If \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'. If \(a == b == c\), it prints 'NONE'. If \(b\) is the maximum of the three numbers, it prints 'PEAK'. Otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`.
