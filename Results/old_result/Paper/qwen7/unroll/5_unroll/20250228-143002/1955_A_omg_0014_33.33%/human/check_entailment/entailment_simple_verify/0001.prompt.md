You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either the value of `a * b` or the rounded value of `a * d`, depending on whether `a * b` is less than `a * d`. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `n`. Each line's specific value depends on the input provided for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where:
     - `a` is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.
     - `b` is the price for one yogurt.
     - `c` is the price for two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is supposed to be the price for one yogurt under the promotion.
   - It then compares `a * b` (the cost without promotion) with `a * d` (the cost with promotion).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt under the promotion. However, this calculation assumes that the promotion applies to any number of yogurts, not just pairs.
   - The correct way to use the promotion would be to consider how many pairs of yogurts can be bought and how many individual yogurts remain.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Promotion Usage:**
   - The logic does not correctly account for the best way to use the promotion. It simply compares the total cost without promotion with the total cost with promotion, which may not always yield the minimum cost.

### Correct Approach:

To find the minimum cost, we need to:
1. Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought.
2. Calculate the remaining individual yogurts.
3. Compute the total cost using the promotion for pairs and the regular price for the remaining individual yogurts.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought
        pairs = a // 2
        # Remaining individual yogurts
        remaining = a % 2
        # Total cost using promotion for pairs and regular price for remaining
        total_cost = pairs * c + remaining * b
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical errors in calculating the minimum cost. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
