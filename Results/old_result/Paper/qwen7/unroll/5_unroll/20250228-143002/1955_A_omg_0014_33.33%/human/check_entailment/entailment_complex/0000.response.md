Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Variable Assignment**: Inside the loop, the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned correctly from the input. However, the variable `c` should actually be `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion).

3. **Promotion Price Calculation**: The promotion price per yogurt is calculated as `d = b / 2`. This is correct because the promotion price for two yogurts is `b`, so the price per yogurt under the promotion is `b / 2`.

4. **Comparison and Output**: The program compares `a * b` (price without promotion) with `a * d` (price with promotion). If `a * b` is less, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`. This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required, and the format matches the expected output.

Given these points, the annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

Correctness: **True**
