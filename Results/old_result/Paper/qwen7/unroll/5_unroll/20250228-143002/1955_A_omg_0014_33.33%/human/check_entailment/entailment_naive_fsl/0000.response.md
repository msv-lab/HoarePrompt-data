Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying the yogurts. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where it might be cheaper to buy some yogurts individually and some in pairs. 

For example, in the third test case of the example (3 5 11), the program would incorrectly calculate the cost as 11 (since `c/2` is 5.5, which rounds to 6, and `6*2` is 12). However, the correct approach is to buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5 burles), resulting in a total cost of 15 burles. The program fails to account for this optimal strategy.
