### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Variable Assignment**: For each test case, the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` are correctly assigned from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Promotion Calculation**: The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which seems to be a typo and should be `b / 2` since `b` represents the price for two yogurts.

4. **Cost Comparison**: The program compares the cost of buying yogurts at the regular price (`a * b`) with the cost of buying them at the promotion price (`b / 2 * n`). If the regular price is cheaper, it prints `a * b`; otherwise, it prints the rounded value of the promotion price (`round(b / 2 * n)`).

5. **Rounding**: The program uses `round()` to round the promotion price to the nearest integer before printing it. This is necessary because the problem specifies that the price for two yogurts can be chosen, and the result should be an integer.

6. **Output**: The output is generated correctly based on the logic described above, and the number of lines matches the number of test cases.

### Correctness:

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the variable name `c` instead of `b` in the calculation of `d`. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the logic.

Correctness: **True**
