### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and the annotated code against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description:
- Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
- He can buy two yogurts for \( b \) burles or one yogurt for \( a \) burles.
- The goal is to minimize the total cost.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
- It calculates \( d \) as \( c / 2 \) (though \( c \) is not used in the actual calculations).
- It compares \( a \times b \) with \( a \times d \) and prints the smaller value.

#### Analysis:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The program incorrectly assumes that buying individual yogurts at the regular price \( a \) is always better than buying pairs at the promotion price \( b \).
   - This assumption is flawed because the promotion price \( b \) is for two yogurts, and the program does not consider the possibility of buying some yogurts individually and some in pairs to achieve the minimum cost.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
     - Correct Calculation: Buy both yogurts at the promotion price \( 9 \) burles.
     - Program Output: \( 9 \) (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
     - Correct Calculation: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price \( 9 \) and 1 yogurt at the regular price \( 5 \).
     - Program Output: \( 14 \) (Incorrect, should be \( 15 \))
   - **Test Case 3**: \( n = 3 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
     - Correct Calculation: Buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price \( 11 \) and 1 yogurt at the regular price \( 5 \).
     - Program Output: \( 15 \) (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4**: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)
     - Correct Calculation: Buy all 4 yogurts at the regular price \( 5 \).
     - Program Output: \( 20 \) (Correct)

From the analysis, we see that the program fails to handle the optimal strategy of buying some yogurts individually and some in pairs, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal strategy of buying some yogurts individually and some in pairs to achieve the minimum cost.
