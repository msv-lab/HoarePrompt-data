Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` where:
     - `a` is the number of yogurts Maxim wants to buy.
     - `b` is the price for one yogurt.
     - `c` is the price for two yogurts on promotion.

2. **Calculating the Cost:**
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`, which is supposed to be the price for one yogurt under the promotion.
   - It then compares `a * b` (the cost without promotion) with `a * d` (the cost with promotion).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

### Issues in the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `d`:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt under the promotion. However, this calculation assumes that the promotion applies to any number of yogurts, not just pairs.
   - The correct way to use the promotion would be to consider how many pairs of yogurts can be bought and how many individual yogurts remain.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Promotion Usage:**
   - The logic does not correctly account for the best way to use the promotion. It simply compares the total cost without promotion with the total cost with promotion, which may not always yield the minimum cost.

### Correct Approach:

To find the minimum cost, we need to:
1. Calculate how many pairs of yogurts can be bought.
2. Calculate the remaining individual yogurts.
3. Compute the total cost using the promotion for pairs and the regular price for the remaining individual yogurts.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        # Number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought
        pairs = a // 2
        # Remaining individual yogurts
        remaining = a % 2
        # Total cost using promotion for pairs and regular price for remaining
        total_cost = pairs * c + remaining * b
        print(total_cost)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical errors in calculating the minimum cost. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
