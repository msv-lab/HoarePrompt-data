### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies and stores the positions of goals and players.

2. **Movement and Scoring Logic**:
   - The program correctly updates the position of players based on their movements using the `func_1` function.
   - The logic for scoring is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the corresponding team scores a point, and the Quaffle returns to the center of the field.
   - The program prints the appropriate message when a team scores.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all the moves, the program correctly prints the final score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the movement of players and the throwing of the Quaffle correctly.
   - The scoring mechanism ensures that only the correct team scores when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
   - The program does not handle the case where a player might throw the Quaffle into their own goal, which would result in the opponent scoring a point. However, the problem statement guarantees that such invalid actions are not possible.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function should update the position of the player based on the movement direction, but the current implementation simply returns the new coordinates without updating the player's position in the `players` dictionary. This means that the player's position is not actually updated after each move, leading to incorrect behavior.

For example, consider the following scenario:
- A player is at position (1, 1).
- The player moves right ('R').

The `func_1` function would return (2, 1), but the player's position in the `players` dictionary would still be (1, 1).

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- The `func_1` function is called with `players[mo[0]]` and `mouvements[mo[1]]`, but it does not update the player's position in the `players` dictionary. Instead, it just returns the new coordinates.
- The player's position in the `players` dictionary remains unchanged, leading to incorrect movement tracking.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not correctly update the player's position after each move. This leads to incorrect behavior and potentially incorrect scoring.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
