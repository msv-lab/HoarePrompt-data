#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters describing a row of the field. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG for red goals and BG for blue goals), players (R0-R9 for red players and B0-B9 for blue players), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The number of steps T is an integer where 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and the actions for each step are described as pairs of characters indicating the entity performing the action and the action itself (U, D, L, R for movement, C for catching, T for throwing).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x plus b[0], and y plus b[1]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Parameter `a` is a tuple containing an integer representing the dimension N of the field, and parameter `b` is a tuple containing two integers representing coordinates (x, y) on the field. The function returns new coordinates which are the sum of the original coordinates (x, y) and the values in `b`.
