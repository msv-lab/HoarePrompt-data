Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b. a is an integer representing the dimension N of the field, and b is a list containing two integers representing coordinates (x, y) on the field. The function returns x plus b[0] and y plus b[1].**

This means the function takes an integer `a` and a list `b` which contains two integers. These integers in `b` represent changes to the coordinates `(x, y)` on a field. The function then returns the updated coordinates after adding the values from `b` to the original coordinates `(x, y)`.
