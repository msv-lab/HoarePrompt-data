Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies and stores the positions of goals and players.

2. **Movement and Scoring Logic**:
   - The program correctly updates the position of players based on their movements.
   - The logic for scoring is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the corresponding team scores a point, and the Quaffle returns to the center of the field.
   - The program prints the appropriate message when a team scores.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all the moves, the program correctly prints the final score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the movement of players and the throwing of the Quaffle correctly.
   - The scoring mechanism ensures that only the correct team scores when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
   - The program does not handle the case where a player might throw the Quaffle into their own goal, which would result in the opponent scoring a point. However, the problem statement guarantees that such invalid actions are not possible.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the required functionality correctly based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
