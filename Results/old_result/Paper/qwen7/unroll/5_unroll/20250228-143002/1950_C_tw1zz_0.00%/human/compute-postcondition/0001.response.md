Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the 12-hour format with AM/PM designation, based on the input times provided in the "hh:mm" format. The hours will be adjusted from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, and the minutes will remain unchanged. Each line will follow the format "h1 : m  time", where "h1" is the adjusted hour, "m" is the minute, and "time" is either "AM" or "PM".
