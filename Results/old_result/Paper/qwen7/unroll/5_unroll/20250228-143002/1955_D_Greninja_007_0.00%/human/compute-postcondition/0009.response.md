Postcondition: **`good_subarrays` is incremented by 1 if the number of matches (elements with minimum frequency in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged. `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the sliding window of size `m` over the list `a`, excluding the elements that have been removed when their count reaches zero, `b_freq` remains a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`, `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and `k` remains an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`.**
