Output State: `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the sliding window of size `m` from the list `a` excluding the first `i` elements, `b_freq` is a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in list `b`, `a` is a list of integers with length `n`, `b` is a list of integers with length `m` such that `m <= n`, `k` is an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`, `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` is greater than or equal to `k`.
