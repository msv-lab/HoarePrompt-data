### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that can be rearranged to have at least `k` matching elements with array `b`.
   - The solution uses a sliding window approach to efficiently check each subsegment of `a`.

2. **Key Components**:
   - `Counter` from `collections` is used to count frequencies.
   - A sliding window approach is employed to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of good subsegments.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `good_subarrays` counts the number of good subsegments.
     - `b_freq` stores the frequency of elements in `b`.
     - `window_freq` stores the frequency of elements in the current window of size `m` in `a`.
     - `matches` calculates the initial number of matching elements between the current window and `b`.
   - **Sliding Window**:
     - For each position `i` in the array `a`, the code checks if the current window has at least `k` matches with `b`.
     - If the element leaving the window (`a[i]`) is in `b`, it decreases the `matches` count.
     - If the element entering the window (`a[i+m]`) is in `b`, it increases the `matches` count.
     - The window is updated by removing the element that is sliding out and adding the new element coming into the window.
   - **Edge Case**:
     - After the loop, if the last window also meets the condition, it is counted.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the solution should handle large inputs efficiently.
   - The use of `Counter` ensures that frequency calculations are done in O(1) time for each element, making the overall complexity manageable.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints the number of good subsegments for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**:
  - `a` is a list of integers with length `n`.
  - `b` is a list of integers with length `m` such that `m <= n`.
  - `k` is an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Initialization**:
    - `good_subarrays` is initialized to 0.
    - `b_freq` is a Counter of the frequency of elements in `b`.
    - `window_freq` is a Counter of the frequency of elements in the initial window of `a` of size `m`.
    - `matches` is calculated as the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
  - **Sliding Window**:
    - For each position `i` in the array `a`:
      - If the current window has at least `k` matches, increment `good_subarrays`.
      - Adjust `matches` by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element coming into the window.
      - Update `window_freq` accordingly.
  - **Edge Case**:
    - After the loop, if the last window also meets the condition, it is counted.

- **Final State**:
  - `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the sliding window of size `m` over the list `a`, excluding the elements that have been removed when their count reaches zero.
  - `b_freq` remains a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`.
  - `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively.
  - `k` remains an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`.
  - `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` for which the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` is greater than or equal to `k`.
