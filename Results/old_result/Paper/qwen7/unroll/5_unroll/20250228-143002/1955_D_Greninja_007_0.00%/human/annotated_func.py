    #State: Output State: `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the sliding window of size `m` over the list `a`, excluding the elements that have been removed when their count reaches zero. `b_freq` remains a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`. `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and `k` remains an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`. `good_subarrays` is the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` for which the sum of the minimum frequencies of elements present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1 if the number of matches (elements with minimum frequency in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged. `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the sliding window of size `m` over the list `a`, excluding the elements that have been removed when their count reaches zero, `b_freq` remains a Counter object that counts the frequency of each element in the list `b`, `a` and `b` remain as lists of integers with lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and `k` remains an integer satisfying `1 <= k <= m`.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the value of `good_subarrays`, which is incremented by 1 if the number of matches (elements with minimum frequency in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`) is greater than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `b` (a list of integers), `k` (an integer), and `n` (an integer representing the length of list `a`). It returns the count of subarrays in `a` of length `m` (where `m` is the length of list `b` and `m <= n`) where the number of elements that appear at least as many times in both `a` and `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
