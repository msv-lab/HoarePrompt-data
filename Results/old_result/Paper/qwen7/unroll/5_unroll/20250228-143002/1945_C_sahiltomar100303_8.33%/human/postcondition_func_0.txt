The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the optimal index to split the string such that the difference between the number of zeros and ones on both sides of the split is minimized. If there are multiple optimal indices, it chooses the one closer to the center of the string. The function outputs the chosen index for each test case.
