Output State: The output is determined by the value of `t`. For each `t` from 1 to 2â‹…10^4, the program processes an input string `s` of length `n` and calculates the minimum index `i` such that the first `i` characters and the last `n-i` characters satisfy certain balance conditions regarding the number of zeros and ones. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`.

In more detail, the program checks for the minimum index `i` where the number of zeros and ones on both sides of `i` meet specific criteria. If no valid `i` is found, it prints `-1`. The exact value of `i` depends on the input string `s` and its length `n`.
