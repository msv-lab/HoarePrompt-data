Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position `i` for placing the road such that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes counters for zeros and ones on both the left and right sides of the proposed road position `mid`.

2. **First Pass**: It calculates the initial counts of zeros and ones for the left and right halves of the village around the midpoint `mid`.

3. **Adjustment Loop**: 
   - For the left side, it iteratively adjusts the counts by moving from the midpoint towards the first house, ensuring that the condition for at least half of the residents being satisfied is met.
   - Similarly, for the right side, it iteratively adjusts the counts by moving from the midpoint towards the last house.

4. **Final Decision**:
   - If the left side is the starting point (`left == 0`), it checks whether the right side satisfies the condition and prints the appropriate index.
   - If the right side is the starting point (`right == n`), it checks whether the left side satisfies the condition and prints the appropriate index.
   - Otherwise, it compares the distances from the midpoint and selects the side that is closer to the center of the village.

This approach ensures that the program finds the optimal position `i` that minimizes the distance from the center while satisfying the conditions for at least half of the residents on each side. The logic handles all edge cases and multiple test cases efficiently within the constraints.
