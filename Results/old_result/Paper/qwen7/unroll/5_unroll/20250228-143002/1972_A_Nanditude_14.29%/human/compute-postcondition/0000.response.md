Output State: **The program returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the existing problems, and the second list contains n non-decreasing integers representing the expected difficulties, but both lists are sorted in descending order.**

Explanation: The given code sorts the list `arr` in descending order using `sorted(arr, reverse=True)`. Since `arr` initially consists of two lists, each containing non-decreasing integers, sorting them in descending order will reorder the elements within each list while maintaining their pairing. The resulting output will still consist of two lists, but the integers within each list will be sorted from highest to lowest.
