Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. No other operations are performed, so the binary string `s` remains unchanged, and its length stays within the specified range. The variable `cost` is explicitly set to 0.
