Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed does not account for the exact positions of the cubes after sorting.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- Expected Output: `MAYBE`

However, the program will incorrectly output `YES` because it checks the count of cubes with the same value and the count of cubes with greater values but does not correctly simulate the sorting and removal process.

To illustrate, let's break down the steps:
1. The original list is `[4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`.
2. After sorting, it becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
3. The favorite cube (value 3) is now in the second position.
4. The program checks:
   - `greater_count` (cubes with values greater than 3): 1 (only the 4).
   - `same_value_count` (cubes with the same value as the favorite cube): 3.
5. Since `greater_count` (1) is less than `k` (2), and `greater_count + same_value_count` (1 + 3 = 4) is greater than `k` (2), the program incorrectly prints `MAYBE`.

The correct logic would involve simulating the sorting and checking the exact position of the favorite cube after sorting and removing the first `k` cubes. The current implementation does not accurately reflect this process.
