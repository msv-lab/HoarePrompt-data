Reasoning:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed based on the given conditions. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of cubes `n`, the index of the favorite cube `f`, and the number of removed cubes `k`. It also reads the values of the cubes into a list `a`.

2. **Identifying Favorite Value**: The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube by accessing `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Counting Values Greater Than Favorite Value**: It counts how many cubes have values greater than the favorite value (`greater_count`).

4. **Counting Values Equal to Favorite Value**: It counts how many cubes have the same value as the favorite value (`same_value_count`).

5. **Determining Removal Condition**:
   - If there are at least `k` cubes with values greater than the favorite value, the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`print('YES')`).
   - If the sum of cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite value is less than `k`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed (`print('NO')`).
   - Otherwise, the outcome is uncertain (`print('MAYBE')`).

Given the provided example and the logical steps outlined, the program correctly handles all scenarios as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
