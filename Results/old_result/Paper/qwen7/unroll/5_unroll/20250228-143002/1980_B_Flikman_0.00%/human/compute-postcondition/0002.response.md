Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES', 'NO', and 'MAYBE' based on the conditions evaluated within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the program reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of inputs. Each set includes integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. The program then determines whether there are enough elements in `a` that are either equal to or greater than the `f-th` element of `a`, compared to the value of `k`. If there are at least `k` elements greater than the `f-th` element, it prints 'YES'. If the sum of elements equal to and greater than the `f-th` element is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.
