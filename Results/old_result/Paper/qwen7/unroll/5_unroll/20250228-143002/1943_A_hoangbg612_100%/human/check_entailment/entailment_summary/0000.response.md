Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the game's final score based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
2. Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice tries to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, and Bob tries to minimize it.
3. The provided code does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically:
   - Alice and Bob have different rules for picking elements.
   - Alice can pick any element from the array `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it without appending it to `c`.
4. The code instead focuses on finding the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted array, which does not align with the game's rules.
5. The logic for determining the MEX value based on the optimal play of both players is missing.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the game's rules and logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
