Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, and it incorrectly calculates the MEX of the array `c`.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Turn-Based Logic**: The program does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob. Instead, it sorts the array `N` and then processes it in a way that doesn't reflect the turns taken by the players. Alice should pick elements and append them to `c`, while Bob should only delete elements from `a`.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` by iterating through the sorted array and checking for gaps. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game's rules. The MEX should be calculated after both players have completed their turns, and the program should ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX while Bob minimizes it.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
1
0
```

**Actual Output:**
The provided program does not produce the correct output for these cases. For instance, in the first test case, the program might not correctly simulate the optimal moves for Alice and Bob, leading to an incorrect MEX value.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game's rules and therefore is incorrect.
