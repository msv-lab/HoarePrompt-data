You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        cur = -1
        M = {}
        for num in N:
            if num > cur:
                if num > cur + 1:
                    cur += 1
                    break
                cur = num
                M[cur] = 1
            else:
                M[cur] += 1
        if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:
            cur += 1
        cnt = []
        for k in M.keys():
            if M[k] == 1:
                cnt.append(k)
        if len(cnt) >= 2:
            cur = cnt[1]
        print(cur)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( T \) (number of test cases), an integer \( N \) (length of the array), and an array of \( N \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the array and then identifies the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted array. If no such number exists, it finds the smallest number that appears more than once. The function outputs the identified number for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary since the order of elements in the array doesn't affect the MEX calculation directly. However, sorting might help in some edge cases where the order of operations matters.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`, representing the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Processing Each Number**:
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` to 1.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - If the sum of counts in the dictionary `M` equals the size of the array `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from the dictionary `M` where the count is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in the list `cnt`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. The goal is to simulate the game moves and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game moves.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current logic does not account for these strategies.

3. **Unnecessary Sorting**:
   - Sorting the array `N` is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the solution.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game moves and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c` based on the optimal strategy for both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Alice's turn: pick the smallest available number
        c = []
        for _ in range(S // 2):
            min_num = min(N)
            c.append(min_num)
            N.remove(min_num)

        # Bob's turn: pick the largest available number
        for _ in range(S // 2):
            max_num = max(N)
            N.remove(max_num)

        # Determine the MEX of the resulting array c
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1

        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for simulating the game moves and determining the MEX. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
