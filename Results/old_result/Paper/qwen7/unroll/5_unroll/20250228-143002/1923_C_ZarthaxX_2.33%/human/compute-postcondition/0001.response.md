Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, and `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`. The variables `t` and `q` remain unchanged from their initial states.
