Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q subarray queries defined by pairs of integers l_i and r_i where 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n. For each query, it calculates the sum of elements in the subarray from index l_i to r_i inclusive and returns a list of these sums.**
