Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `c`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, and the array `c` and the list of subarray queries have not been defined yet.**

The code reads two integers `n` and `q` from input, which represent the length of the array `c` and the number of subarray queries, respectively. The values of `t` remain unchanged, and the array `c` and the list of subarray queries are not defined yet.
