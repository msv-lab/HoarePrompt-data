#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.

    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each input string `s`, the output is either the index of the first character from the left or the right that makes the number of zeros or ones on one side less than half of the string length, depending on the specific conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, the function calculates the index of the first character from the left or right that ensures the number of zeros or ones on one side is less than half of the string length. The function then outputs this index. The function iterates through all test cases and prints the result for each one.
