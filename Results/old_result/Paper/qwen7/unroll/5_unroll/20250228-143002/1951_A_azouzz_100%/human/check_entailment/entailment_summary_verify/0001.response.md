Reasoning:

1. **Function `generate_files_for_html_in_range`**:
   - The function is designed to generate `.py` files (specifically `ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found within directories whose names fall within a specified range.
   - It correctly retrieves the current working directory and lists all subdirectories.
   - It iterates over these subdirectories, checks if their names are numeric and fall within the specified range (`start` to `end`), and lists all `.html` files in those directories.
   - It then generates `ac.py` and `wa.py` files for each `.html` file in the directory and prints the paths of the generated files.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is not relevant to the problem description, as the problem does not mention any functionality related to counting '1's in strings or printing 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - The presence of this function does not affect the correctness of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem description specifies that the program should generate `.py` files for each `.html` file in directories with names in a specified range.
   - The provided code correctly implements this logic.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary describes the behavior of `func_1`, which is not part of the main functionality of the program. However, the summary accurately describes what `func_1` does, which is not relevant to the main task.

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is accurate. The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the irrelevant `func_1` function does not affect the main functionality.

Final: **True**
