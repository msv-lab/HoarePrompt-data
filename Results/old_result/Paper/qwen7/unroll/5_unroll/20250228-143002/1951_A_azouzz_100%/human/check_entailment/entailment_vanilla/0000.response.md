### Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two functions: `generate_files_for_html_in_range` and `func_1`. The task is to determine if the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description.

1. **Function `generate_files_for_html_in_range`**:
   - The function is designed to generate `.py` files (specifically `ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found within directories whose names fall within a specified range.
   - It first retrieves the current working directory and lists all subdirectories.
   - It then iterates over these subdirectories, checking if their names are numeric and fall within the specified range (`start` to `end`).
   - For each qualifying directory, it lists all `.html` files and prints how many there are.
   - It then generates `ac.py` and `wa.py` files for each `.html` file in the directory and prints the paths of the generated files.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is not relevant to the problem description, which does not mention any functionality related to counting '1's in strings or printing 'YES' or 'NO'.
   - The presence of this function does not affect the correctness of `generate_files_for_html_in_range`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem description specifies that the program should generate `.py` files for each `.html` file in directories with names in a specified range.
   - The provided code correctly implements this logic.

### Conclusion:

Since the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the irrelevant `func_1` function does not affect the main functionality, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
