Reasoning:
1. The main loop iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the array and attempts to sort it by repeatedly applying the specified operation.
3. The operation involves splitting a number into its constituent digits if the number is at least 10 and inserting those digits back into the array.
4. The `func_1` function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
5. However, the implementation of the operation within the loop is flawed. It only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and applies the operation if true, without ensuring that the entire array is sorted.
6. This approach does not guarantee that the array will be sorted after the operations, as it does not consider the overall order of the array but only the comparison between adjacent elements.
7. The `func_1` function correctly checks if the array is sorted, but the logic to apply the operations to make the array sorted is incorrect.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations.

Correctness: **False**
