Reasoning:
- The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed before determining its correctness.
- The main issue is in the logic of the loop where elements are being manipulated. Specifically, the code attempts to split elements greater than or equal to 10 into their individual digits and reinsert them, but it does not correctly handle the case where multiple operations might be needed to sort the array.
- Additionally, the function `func_1` is only checking if the list is already sorted, not attempting to sort it through the allowed operations.
- The program should attempt to repeatedly apply the operation until the list is sorted or determine that it cannot be sorted.

Given these points, let's analyze the annotated program step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases and reads the necessary inputs.
2. **Sorting Check Function**: The function `func_1` correctly checks if the list is sorted.
3. **Main Logic Issue**: The main loop attempts to sort the list by splitting large numbers, but it does not ensure that the list will eventually be sorted through repeated operations. It also does not handle cases where the list cannot be sorted.

To properly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Apply the operation repeatedly until no more operations can be applied or the list is sorted.
- Ensure that the list is checked after each operation to see if it is sorted.

Given the issues with the provided code, the program is not correctly solving the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
