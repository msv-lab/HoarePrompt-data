### Reasoning

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The main loop iterates through the elements of the array starting from the second element (`p`).
   - It checks if the array is not sorted by calling `func_1`.
   - If the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and the previous element is at least 10, it performs the operation to split the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Checking if the Array is Sorted:**
   - After potentially performing the operation, it checks if the array is sorted by calling `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the original list matches the sorted list, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic in Main Loop:**
   - The main loop should check if the array is already sorted before attempting to modify it. The current logic incorrectly assumes that the array needs modification even if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` is called after every iteration of the main loop, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

2. **Splitting Operation Implementation:**
   - The splitting operation is implemented correctly but is only applied when the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is at least 10.
   - However, the logic to handle the splitting and insertion is not robust enough to ensure the array can be made sorted.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or arrays that cannot be sorted by the given operations.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Attempt to sort the array by splitting elements
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        modified = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            print('No')
            break
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - Before entering the main loop, the program checks if the array is already sorted. If it is, it prints 'Yes' and breaks out of the loop.

2. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop continues to attempt to sort the array by splitting elements until no more splits can be performed or the array is sorted.
   - If a split operation is performed, the `modified` flag is set to `True`.
   - If no split operation is performed in a full iteration of the loop, the array cannot be sorted, and the program prints 'No'.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is no longer needed since the sorting check is done directly.

### Conclusion

The original program has logical issues and inefficiencies. The corrected program ensures that the array is checked for being sorted before attempting modifications and handles the splitting operation correctly.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
