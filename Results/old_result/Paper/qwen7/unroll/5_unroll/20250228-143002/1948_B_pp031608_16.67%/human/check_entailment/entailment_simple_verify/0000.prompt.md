You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in ascending order or not.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the splitting of elements that are at least 10 properly. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Element Splitting**: The program attempts to split elements greater than or equal to 10 but does so in a way that doesn’t align with the problem description. The logic inside the loop where the program tries to split elements is flawed. It checks if `func_1(list1)` returns `False` and then splits the element, but this approach is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.

2. **Incomplete Logic for Splitting**: The function `func_1` is used to check if the array is sorted, but it does not help in determining how to split elements to achieve the desired sorted order. The program should focus on ensuring that after each split, the array can be checked for sorted order more effectively.

3. **Potential Case Where the Program Fails**: Consider the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The program should be able to split `45` into `[4, 5]` and `67` into `[6, 7]`, resulting in `[12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly because it only checks if the array is sorted after a single attempt to split an element, rather than repeatedly attempting splits until the array is sorted.

To fix the program, you would need to implement a loop that continues to split elements until the array is sorted or determine that it is impossible to sort the array through the described operations. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    def can_sort_array(arr):
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                return False
        return True

    def split_elements(arr):
        new_arr = []
        for num in arr:
            if num >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
                new_arr.extend(digits)
            else:
                new_arr.append(num)
        return new_arr

    while not can_sort_array(list1):
        list1 = split_elements(list1)

    if can_sort_array(list1):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is repeatedly split until it is sorted or determines that sorting is impossible.
