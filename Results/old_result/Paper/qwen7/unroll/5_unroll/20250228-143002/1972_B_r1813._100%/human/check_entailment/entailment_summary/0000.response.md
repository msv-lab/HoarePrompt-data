Reasoning:
The given program reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes each one according to the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It then iterates over each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n` and `s`) and counting the number of 'U' characters in `s`.
3. If the count of 'U' characters is odd, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic aligns with the problem statement, which states that Alice wins if the number of facing-up coins ('U') is odd before her turn. The program correctly counts the number of 'U' characters and makes the decision based on this count.

Given the execution summary, the program processes each test case correctly and prints the appropriate output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
