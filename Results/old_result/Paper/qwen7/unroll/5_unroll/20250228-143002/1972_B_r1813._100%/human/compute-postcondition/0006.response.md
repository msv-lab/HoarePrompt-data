Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes variables t, n, and s where t is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". For each test case defined by t, the function returns the count of "U" in the string s.**
