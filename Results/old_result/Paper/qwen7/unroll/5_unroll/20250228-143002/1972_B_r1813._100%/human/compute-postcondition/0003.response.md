Output State: **`t` is the first element of the list `data` converted to an integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `index` is 1.**

Explanation: The line `index = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial states.
