Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Sorting Key**: The sorting key should consider both the balance and the position in reverse order when the balances are equal. However, the current implementation sorts in increasing order of balance and then by negative position, which means it incorrectly handles ties.

2. **Table Construction**: The program constructs a dictionary `d` to store the balance at each index but does not include the positions in the dictionary. Instead, it should create a list of tuples containing the balance and position.

3. **Final Shuffle**: After sorting, the program constructs the shuffled sequence by directly using the indices from the sorted dictionary, which is incorrect because the indices in the sorted dictionary do not necessarily correspond to the original sequence's structure.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, i))
    
    # Sort by balance (ascending) and position (descending)
    positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    
    ans = ''
    for _, pos in positions:
        ans += s[pos]
    
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

This corrected version correctly constructs the balance and position pairs, sorts them as required, and then reconstructs the shuffled sequence.
