Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n`, and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. Specifically, if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it adds `a[i]` to the template. If they differ, it adds the uppercase version of `a[i]` to the template.
4. It then checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template. This is done by iterating through each character and ensuring that if the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match it. If the template character is uppercase, neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match its lowercase version.
5. It also checks if `c` does not match the template. This is done similarly, but with `c` instead of `a` and `b`.
6. If the conditions for both `a` and `b` matching the template and `c` not matching are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected results based on the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
