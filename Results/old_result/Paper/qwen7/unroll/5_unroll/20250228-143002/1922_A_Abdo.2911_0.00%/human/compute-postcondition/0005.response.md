Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of strings), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (each of length \( n \) consisting of lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison between \( a \) and \( b \), then checks if \( a \) and \( b \) match according to the template and if \( c \) does not match the template. If \( a \) and \( b \) match the template but \( c \) does not, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on these conditions for each test case.**
