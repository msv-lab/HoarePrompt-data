You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa
    
    10
    
    mathforces
    
    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each iteration, if the conditions `match_a_b` and `not match_c` are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of strings), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (each of length \( n \) consisting of lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison between \( a \) and \( b \), then checks if \( a \) and \( b \) match according to the template and if \( c \) does not match the template. If \( a \) and \( b \) match the template but \( c \) does not, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on these conditions for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not due to the presence of uppercase letters in the template.

Consider the following test case:

```
4
2
aa
bb
aa
```

- For the first character, both `a` and `b` are `a`, so the template should be `"a"`.
- For the second character, both `a` and `b` are `a`, so the template should also be `"a"`.

However, the program incorrectly appends `a.upper()` to the template when `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match, which would result in the template being `"AA"` in this case. This means that `c` will not match the template because it has lowercase letters, even though `a` and `b` do match the template.

To fix this, the program should only append `a[i]` to the template when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the template is constructed correctly based on the characters in `a` and `b`, and it properly checks if `c` matches the template.
