### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**:
   - The program constructs a template based on the characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends `a[i]` to the template. Otherwise, it appends `a[i].upper()` to the template.
   
2. **Matching Conditions**:
   - It checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, it must exactly match the corresponding character in `a` or `b`.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, it must not match the corresponding character in `a` or `b` (i.e., it should be different when converted to lowercase).
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
     - If the character in the template is lowercase, it must not match the corresponding character in `c`.
     - If the character in the template is uppercase, it must match the corresponding character in `c` (i.e., it should be the same when converted to lowercase).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where `a` and `b` have different characters at some positions, ensuring that the template is constructed appropriately.
   - The logic for checking if `a` and `b` match the template and if `c` does not match the template is sound.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
