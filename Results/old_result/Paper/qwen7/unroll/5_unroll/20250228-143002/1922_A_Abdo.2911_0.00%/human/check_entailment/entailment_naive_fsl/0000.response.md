Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where both `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not due to the presence of uppercase letters in the template.

Consider the following test case:

```
4
2
aa
bb
aa
```

- For the first character, both `a` and `b` are `a`, so the template should be `"a"`.
- For the second character, both `a` and `b` are `a`, so the template should also be `"a"`.

However, the program incorrectly appends `a.upper()` to the template when `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match, which would result in the template being `"AA"` in this case. This means that `c` will not match the template because it has lowercase letters, even though `a` and `b` do match the template.

To fix this, the program should only append `a[i]` to the template when `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the template is constructed correctly based on the characters in `a` and `b`, and it properly checks if `c` matches the template.
