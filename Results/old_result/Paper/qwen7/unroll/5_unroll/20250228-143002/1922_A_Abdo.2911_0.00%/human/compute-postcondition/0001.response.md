State: **`t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, _ is not a variable that needs adjustment as it is a placeholder**.

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python for iterating over a sequence without needing to reference the actual value. It does not hold any state that needs to be adjusted.
- The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). If `t` is outside this range, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
