Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each value of t, there are multiple values of res, where res is calculated based on the input values of n and nums. Each res is computed according to the rules within the loop body. After all iterations, the final state of t remains unchanged, but the values of res for each iteration are determined by the input data.
