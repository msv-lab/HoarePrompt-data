The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates and sums up specific combinations based on the frequency of numbers in the list `a`. The final output is the cumulative sum of these combinations for all test cases.
