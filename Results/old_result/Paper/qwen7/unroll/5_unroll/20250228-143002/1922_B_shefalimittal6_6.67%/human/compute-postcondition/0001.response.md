Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is defined as `int(input())`, it is given that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Given that `t` is a positive integer, it means `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
