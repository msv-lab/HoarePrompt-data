Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, input is taken for each test case, A and B are yet to be calculated based on the given formula, and their sum is yet to be printed for each test case.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) are maintained, and now `t` holds the value of the input integer. The values for `a`, `b`, and `m` are yet to be provided, and thus `A` and `B` are not yet calculated.
