You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each iteration based on whether the sum of the first two integers in each input string is even or odd. Specifically, if the sum is even, 'Bob' will be printed; otherwise, 'Alice' will be printed. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input provided for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input**:
   - The program splits the string `s` using `split()` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`, respectively.

3. **Winning Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Correctness Analysis

To determine if the program is correct, we need to understand the optimal strategy for the game and how the condition `(a + b) % 2 == 0` relates to the outcome.

#### Optimal Strategy
- Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
- Removing one coin from the current wallet is always possible as long as the wallet is not empty.
- The key insight is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner:
  - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force Alice into a losing position.
  - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position.

#### Reasoning
- When `a + b` is even:
  - Bob can always ensure that after his move, the total number of coins remains even.
  - This means Alice will eventually be forced to make a move when the total is 0, making her lose.
- When `a + b` is odd:
  - Alice can always ensure that after her move, the total number of coins becomes even.
  - This means Bob will eventually be forced to make a move when the total is 0, making him lose.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the winning condition based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion
The program correctly determines the winner based on the given rules and logic. Therefore, the program is correct.
