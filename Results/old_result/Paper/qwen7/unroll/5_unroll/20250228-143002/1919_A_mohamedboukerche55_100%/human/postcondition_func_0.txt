The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` followed by `t` pairs of positive integers `a` and `b`. For each pair, it checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'; if the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
