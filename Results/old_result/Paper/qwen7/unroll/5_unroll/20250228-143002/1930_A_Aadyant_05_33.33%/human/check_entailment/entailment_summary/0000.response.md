Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` but does not handle it properly. It should process each test case individually, but the current implementation processes all test cases in a loop without separating them.
2. **Sorting and Selection**: The program sorts the list of integers and then selects every second element. However, the problem requires selecting two integers at a time and adding the minimum of the two to the score. The current approach only considers every second element, which is incorrect.
3. **Repetition**: The program prints the sum of every second element for each test case, repeated `t` times. This is unnecessary and incorrect because the score should be calculated for each test case once, not repeatedly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
