Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input string, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `out` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `out`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `num`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
