Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num`) but then incorrectly processes each test case as if `num` were the number of integers to process. This leads to reading the wrong number of integers for each test case.

2. **Sorting and Picking Minimums**: The program sorts the list of integers but then only picks every other element starting from the first index. This approach does not guarantee the optimal solution because it doesn't always pick the smallest available pair.

3. **Incorrect Looping Logic**: The loop that processes each test case should handle pairs of integers correctly. Instead, the current logic is flawed and does not ensure that the minimum values are always picked optimally.

4. **Redundant List Clearing**: The lines `del list1[:]` and `del list2[:]` are redundant since the lists are reinitialized in the next iteration anyway.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = sorted([int(x) for x in data[index:index + 2 * n]])
        index += 2 * n
        
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Reads all inputs at once and splits them into a list.
- Processes each test case correctly by sorting the numbers and summing up the minimum pairs.
- Ensures the optimal score is calculated by always picking the smallest available pair.
