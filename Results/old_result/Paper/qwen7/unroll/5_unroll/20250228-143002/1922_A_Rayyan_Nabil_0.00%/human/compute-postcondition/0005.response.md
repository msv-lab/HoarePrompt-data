Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value or message based on the given inputs.**

Note: The actual determination or return value based on the inputs (a, b, c) is not specified in the provided information, so the functionality description focuses on the structure and input nature of the function.
