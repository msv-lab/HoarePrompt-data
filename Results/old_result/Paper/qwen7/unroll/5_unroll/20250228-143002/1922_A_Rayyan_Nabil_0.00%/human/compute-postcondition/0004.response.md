Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is determined based on the comparison of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each index within the range of `n`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

In this output state, the variable `l` will be set to 'NO' if for any value of `i` in the range of `n`, the characters at the same index in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` will be set to 'YES'.
