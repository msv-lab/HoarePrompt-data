Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The program checks if for every character position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is not sufficient to determine if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
3. Instead, the program should check if there is at least one position where `a[i]` matches `c[i]` and `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, and at least one position where `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
4. The current implementation will incorrectly return 'YES' for some cases where the actual answer should be 'NO'.

Correctness: **False**

The program needs to be modified to correctly check for the existence of a template that satisfies the conditions for matching `a` and `b` but not `c`.
