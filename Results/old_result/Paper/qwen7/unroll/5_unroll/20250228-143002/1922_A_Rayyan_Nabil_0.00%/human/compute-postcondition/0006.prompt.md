You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is determined based on the comparison of strings `a`, `b`, and `c` for each index within the range of `n`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
    #
    #In this output state, the variable `l` will be set to 'NO' if for any value of `i` in the range of `n`, the characters at the same index in strings `a`, `b`, and `c` do not satisfy the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` will be set to 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific value or message based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
