Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Template Matching Logic**: The current implementation checks if for every character position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is not sufficient to determine if there exists a valid template. Instead, we need to find a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

2. **Template Construction**: The program should construct a template character by character based on the comparison between `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and neither matches `c[i]`, then the template character at position `i` can be set to the character from `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then no template can satisfy both `a` and `b`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if a[i].islower() and c[i].isupper() or a[i].isupper() and c[i].islower():
                    # If a[i] and b[i] are the same and do not match c[i], append a[i]
                    template.append(a[i])
                elif a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                    # If a[i] and b[i] are the same and do not match c[i], append a[i]
                    template.append(a[i])
                else:
                    # If a[i] and b[i] are the same and match c[i], template cannot exist
                    print("NO")
                    break
            else:
                # If a[i] and b[i] are different, no template can satisfy both
                print("NO")
                break
        else:
            # If the loop completes without breaking, check if c does not match the template
            if any(c[i] == t.lower() for i, t in enumerate(template)):
                print("NO")
            else:
                print("YES")

func()
```

This corrected version constructs the template character by character and ensures that the conditions for matching `a` and `b` while not matching `c` are met.
