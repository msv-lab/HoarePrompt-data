### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` which contains the best friend index for each friend.
   - It then uses a while loop to check pairs of consecutive elements in the list `l`.
   - If it finds a pair where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Issues with the Given Code**:
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is incorrect. This condition checks for specific values that do not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The code only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider all possible configurations of the best friend relationships.
   - The code does not handle cycles properly and does not ensure that at least 2 friends are invited.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this correctly, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships and ensure that we cover at least one complete cycle or part of it to invite enough friends.
   - We should use a more comprehensive approach to detect cycles and ensure that we minimize the number of invitations.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary states that the function checks for a specific pattern (`p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`) and prints `2` if found, otherwise prints `3`.
   - This summary is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual logic of the function, which only checks for a specific pattern and does not handle the problem as described.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the given code does not solve the problem correctly.
   - The function summary also incorrectly describes the function's behavior, which further supports the conclusion that the code is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly solve the problem, and the function summary is also incorrect. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**
