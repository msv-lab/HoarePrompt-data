Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct; the loop iterates through each test case, checks for the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` in the list `l`, and prints 2 if the condition is met for any i, otherwise prints 3.
