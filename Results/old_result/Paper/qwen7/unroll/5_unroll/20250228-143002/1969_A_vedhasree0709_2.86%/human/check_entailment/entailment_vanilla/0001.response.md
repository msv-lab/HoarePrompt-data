### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` which contains the best friend index for each friend.
   - It then uses a while loop to check pairs of consecutive elements in the list `l`.
   - If it finds a pair where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Issues with the Given Code**:
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is incorrect. This condition checks for specific values that do not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The code only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider all possible configurations of the best friend relationships.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this correctly, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships and ensure that we cover at least one complete cycle or part of it to invite enough friends.
   - We should use a more comprehensive approach to detect cycles and ensure that we minimize the number of invitations.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
