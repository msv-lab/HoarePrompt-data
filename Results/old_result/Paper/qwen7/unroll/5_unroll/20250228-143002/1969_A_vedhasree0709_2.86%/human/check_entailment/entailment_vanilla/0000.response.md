### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by the array `p`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes input for the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.
   - It uses a while loop to check pairs of friends `(i, i+1)` to see if they can be invited together (`l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic checks only pairs of consecutive friends and does not consider all possible pairs or cycles in the best friend relationships.
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is too restrictive and does not cover all scenarios where inviting a pair of friends could satisfy the condition.
   - The program fails to handle cases where multiple cycles exist and needs to find the minimum number of invitations covering at least 2 friends.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `4` with `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. The program would incorrectly output `3` because it does not find the pair `(1, 2)` which can be invited together, even though inviting friends `1` and `3` would also work.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. It fails to handle various scenarios and does not guarantee the optimal solution.

**Correctness: False**
