You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `p` of `n` integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index `i` in the list `p` such that `p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend will come if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` which contains the best friend index for each friend.
   - It then uses a while loop to check pairs of consecutive elements in the list `l`.
   - If it finds a pair where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Issues with the Given Code**:
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is incorrect. This condition checks for specific values that do not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party.
   - The logic to find the minimum number of invitations is flawed. The code only checks for a specific pattern and does not consider all possible configurations of the best friend relationships.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this correctly, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships and ensure that we cover at least one complete cycle or part of it to invite enough friends.
   - We should use a more comprehensive approach to detect cycles and ensure that we minimize the number of invitations.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
