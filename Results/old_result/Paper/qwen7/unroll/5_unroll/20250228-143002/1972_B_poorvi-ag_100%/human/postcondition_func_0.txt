The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and strings `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It checks if the count of "U" in each string `s` is odd or even and appends "yes" or "no" to the `results` list accordingly. Finally, it prints each element in the `results` list on a new line.
