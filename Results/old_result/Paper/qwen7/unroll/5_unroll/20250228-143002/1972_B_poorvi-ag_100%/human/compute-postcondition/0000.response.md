Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial value of `t` was a positive integer between 1 and 100, and now it is explicitly set to the integer input. The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
