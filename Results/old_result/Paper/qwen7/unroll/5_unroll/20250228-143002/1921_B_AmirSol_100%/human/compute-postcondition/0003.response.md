Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), s1 (a string of length n consisting of '0' and '1'), and s2 (a string of length n consisting of '0' and '1'). It returns the maximum value between the number of positions where s1[i] is '0' and s2[i] is '1', and the number of positions where s1[i] is '1' and s2[i] is '0' for i in the range of n.**
