Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to reduce the frequency of each number in the array to at most `k`. However, this function does not actually help in determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards**: The logic to determine the minimum number of cards should focus on the frequency distribution of the numbers on the cards. Specifically, we need to check how many groups of `k` identical cards exist and how many cards are left over after performing the operations optimally.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Frequencies**: The `func_1` function reduces frequencies but doesn't provide the necessary information to calculate the minimum number of remaining cards. Instead, we need to count how many full sets of `k` cards we can form and then account for the remainder.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Count the frequency of each number.
2. Determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after forming these full sets.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards_left += count % k
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

This approach correctly counts the frequency of each number and calculates the minimum number of cards left after performing the allowed operations.
