Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in arr:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `num` is a variable that will take on each value from the list `arr` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary and is not involved in the loop head.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `arr`. Once `arr` is exhausted (i.e., `arr` becomes empty), the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` is a variable that will take on each value from `arr`, we don't need to adjust its initial state directly.
   - We need to ensure that `arr` is not empty for the loop to start executing. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `arr` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element, frequency_table is an empty dictionary**
