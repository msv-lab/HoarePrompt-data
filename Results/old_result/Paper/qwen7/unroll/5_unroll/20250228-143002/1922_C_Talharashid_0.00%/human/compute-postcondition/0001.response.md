Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t` (which is used as the upper bound for the range function).

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0, as `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate no values if `t` is 0.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute. Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, we can set `t` to any value within this range to ensure the loop executes.

5. **Final State**: The initial state of `t` should be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. Since `t` is derived from user input, we can assume it will be set to a valid value within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be at least 1.

**State:**
**`t` must be at least 1**
