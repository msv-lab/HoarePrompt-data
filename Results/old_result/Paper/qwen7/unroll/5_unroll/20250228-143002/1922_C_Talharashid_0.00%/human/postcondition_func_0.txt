The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it calculates the sum of absolute differences between adjacent elements in the list from both left and right directions. It then responds to each query by providing the minimum value between the sums calculated from the left and right sides for the specified subarray. The function outputs the results for all queries in the form of integers, one per line.
