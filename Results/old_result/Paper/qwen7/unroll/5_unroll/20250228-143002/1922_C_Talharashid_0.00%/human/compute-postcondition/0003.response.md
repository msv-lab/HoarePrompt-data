Output State: **The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing an integer result from the given code snippet. For each iteration `i` (where `0 <= i < t`), the result is calculated based on the input list `lst` and the number of queries `m`. The result for each query is the minimum value of `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is the sum of differences calculated from the left side of the list and `s2` is the sum of differences calculated from the right side of the list, for the specified subarray defined by `start` and `end`.**

This output state describes the final results printed by the code after all iterations of the loop have completed, with each line representing the result of one of the `m` queries for each of the `t` test cases.
