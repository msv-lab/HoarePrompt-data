Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move either adds or removes one cube.
- The solution logic checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
- This logic is correct because:
  - To end up with `m` cubes, the net number of additions must be `m`.
  - Since each move adds or removes exactly one cube, the total number of additions minus the total number of removals must equal `m`.
  - The total number of moves `n` is the sum of additions and removals.
  - Therefore, `n - m` must be even because every addition or removal pair cancels out, leaving an even difference if the final count is `m`.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
