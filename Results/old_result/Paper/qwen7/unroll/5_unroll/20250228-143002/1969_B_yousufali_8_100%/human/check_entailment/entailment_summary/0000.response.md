Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided code consists of two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function calculates the total cost to sort a single binary string using cyclic shifts. It correctly identifies segments of '1's and '0's and calculates the cost based on the length of these segments.
   - `func_2()`: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the binary string and calls `func_1()` to calculate and print the result.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the functions seem to be designed to solve the problem correctly. `func_1()` accurately computes the cost for sorting a single binary string, and `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()`.

Therefore, the given program appears to be correct based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
