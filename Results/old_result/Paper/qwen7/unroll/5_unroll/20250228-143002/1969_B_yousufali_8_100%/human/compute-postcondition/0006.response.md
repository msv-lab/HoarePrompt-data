Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Binary String `s`:**
   - `s` is a binary string, but its exact content is not specified. For the purpose of determining the output, we need to consider how the `ans` variable is calculated.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is explicitly stated to be 0.

3. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is defined as the sum of all substrings starting from a '1' and ending just before a '0'.
   - To understand this, let's consider the definition:
     - If there are no '1's followed by '0's in the string, `ans` would be 0.
     - If there are such substrings, `ans` would be the sum of their lengths.

Given the definition of `ans`, let's analyze the possible scenarios:

- If `s` does not contain any '1' followed by '0', then `ans` will be 0.
- If `s` contains substrings like "10", "1010", etc., `ans` will be the sum of the lengths of these substrings.

Since the exact content of `s` is not provided, we can only express `ans` in terms of the binary string `s`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of all substrings starting from a '1' and ending just before a '0' in the binary string s)**
