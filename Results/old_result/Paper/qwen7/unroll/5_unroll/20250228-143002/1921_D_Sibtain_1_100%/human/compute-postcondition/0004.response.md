Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two lists of integers, `a` and `c`. If both lists contain identical unique elements, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. It then iterates through the elements of both lists, calculating the maximum absolute difference between corresponding elements from the two lists, and accumulates these differences. Finally, it prints the total accumulated value for each test case.**
