Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the result of the loop's execution for each test case. Each integer represents the calculated value of `ans` for that specific test case based on the given conditions and operations within the loop. The values of `ans` are determined by sorting lists `a` and `c`, comparing elements from opposite ends of these sorted lists, and summing up the maximum absolute differences until all elements are processed.
