Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The problem requires splitting the array `a` (represented by the string `s`) into non-empty subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
2. The penalty calculation involves the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.
3. The program simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` and outputs their difference (`P - M`). This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

Given the example inputs and expected outputs, the program fails to account for the optimal splitting strategy. For instance, in the third test case with input `"--+++++++-"`, the program would output `0` because it counts the number of '+' and '-' characters, but the optimal solution involves splitting the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
