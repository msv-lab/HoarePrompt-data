Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s` for each test case and prints this difference. However, the problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is incorrect:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The program calculates `P - M`, which is simply the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`. This does not account for the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the penalty.
2. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program does not attempt to split the array `a` in a way that minimizes the total penalty.
3. **Optimal Splitting**: The problem requires an optimal splitting strategy, but the program does not implement any logic to achieve this. It only counts the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Given these points, the program does not solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
