Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variables involved here are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop depends on the value of `int(input())`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1.
   - The variable `t` is already within the required range, so no adjustment is needed for `t`.
   - The variable `s` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so no adjustment is needed for `s`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `int(input())` is at least 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, int(input()) must be at least 1**
