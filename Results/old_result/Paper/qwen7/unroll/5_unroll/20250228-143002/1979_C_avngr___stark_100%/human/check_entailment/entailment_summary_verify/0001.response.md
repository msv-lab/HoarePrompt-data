### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\) which determines the payout if that outcome wins.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - `func_2` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

3. **Applying the Functions to the Problem**:
   - The LCM of the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\) gives the smallest number that is a multiple of all \(k_i\). This value represents the minimum amount that needs to be bet across all outcomes to ensure that the total bet is less than the payout for any winning outcome.
   - If the LCM of the multipliers is greater than 1, we can distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM. We can achieve this by setting each \(x_i\) (bet on outcome \(i\)) to 1, because the LCM of the multipliers ensures that the total bet will be less than the payout for any winning outcome.
   - If the LCM of the multipliers is 1, it means that the multipliers do not share any common factors other than 1, and the smallest possible total bet would be 1. However, since the multipliers are at least 2, the LCM cannot be 1.

4. **Checking the Conditions**:
   - The code correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - If the LCM is greater than 1, the code returns a list of 1s, indicating that betting 1 coin on each outcome satisfies the condition.
   - If the LCM is 1, the code returns -1, indicating that no valid distribution exists.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to find the LCM of the multipliers and determine if a valid distribution of coins exists.
   - The code handles all test cases as per the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the analysis. The code accurately determines whether a valid distribution of coins exists and provides the appropriate output according to the problem requirements.
