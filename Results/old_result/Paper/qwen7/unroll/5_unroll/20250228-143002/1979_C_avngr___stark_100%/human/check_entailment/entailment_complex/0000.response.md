Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The solution involves calculating a common value `m` using the `func_2` function, which computes the product of all multipliers after reducing each pair with the greatest common divisor (GCD). This ensures that the resulting value `m` is the smallest possible value that can be evenly divided by all multipliers.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Computes the absolute value of the product of two integers divided by their GCD. Given the constraints (2 <= a, b <= 20), this function correctly reduces the product to its simplest form.
   - **func_2**: Iteratively applies `func_1` to compute the product of all multipliers in the list. This ensures that the final value `m` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers, adjusted by their GCDs.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop processes each test case, computing `m` using `func_2`.
   - For each outcome, it calculates the bet amount `c[i]` as `m // k[i]`.
   - It checks if the sum of all bets is less than or equal to `m`. If so, it prints `-1` because the bets do not satisfy the condition. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies when the bets do not satisfy the condition (sum of bets >= `m`) and outputs `-1`.
   - The bets calculated as `m // k[i]` ensure that the total bet is less than `m` for any winning outcome, as required.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
