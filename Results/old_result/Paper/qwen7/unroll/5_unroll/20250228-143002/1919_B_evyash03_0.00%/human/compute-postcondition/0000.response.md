Output State: **`count` is 0, expression is a string consisting of characters "+" and "-", and length is an integer representing the length of the string expression such that 1 <= length <= 5000.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `count` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables or the string `expression`. Therefore, the length of the string `expression` and its composition remain unchanged, and `count` is set to 0.
