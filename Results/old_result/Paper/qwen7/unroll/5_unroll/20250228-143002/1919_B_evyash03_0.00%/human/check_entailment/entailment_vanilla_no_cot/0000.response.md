Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not designed to compute the penalty as defined in the problem. Instead, it counts the number of segments where the balance goes negative, which is not relevant to the penalty calculation.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to split the array into segments such that the penalty is minimized. The penalty for a segment is the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to minimize the total penalty.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    
    # Convert the string to an array of 1s and -1s
    arr = [1 if char == '+' else -1 for char in expression]
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum penalty
    min_penalty = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0
    current_length = 0
    
    # Iterate through the array to find the minimum penalty
    for i in range(length):
        current_sum += arr[i]
        current_length += 1
        
        # If the current segment's sum is zero, it has no penalty
        if current_sum == 0:
            min_penalty = min(min_penalty, current_length)
            current_sum = 0
            current_length = 0
        
        # If the current segment's sum is non-zero, calculate the penalty
        if current_sum != 0:
            penalty = abs(current_sum) * current_length
            min_penalty = min(min_penalty, penalty)
    
    # If the last segment is not zero, add its penalty
    if current_sum != 0:
        penalty = abs(current_sum) * current_length
        min_penalty = min(min_penalty, penalty)
    
    print(min_penalty)
```

This corrected program dynamically calculates the minimum penalty by iterating through the array and keeping track of the current segment's sum and length. It updates the minimum penalty whenever a segment with a sum of zero is found or when a segment with a non-zero sum is processed.
