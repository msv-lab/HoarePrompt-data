Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. For each test case, it correctly initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, and adjusts these positions according to the rules of the game.
3. The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha (`bm` and `sm`) by considering the maximum possible score at each step, which includes staying at the current position or moving to the new position indicated by the permutation.
4. The logic for updating the scores and positions seems to follow the rules of the game accurately.
5. The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner is correctly implemented.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to be following the correct logic and handling all aspects of the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
