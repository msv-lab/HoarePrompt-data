Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initially set to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This is because the maximum score for a player after `k` turns is achieved by moving to the best possible position each turn.

4. **Simulating Game Turns:**
   - The program enters a loop that simulates the game turns.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha to their next positions using the permutation `p`.
   - It then updates the scores `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score plus the new position value or the previous maximum score.
   - The loop breaks when `k` turns are completed.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Check

The logic in the program seems to follow the rules of the game correctly. However, there is a potential issue with the way the maximum scores are updated. Specifically, the program should ensure that the maximum scores are updated correctly for each turn, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the logic with a few examples:

#### Example 1:
- Testcase: `4 2 3 2`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 3, Sasha at 2.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 3 → Score = 5, Moves to 3.
  - Sasha at 2 → Score = 2, Moves to 1.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 3 → Score = 10, Moves to 3.
  - Sasha at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 2.
- Final scores: Bodya = 10, Sasha = 9. Bodya wins.

#### Example 2:
- Testcase: `4 2 2 3`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 2, Sasha at 3.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 2 → Score = 2, Moves to 1.
  - Sasha at 3 → Score = 6, Moves to 2.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 4.
  - Sasha at 2 → Score = 7, Moves to 1.
- Final scores: Bodya = 7, Sasha = 7. Draw.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to be correct. The logic follows the rules of the game and handles the simulation of the game turns accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
