Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is now explicitly set to the integer input provided by the user. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) remain in their initial unspecified state.
