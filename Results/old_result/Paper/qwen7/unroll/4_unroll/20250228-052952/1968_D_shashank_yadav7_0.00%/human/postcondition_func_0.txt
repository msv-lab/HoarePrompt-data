The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and two indices \( P_B \) and \( P_S \), along with a permutation \( p \) and an array \( a \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates two values, \( bm \) and \( sm \), based on the elements of \( a \) and the indices \( P_B \) and \( P_S \) under certain transformations. After processing all test cases, it prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' for each test case depending on the comparison between \( bm \) and \( sm \).
