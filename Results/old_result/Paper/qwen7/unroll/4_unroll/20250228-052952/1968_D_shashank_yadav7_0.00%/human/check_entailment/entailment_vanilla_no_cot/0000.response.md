Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Position and Score Initialization**: It initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, and calculates their initial scores based on the starting positions.
3. **Game Loop**: The program simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores of both players. It uses the maximum possible score for each player at each turn, considering the option to stay or move to the new position.
4. **Winner Determination**: After simulating the game, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

The logic used in the program accurately reflects the rules of the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
