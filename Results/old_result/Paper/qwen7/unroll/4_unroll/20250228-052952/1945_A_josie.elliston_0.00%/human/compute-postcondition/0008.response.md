Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It checks if `extroverts` modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and if `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is greater than or equal to 3. If these conditions are met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3. Otherwise, it returns None.**
