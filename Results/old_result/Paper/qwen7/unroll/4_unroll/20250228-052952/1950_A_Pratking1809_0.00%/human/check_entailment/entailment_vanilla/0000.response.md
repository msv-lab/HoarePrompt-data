### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100, but it is not used in the logic, which is fine since it's not required for the problem.
3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The loop iterates `q` times, processing each test case.
4. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
5. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases where the conditions do not match (e.g., `a >= b` or `b <= c`).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic for determining whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither, and it processes each test case independently, the program is correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
