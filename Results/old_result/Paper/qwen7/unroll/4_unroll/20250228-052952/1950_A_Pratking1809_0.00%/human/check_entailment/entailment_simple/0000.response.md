### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Test Cases**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is also correct.

3. **Stair Condition Check**: The condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented.

4. **Peak Condition Check**: The condition `if a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak. However, this condition should be `if a < b and b > c:` to ensure both conditions are met. The current implementation without the `and` operator can lead to incorrect results if `b` is not strictly greater than `c`.

5. **Output Handling**: If the conditions for stair or peak are not met, it prints 'NONE'. This part is correct.

### Conclusion:

The current implementation of the peak condition check is incorrect because it uses `>` instead of `and >`. This means that if `b` is greater than `c` but not strictly so (e.g., `b == c`), the condition will still evaluate to true, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Correctness:

**False**

To fix the issue, the condition should be changed to `if a < b and b > c:`.
