Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a sorted list where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`; `present` is a set containing all elements from the list `a` minus one; `ans` is x - 2 + the sum of `gap` for each iteration where `y` is greater than or equal to half of `gap`, or 2 times `y` if `y` is less than half of `gap` and the loop breaks; `gaps` is a list containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a` plus `n` if it's the last element, modulo `n`; `gaps` is sorted.
