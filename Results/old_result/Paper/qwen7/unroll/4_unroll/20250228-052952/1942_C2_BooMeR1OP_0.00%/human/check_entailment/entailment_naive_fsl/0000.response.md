Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the vertices chosen by Bessie are not consecutive. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of additional triangles by adding vertices in gaps between the chosen vertices is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 2
1 3
```
In this case, the program should be able to add two more vertices to maximize the number of triangles. However, the current implementation does not account for the possibility of adding these vertices in a way that maximizes the number of triangles. The program only checks if the next vertex in the sequence is available and does not consider the optimal placement of additional vertices to form more triangles.

A correct approach would involve a more detailed analysis of the gaps between the chosen vertices and ensuring that the additional vertices are placed optimally to form the maximum number of triangles. The current implementation may miss this optimal placement, leading to an incorrect result.
