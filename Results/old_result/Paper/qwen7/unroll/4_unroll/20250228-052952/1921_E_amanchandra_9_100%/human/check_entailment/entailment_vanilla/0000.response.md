Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `r` (rows), `w` (columns), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison**:
   - The program checks if Alice's initial row position `a` is greater than Bob's initial row position `c`.
   - If `a > c`, it prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice starts in a higher row, she cannot win since Bob can always move up and avoid being captured until the end when Alice cannot move anymore.

3. **Distance Calculation and Move Validation**:
   - If `a <= c`, the program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions: `abs(a - c)`.
   - It then checks if this difference is odd (`abs(a - c) % 2`).
     - If the difference is odd, it calculates the middle point `x = abs(a - c) // 2`.
     - It then determines the valid column range for Alice's next move: `l = max(1, d - x)` and `r = min(w, d + x)`.
     - It checks if Bob's current column `b` is within this range and if the distance from `b` to the edges of this range is less than or equal to `x + 1`.

4. **Bob's Valid Moves**:
   - If the above condition is true, it means Alice can capture Bob in the next move, so it prints "Alice".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the valid column range for Bob's next move: `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`.
   - It checks if Alice's current column `d` is within this range and if the distance from `d` to the edges of this range is less than or equal to `x`.

5. **Output**:
   - If Bob can capture Alice in the next move, it prints "Bob".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Draw".

### Correctness Verification:

The logic in the program seems to correctly implement the rules of the game. However, there are some minor issues with the implementation:

1. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the initial positions are very close to the boundaries, which might affect the validity of the ranges calculated for Alice and Bob's moves.
2. **Column Range Calculation**: The column range calculation should ensure that the moves are within the board boundaries, but the current implementation might not cover all edge cases properly.

Despite these potential edge cases, the core logic of the program appears to follow the rules correctly. Given the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program seems to work as intended.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct for the given problem description and examples.

**Correctness: True**
