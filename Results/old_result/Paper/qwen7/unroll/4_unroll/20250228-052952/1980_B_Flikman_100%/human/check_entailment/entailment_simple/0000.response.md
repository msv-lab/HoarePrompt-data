Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the list of integers `a`.
3. It then sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
4. The program counts how many times the value of the favorite cube appears in the first `k` elements of the sorted list.
5. It compares this count with the total occurrences of the favorite value in the entire sorted list.
6. Based on these comparisons, it prints "YES", "NO", or "MAYBE" as required.

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` matches the requirements and correctly handles all the specified conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
