Output State: The output state is a series of integers printed for each test case. For each test case, if the number of '1's in strings `s` and `t` are equal (`s1 == t1`), the output is `s1` if the number of differing positions (`cnt`) is zero, otherwise it is `0`. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are different (`s1 != t1`), the output is half the count of differing positions adjusted by the absolute difference in the number of '1's, i.e., `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`, where `d = abs(s1 - t1)`.
