You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In order to test the hypothesis about the cats, the scientists must arrange
the cats in the boxes in a specific way. Of course, they would like to test
the hypothesis and publish a sensational article as quickly as possible,
because they are too engrossed in the next hypothesis about the phone's
battery charge.

Scientists have n boxes in which cats may or may not sit. Let the current
state of the boxes be denoted by the sequence b_1, \dots, b_n : b_i = 1 if
there is a cat in box number i , and b_i = 0 otherwise.

Fortunately, the unlimited production of cats has already been established, so
in one day, the scientists can perform one of the following operations:

  * Take a new cat and place it in a box (for some i such that b_i = 0 , assign b_i = 1 ). 
  * Remove a cat from a box and send it into retirement (for some i such that b_i = 1 , assign b_i = 0 ). 
  * Move a cat from one box to another (for some i, j such that b_i = 1, b_j = 0 , assign b_i = 0, b_j = 1 ). 

It has also been found that some boxes were immediately filled with cats.
Therefore, the scientists know the initial position of the cats in the boxes
s_1, \dots, s_n and the desired position f_1, \dots, f_n .

Due to the large amount of paperwork, the scientists do not have time to solve
this problem. Help them for the sake of science and indicate the minimum
number of days required to test the hypothesis.

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the number of boxes.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

The third line of each test case contains a string f of n characters, where
the i -th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i -th box and '0'
otherwise.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the minimum
number of operations required to obtain the desired position from the initial
position. It can be shown that a solution always exists.

Note

In the first test case, you can first move the cat from the first box to the
fifth, and then remove the cat from the fourth box.

In the second test case, there is nothing to do — the only cat is already
sitting in the correct box.

In the third test case of input data, it takes three days to place a cat in
each box.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and both s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

            print((cnt - d) // 2 + d)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the result printed for each test case after executing the given loop. For each test case, if the number of '1's in strings `s` and `t` are equal (`s1 == t1`), the output is `s1` if the number of differing positions (`cnt`) is zero, otherwise it is `0`. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are different (`s1 != t1`), the output is `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`, where `d` is the absolute difference between `s1` and `t1`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, the output state is a series of integers representing the results of the described logic for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two binary strings `s` and `t` of length `n`, counts the number of '1's in each string, and calculates the number of differing positions between the two strings. Based on whether the counts of '1's are equal or not, it prints either the count of '1's or a calculated value involving the count of differing positions and the absolute difference in '1's. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s` of the boxes, and the target state `t`.

2. **Counting Cats:**
   - It counts the number of cats in the initial state (`s1`) and the target state (`t1`).
   - If `s1` equals `t1`, it means the total number of cats remains the same, and we need to focus on the positions of the cats.
   - If `s1` does not equal `t1`, it calculates the difference `d` between the number of cats needed to be added or removed.

3. **Calculating Minimum Operations:**
   - If `s1` equals `t1`, it checks how many boxes have different states (`cnt`). Since the number of cats is the same, the minimum operations will be the number of boxes that need to be changed.
   - If `s1` does not equal `t1`, it calculates the minimum operations considering both moving and removing/replacing cats. The formula `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` accounts for the fact that each move operation involves two steps (one removal and one addition).

### Detailed Explanation

- **Case 1: `s1 == t1`**
  - If the number of cats is the same in both states, the minimum operations are simply the number of boxes that need to be changed (`cnt`).
  - This is because each change (moving a cat from one box to another) does not affect the total count of cats.

- **Case 2: `s1 != t1`**
  - If the number of cats changes, we need to consider both adding and removing cats.
  - The formula `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` correctly accounts for the minimum operations:
    - `d` is the absolute difference in the number of cats.
    - `cnt` is the number of boxes that need to be changed.
    - `(cnt - d) // 2` accounts for the moves where we need to balance the changes.
    - Adding `d` ensures that any necessary additions or removals are included.

### Correctness Verification

Given the logic and the formula used, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` into the target state `t`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state. Therefore, the given program is correct.
