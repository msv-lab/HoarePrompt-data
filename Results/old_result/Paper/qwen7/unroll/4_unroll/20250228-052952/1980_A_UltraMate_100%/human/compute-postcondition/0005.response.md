Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads integers \(n\) and \(m\), and a string \(s\) consisting of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the total number of additional occurrences of each character in the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'} needed to ensure each character appears at least \(m\) times in the string \(s\). If a character already appears more than \(m\) times, the excess is subtracted. The function outputs the sum of these adjustments for each test case.**
