You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters, each character is a letter from 'A' to 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:

                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of uppercase letters from A to G, and ans is an integer calculated based on the frequency of characters in s compared to m. After all iterations, ans contains the sum of additional occurrences of each character in p ('ABCDEFG') needed to match m in s, or the difference if there are more occurrences of a character in s than m allows.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads integers \(n\) and \(m\), and a string \(s\) consisting of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the total number of additional occurrences of each character in the set {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'} needed to ensure each character appears at least \(m\) times in the string \(s\). If a character already appears more than \(m\) times, the excess is subtracted. The function outputs the sum of these adjustments for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the additional problems needed for each difficulty level. 

Consider the following example:

- Input:
```
3
10 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

- Expected Output:
```
1
```

- Actual Output:
```
4
```

The program counts the occurrences of each difficulty level and calculates the difference between `m` and the count for each level. However, it fails to account for the fact that once a difficulty level is sufficient for the required rounds, no further problems of that level are needed. 

For the input `10 1 BBCDEFFGG`, the program should only need to add one problem of difficulty 'A' since none of the existing problems cover this level. Instead, the program incorrectly adds four problems (one for each missing difficulty level).

To fix this, the program should ensure that once a difficulty level's count meets or exceeds `m`, no further problems for that level are added.
