Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for q in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `q` and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is given as an input integer.
   - `q` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q < t`. Therefore, the loop will continue until `q` reaches `t`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `q` is initialized to 0, it needs to be set to 0.
   - `t` should be set to the value of the input integer `t`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `q` to 0 and `t` to the value of the input integer `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`x` is a string representing an integer, `y` is a string representing an integer, `t` is the input integer, `q` is 0**
