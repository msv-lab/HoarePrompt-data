Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle strings that are palindromes but can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. 

Consider the string `aaaa`. According to the problem description, this string can be partitioned into `a a a a`, which are all non-palindromic. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output `NO` for this case. 

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1(s) -> bool` checks if a string is a palindrome, which is correct.
2. In `func_2()`, the program attempts to find a non-palindromic substring by checking if the first character differs from subsequent characters. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. One way to do this is to check if the string itself is a palindrome and then attempt to partition it accordingly. Here's a revised version of the function that handles all cases correctly:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
    if s == s[::-1]:
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[:i] != s[:i][::-1] and s[i:] != s[i:][::-1]:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(s[:i], ' ', s[i:])
                return
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)

func_2()
```

This revised function first checks if the entire string is a palindrome. If it is, it tries to find a valid partition. If no valid partition is found, it outputs `NO`. Otherwise, it outputs `YES` along with the partition.
