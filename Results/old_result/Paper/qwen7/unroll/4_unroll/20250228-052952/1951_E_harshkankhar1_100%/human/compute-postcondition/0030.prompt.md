You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of the string s such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the input string)
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State: s is an input string, n is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is -1, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: s is an input string, n is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is either -1 or the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program does not return any value
    #State: `s` is an input string, `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`.
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :
            print('NO')
            #This is printed: NO
        else :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:]
        #State: `s` is an input string, `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`. The substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s`. If `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s` (rounded down), then no change occurs. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.
    #State: Postcondition: `s` is an input string, `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, and `func_1(s)` returns `True`. If the substring starting from index `x + 1` of `s` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`, then no change occurs. If the substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s` and `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s` (rounded down), then no change occurs. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program does not return any value

Case_2: The program does not return any value


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
