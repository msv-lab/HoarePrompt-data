Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, meaning `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character.
- `func_1(s)` returns `True`, indicating that the function `func_1` evaluates the string `s` and returns `True`.
- The substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s`.
- The value of `x` is neither 1 nor half of the length of `s` (i.e., `n // 2`).

Given this information, the `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string "YES" as specified.

Output: **YES**
