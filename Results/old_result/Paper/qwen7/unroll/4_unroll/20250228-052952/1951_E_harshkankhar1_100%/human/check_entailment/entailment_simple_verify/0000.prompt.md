You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

The substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s`. If `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s` (rounded down), then no change occurs. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.

If the substring starting from index `x + 1` of `s` does not satisfy the condition `func_1`, then no change occurs. If the substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s` and `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s` (rounded down), then no change occurs. Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle strings that are palindromes but can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. 

Consider the string `aaaa`. According to the problem description, this string can be partitioned into `a a a a`, which are all non-palindromic. However, the program does not account for this scenario and will incorrectly output `NO` for this case. 

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The function `func_1(s) -> bool` checks if a string is a palindrome, which is correct.
2. In `func_2()`, the program attempts to find a non-palindromic substring by checking if the first character differs from subsequent characters. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee a valid partition for all cases.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. One way to do this is to check if the string itself is a palindrome and then attempt to partition it accordingly. Here's a revised version of the function that handles all cases correctly:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input().strip()
    n = len(s)
    
    # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
    if s == s[::-1]:
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic substrings
        for i in range(1, n):
            if s[:i] != s[:i][::-1] and s[i:] != s[i:][::-1]:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(s[:i], ' ', s[i:])
                return
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)

func_2()
```

This revised function first checks if the entire string is a palindrome. If it is, it tries to find a valid partition. If no valid partition is found, it outputs `NO`. Otherwise, it outputs `YES` along with the partition.
