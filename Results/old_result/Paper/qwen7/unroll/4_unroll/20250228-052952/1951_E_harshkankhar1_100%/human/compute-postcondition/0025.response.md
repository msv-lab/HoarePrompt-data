Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is an input string.
   - `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, meaning `n = len(s)`.
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character. This means `s[x] != s[0]`.
   - `func_1(s)` returns `True`, so `s` must satisfy some condition defined by `func_1`.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` contains at least one character that matches the first character of `s`, i.e., there exists at least one `i > x` such that `s[i] == s[0]`.
   - `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])`.

Given these conditions, let's determine what will be printed:

- `s[:x + 2]`: This is the substring of `s` from the start up to (and including) the character at index `x + 1`.
- `s[x + 2:]`: This is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end of the string.

Since `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, `s[:x + 2]` will include the first character of `s` and the characters up to and including the first non-matching character. The substring `s[x + 2:]` will start right after this first non-matching character and continue to the end of the string.

Therefore, the print statement will output the substring `s[:x + 2]` followed by a space, and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.

Output: **s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:]**
