Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, n):` will start with `i = 1` and continue as long as `i < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - `s` is the input string and its length is used to calculate `n`, but `s` itself does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `x` is initialized to -1 and is not used in the loop, so it doesn't need adjustment.
   - `func_1(s)` returns `True`, which means the function validation is satisfied, but this does not affect the loop's execution.

4. **Formulate the final state**:
   - We need to ensure `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The values of `s`, `x`, and the result of `func_1(s)` do not need to be explicitly mentioned since they don't affect the loop's execution conditions.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 1**
