Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each a_i < 2^{31}). The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**

This means the function will take in a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer t and a list of integers a. It will process these according to the given constraints and return a result for each test case.
