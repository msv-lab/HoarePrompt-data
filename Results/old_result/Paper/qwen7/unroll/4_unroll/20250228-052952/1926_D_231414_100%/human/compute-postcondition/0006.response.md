Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It then calculates the number of unique elements in the list after performing a bitwise XOR operation with `2^31 - 1` on each element. Finally, it prints the total count of such unique elements for all test cases.**
