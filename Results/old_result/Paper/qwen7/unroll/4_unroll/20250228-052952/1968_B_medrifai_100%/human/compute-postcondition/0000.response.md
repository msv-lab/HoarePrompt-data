Output State: **`index` is the starting position of `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`, or -1 if `a[i]` is not found in that substring. `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and `i` and `j` remain their original values.**

This means that `index` is assigned the starting position of the character `a[i]` within the substring of `b` that starts at index `j`. If `a[i]` is not found in this substring, `index` will be `-1`. The binary strings `a` and `b`, along with the indices `i` and `j`, retain their original values.
