Reasoning:

1. The main loop iterates through each test case, correctly splitting the input into the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, and reading the strings themselves.
2. The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, representing the current indices in strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
3. The variable `c` keeps track of the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.
4. Inside the main loop, the function `func_1` is called with parameters `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. This function searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`.
5. If `func_1` finds the character, it updates `j` to the position after the found character and increments `i` and `c`.
6. If `func_1` does not find the character, the loop breaks, and the result `c` is printed.
7. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the remaining part of `b` starting from index `j`.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
