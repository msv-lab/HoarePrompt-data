You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the value of `j` plus the starting index of `a[i]` within the substring of `b`. If the character is not found, it returns `-1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for certain cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`. However, the logic inside `func_1` has a flaw. It uses `b[j:].find(a[i])`, which finds the first occurrence of `a[i]` starting from index `j` in `b`. This approach does not guarantee that the found index corresponds to the correct position in `b` relative to the current position `i` in `a`.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 5
100
11010
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
2
```

This happens because `func_1` finds the first '0' in `b` starting from index `2`, which is at index `3` in `b`. The program increments `j` to `3` and `i` to `2`, resulting in a count of `2` instead of `3`.

To fix this, the function should ensure that the found index in `b` is correctly aligned with the current position in `a`. One way to achieve this is by iterating through `b` and checking for the exact match of the substring starting from the current position in `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    while j < m:
        if b[j:j+i+1] == a[:i+1]:
            return j
        j += 1
    return -1
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all cases.
