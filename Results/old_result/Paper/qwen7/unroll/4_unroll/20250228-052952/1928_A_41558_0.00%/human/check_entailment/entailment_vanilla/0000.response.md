Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `n` times, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` representing the dimensions of the rectangles.

2. **Conditions for Printing 'NO':**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program prints 'NO'. This condition checks if both dimensions are odd, which means neither dimension can be evenly divided by 2. Since a rectangle can only be split into smaller rectangles by cutting along integer dimensions, if both dimensions are odd, no further splitting into different rectangles is possible without violating the integer side constraint.
   - If either `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`, the program also prints 'NO'. This condition checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other. In such cases, the only way to split the rectangle would result in the same dimensions but rotated, which does not count as forming a new rectangle.

3. **Condition for Printing 'YES':**
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'YES'. This implies that the rectangle can be split into smaller rectangles in a way that forms a new rectangle.

### Checking Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the logic against the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Both dimensions are 1, which are odd. Hence, the condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is true, and 'NO' is printed correctly.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `2 1`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: One dimension is 2 (even), and the other is 1 (odd). The condition `if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is false, but the condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is false, so 'NO' is printed correctly.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `2 6`
   - Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The dimensions are 2 and 6. The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is false, and `if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is false. Therefore, 'YES' is printed correctly.

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `3 2`
   - Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The dimensions are 3 and 2. The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is true, but since the dimensions are not both odd, the condition is false. The condition `if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is false. Therefore, 'YES' is printed correctly.

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `2 2`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: Both dimensions are 2, which are even. The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is false. The condition `if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is true (since 2 / 2 == 1). Therefore, 'NO' is printed correctly.

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `2 4`
   - Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The dimensions are 2 and 4. The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is false. The condition `if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is false. Therefore, 'YES' is printed correctly.

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `6 3`
   - Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: The dimensions are 6 and 3. The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is true, but since the dimensions are not both odd, the condition is false. The condition `if a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is false. Therefore, 'NO' is printed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions. All test cases are handled correctly according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
