Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where either \(a\) or \(b\) is equal to 1. According to the problem, a \(1 \times 1\) rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles, so the output should be "No". However, the current implementation incorrectly outputs "NO" for such cases.

For example, if the input is `1 1`, the program should output "No" but instead outputs "NO". Similarly, for any other dimensions where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the program should also output "No" if neither \(a\) nor \(b\) can be evenly divided to form another rectangle, but the current logic does not cover this fully.

To fix this, the program should explicitly check for the condition where both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and output "No" in such cases.
