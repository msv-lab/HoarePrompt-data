State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be true.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
4. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is set to 0.

Thus, the required state adjustments are:
- `t` remains as a positive integer within the given range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` must be 0.
