### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` of the three players.
   
2. **Initial Check for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it ends in a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the total score must be even for the scores to be achievable through the described game outcomes.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This value represents half of the total points scored by all players combined.
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the total points scored by the first two players.
   - Finally, it prints `min(x, y)`, which should represent the maximum possible number of draws. However, this calculation does not correctly account for the distribution of points among the players.

4. **Correct Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
     - Each draw gives 1 point to each player, contributing 2 points in total.
     - The remaining points (after accounting for draws) must be distributed such that the scores are consistent with the given constraints.
   - The correct approach would involve calculating the number of draws and then checking if the remaining points can be distributed between the players without violating the score constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:

**False**
