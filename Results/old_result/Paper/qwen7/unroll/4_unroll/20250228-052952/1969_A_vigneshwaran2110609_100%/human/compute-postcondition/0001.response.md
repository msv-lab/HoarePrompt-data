Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves three variables: `i`, `n`, and `p`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < n`. This means `i` will take values from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.

4. **Determine the Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `i` will start at `0` and increment until it reaches `n-1`.
   - The variable `n` is already defined and will remain constant throughout the loop.
   - The list `p` is defined but its contents are not specified in the initial state. However, we know that `p` contains `n` distinct integers between `1` and `n`, excluding the index `i`.

Given these points, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `p`, since `n` is already defined and does not change within the loop.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- Initially, `i` should be set to `0` because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
- The list `p` should be defined as a list of `n` distinct integers between `1` and `n`, excluding the index `i`.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `p` is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct**
