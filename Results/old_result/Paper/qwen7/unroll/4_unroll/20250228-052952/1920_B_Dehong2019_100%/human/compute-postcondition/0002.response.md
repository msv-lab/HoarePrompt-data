State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
- Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- No other variables or states need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head and their values do not directly control the loop's execution based on the given information.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.
