Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` for each test case.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in descending order, which is correct for maximizing the sum initially and for subsequent calculations.
3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `ans1` is calculated correctly by summing the entire sorted list.
4. **Alice's Optimal Move**: Alice can remove up to `k` elements. By removing the smallest elements, she maximizes the remaining sum. This part of the logic is correct.
5. **Bob's Optimal Move**: Bob can negate up to `x` elements. By negating the smallest elements, he minimizes the sum. The program correctly accounts for this by subtracting twice the value of the smallest elements (`a[i] * 2`) when calculating `ans1`.
6. **Combining Moves**: The program correctly combines Alice's and Bob's moves by iterating through the possible removals and negations, updating `ans2` to the maximum value of `ans1` after each combination of moves.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the program, it correctly implements the strategy for both players to play optimally based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
