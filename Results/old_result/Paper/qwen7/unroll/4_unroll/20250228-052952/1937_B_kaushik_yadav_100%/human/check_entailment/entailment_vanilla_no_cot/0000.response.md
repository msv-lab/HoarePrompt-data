Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction Logic**:
   - The logic to construct the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:` is not sufficient to ensure the smallest lexicographical path. This condition only checks if the current character in `b` is less than the next character in `a`, but it doesn't account for the overall lexicographical order when both characters are the same.
   - The logic should consider the entire sequence of jumps to ensure the smallest possible string is constructed.

2. **Incorrect Path Counting Logic**:
   - The counting logic for the number of paths is also incorrect. The current implementation only counts consecutive equal characters in `a` and `b`, which does not capture all valid paths that could lead to the lexicographically smallest string.

3. **Handling of Multiple Paths**:
   - The solution does not properly handle cases where there are multiple valid paths that result in the same lexicographically smallest string. The counting logic needs to be more robust to account for all such paths.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum lexicographical path and count the number of such paths. Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        # Initialize DP table
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(2)]
        dp[0][0] = 1
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(2):
                if j == 0:
                    if i > 0 and a[i-1] == '0':
                        dp[j][i] += dp[j][i-1]
                    if i < n and a[i] == '0':
                        dp[j][i] += dp[j][i-1]
                else:
                    if i > 0 and b[i-1] == '0':
                        dp[j][i] += dp[j][i-1]
                    if i < n and b[i] == '0':
                        dp[j][i] += dp[j][i-1]
        
        # Construct the lexicographically smallest path
        path = ''
        i, j = n-1, 1
        while i >= 0:
            if j == 1 and b[i] == '0':
                path = '0' + path
                i -= 1
            elif j == 0 and a[i] == '0':
                path = '0' + path
                i -= 1
            else:
                path = '1' + path
                j = 1 - j
                i -= 1
        
        print(path)
        print(dp[1][n-1])

# Call the function
func()
```

This solution uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid paths and constructs the lexicographically smallest path accordingly.
