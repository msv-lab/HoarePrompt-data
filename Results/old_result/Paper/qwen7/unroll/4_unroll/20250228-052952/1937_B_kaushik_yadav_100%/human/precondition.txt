t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5. Each test case consists of two binary strings of length n, representing the values of \(a_{1j}\) and \(a_{2j}\) for \(1 \leq j \leq n\), where each character in the strings is either '0' or '1'. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
