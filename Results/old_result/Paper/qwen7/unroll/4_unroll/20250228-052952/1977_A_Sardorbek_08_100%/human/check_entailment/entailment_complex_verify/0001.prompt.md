You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions given. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the values of `b` and `c` entered during each iteration. Since the initial value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, the output state is determined solely by the loop's conditions and the inputs provided within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( b \) and \( c \) (where \( 1 \leq b, c \leq 100 \)). For each test case, it prints one of four possible responses: 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The decision on which response to print is based on the values of \( b \) and \( c \) according to specified conditions. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `a` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves:
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it means all moves were additions.
     - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'. This is incorrect because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves if each move can only add or remove one cube.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'. This condition is not sufficient; it should check if the parity (even or odd nature) of `b` and `c` matches the possibility of achieving `c` cubes after `b` moves.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'. This part is also incorrect because it doesn't cover all cases where `b % 2 != c % 2`.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - To correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to ensure that the difference between `b` and `c` is even (since each move changes the count by 1).
   - Additionally, `b` must be at least `c` because you can't have more cubes than moves.

Given these points, the correct logic should be:
- Check if `b >= c`.
- Check if `(b - c) % 2 == 0`.

Now, let's modify the program accordingly:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

With this corrected logic, the program should now work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
