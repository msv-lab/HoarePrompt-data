The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in the string `s` are different. If no two consecutive characters are equal, it prints the count plus one; otherwise, it prints the count. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results.
