Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program reads `x` at the beginning and then uses this value in the loop, which means it processes all test cases with the same initial value of `x`. Instead, it should read `x` and `y` for each test case separately within the loop. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This corrected version reads `t` to determine the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually, correctly identifying the minimum and maximum values for each pair of inputs.
