You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x > y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9). Based on the comparison between `x` and `y`, it prints either `x, y` or `y, x`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs pairs of integers as specified.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Logic for Each Test Case**:
   - The program checks if `x` (from the current test case) is greater than `y`.
   - If `x > y`, it prints `x` followed by `y`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The expected output is to print the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1**: 
  - Input: `1 9`
  - Expected Output: `1 9`
  - Program Output: `1 9`

- **Test Case 2**: 
  - Input: `8 4`
  - Expected Output: `4 8`
  - Program Output: `4 8`

- **Test Case 3**: 
  - Input: `1 4`
  - Expected Output: `1 4`
  - Program Output: `1 4`

- **Test Case 4**: 
  - Input: `3 4`
  - Expected Output: `3 4`
  - Program Output: `3 4`

- **Test Case 5**: 
  - Input: `2 0`
  - Expected Output: `0 2`
  - Program Output: `0 2`

- **Test Case 6**: 
  - Input: `2 4`
  - Expected Output: `2 4`
  - Program Output: `2 4`

- **Test Case 7**: 
  - Input: `6 9`
  - Expected Output: `6 9`
  - Program Output: `6 9`

- **Test Case 8**: 
  - Input: `3 3`
  - Expected Output: `3 3`
  - Program Output: `3 3`

- **Test Case 9**: 
  - Input: `0 0`
  - Expected Output: `0 0`
  - Program Output: `0 0`

- **Test Case 10**: 
  - Input: `9 9`
  - Expected Output: `9 9`
  - Program Output: `9 9`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair of integers and prints them in the required format. There are no logical errors or discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.
