Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1()`. It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, iterates through the string `a`, and checks if each character of `a` is a subsequence in `b`.
2. The logic within the function is sound:
   - It initializes counters `k` and `j` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character of `a` using index `i`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it searches for a matching character in `b` starting from index `j`.
   - If a match is found, it increments both `k` and `j`.
   - If no match is found before reaching the end of `b`, it breaks out of the loop.
3. After the loop, the function prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum prefix length of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
4. The function returns `None`, which is appropriate since the output is already printed.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
