Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0, `j` is 0.**

The code initializes `j` to 0. Since `t`, `n`, `m`, and `b` were already defined in the initial state, their values remain unchanged. The value of `k` also remains 0. Therefore, the only new information is that `j` is now 0.
