Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. This does not affect the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, or `small_element`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values from the initial state.
