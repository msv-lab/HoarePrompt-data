The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. Both `left` and `right` are integers such that `left < right`, and `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range. The function does not return any value but modifies an array (not explicitly defined in the given information) within the range from `left` to `right` with the value of `clique`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills an array with the value `clique` starting from index `left` up to but not including index `right`.**
