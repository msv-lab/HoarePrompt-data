### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to issues in the `make_array` function. Let's re-evaluate the `make_array` function and the overall logic to confirm this conclusion.

#### Function `make_array` Analysis:

1. **Purpose of `make_array`:**
   - The function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays such that vertices within the same clique are close to each other in both index and value.
   - The logic provided in the function summary is flawed because it does not correctly form the required cliques.

2. **Flaws in `make_array`:**
   - The indices used in the assignment loops do not match the intended logic.
   - The logic for splitting the range and assigning values does not correctly form the required cliques.

Let's walk through the `make_array` function again:

```python
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

- **First Loop:**
  - `small_element + i` should be assigned to positions from `left + mid - 1` to `left`.
  - The current loop assigns values from `left + mid - 1` to `left + mid - i - 1`.

- **Second Loop:**
  - `big_element - i` should be assigned to positions from `left + mid` to `right`.
  - The current loop assigns values from `left + mid + i` to `left + mid + not_mid - 1`.

These assignments do not correctly form the required cliques as described in the problem statement. The indices and the logic for splitting the range are incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly form the required cliques, the function should ensure that vertices within the same clique are close to each other in both index and value. One possible correct approach could be:

```python
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        arr[i] = i - left + 1
        cliquess[i] = clique
```

This approach ensures that each vertex \( i \) is assigned a value \( i - left + 1 \), and all vertices in the range `[left, right]` belong to the same clique.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the flaws in the `make_array` function and the original assessment, the program is indeed incorrect. The provided solution does not correctly form the required cliques.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
