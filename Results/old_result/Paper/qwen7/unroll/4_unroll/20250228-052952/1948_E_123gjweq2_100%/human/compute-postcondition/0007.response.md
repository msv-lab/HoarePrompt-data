Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = not_mid - 1`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < not_mid`.

3. **Adjust States Based on the Loop Condition:**
   - We need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1, the loop will run as long as `i` is less than `not_mid`.

4. **Consider the Given States:**
   - `left` is an integer.
   - `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`.
   - `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier.
   - `small_element` is `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`.
   - `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`.
   - `arr` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left + mid - 1, left)` (inclusive), `arr[i] = small_element + (mid - 1 - i)`.
   - `cliquess` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1)` (inclusive), `cliquess[i] = clique`.

5. **Ensure `not_mid` is Greater Than 0:**
   - To ensure the loop executes, `not_mid` must be greater than 0.

### Final State Adjustment:

Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `not_mid` to be greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1` and must be greater than 0, `arr` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left + mid - 1, left)` (inclusive), `arr[i] = small_element + (mid - 1 - i)`, and `cliquess` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1)` (inclusive), `cliquess[i] = clique`.**
