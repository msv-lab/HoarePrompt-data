Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, R is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces**.

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `R`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\). The initial state of `L` is not relevant since `R` is used instead.
