The code `nums_left = L[-1] - 2` assigns the value of `L[-1] - 2` to `nums_left`. Given that `L[-1]` is a specific value from the initial state, let's denote it as `k`. Therefore, `nums_left` is set to `k - 2`.

The conditions and variables that are not affected by this line of code remain unchanged. So, `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `R` remains a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` equals 1 or `R[0]` equals `N`. The condition `(M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and (L[-2] == R[1]))` remains false; `ans` is calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `M1` is greater than 1.
