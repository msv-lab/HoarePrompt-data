Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. According to the problem description, the visibility period of each firework is \(m + 1\) minutes, but the program incorrectly uses \(m\) in the calculation. Specifically, the program calculates the number of fireworks as `m // a + m // b + 2`, which assumes the visibility period is \(m\) minutes instead of \(m + 1\).

For example, consider the input:
```
6 7 4
```
- The first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes.
- The second installation launches fireworks every 7 minutes.
- Each firework is visible for 5 minutes (since \(m = 4\), the visibility period is \(4 + 1 = 5\) minutes).

The correct approach would be to calculate the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period of 5 minutes. However, the program calculates `4 // 6 + 4 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2`, which is incorrect.

The correct calculation should be:
- Fireworks from the first installation: `5 // 6 + 1 = 1` (since the last launch before 5 minutes is at 4 minutes).
- Fireworks from the second installation: `5 // 7 + 1 = 1` (since the last launch before 5 minutes is at 4 minutes).

Thus, the total number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 + 1 = 2`. However, the program incorrectly prints `2` without considering the overlap correctly.

To fix this, the program should calculate the number of fireworks launched within the visibility period of \(m + 1\) minutes, which would give the correct result.
