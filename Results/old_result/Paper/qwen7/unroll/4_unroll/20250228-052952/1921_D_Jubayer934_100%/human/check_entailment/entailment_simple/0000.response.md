Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
4. It initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
5. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and compares each element with the corresponding element in the reversed `b` list (to maximize differences).
6. If a condition is met where swapping the current pair would increase the difference, it updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
7. After the loop, if `temp` is not `-1`, it appends the remaining differences using the updated index.
8. Finally, it prints the sum of the differences.

The logic seems sound and should achieve the goal of maximizing the total difference \(D\). However, there is a potential issue with the logic used to determine when to swap elements. Specifically, the condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` might not always be the best way to maximize the differences. Instead, we should directly compare the current element in `a` with the next largest element in `b` to ensure the maximum difference.

However, the overall approach of sorting and comparing the elements is correct. The provided code should work as intended, given the constraints and the nature of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
