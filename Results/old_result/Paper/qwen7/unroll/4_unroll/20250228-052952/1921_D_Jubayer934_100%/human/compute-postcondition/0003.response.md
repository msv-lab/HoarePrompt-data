Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) such that the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, for each pair (n, m), there are corresponding integers a_i and b_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of values for t, n, m, a_i, and b_i, and it processes these inputs to produce some form of output for each test case, though the specific nature of the output is not detailed in the given information.
