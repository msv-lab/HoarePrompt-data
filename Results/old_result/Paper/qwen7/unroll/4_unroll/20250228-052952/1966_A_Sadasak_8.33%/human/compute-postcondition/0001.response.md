Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `num` and the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers representing the numbers on the cards.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 100\).
   - `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, assigning each element to `num` in each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each element in `arr`, `num` will take on each value from `arr` in turn.
   - The initial state of `arr` and `k` does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the context.
   - The `frequency_table` is initially empty, and the loop will populate it with counts of each number in `arr`.

Given the above points, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that the loop can start iterating over the elements of `arr`. This means `arr` must contain at least one element.

**Final State**:
- `arr` must contain at least one element.
- `k` remains as an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 100\).
- `frequency_table` remains an empty dictionary.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`arr` must contain at least one element, `k` is an integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 100\), `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.
