### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Array Calculation:**
   - The program initializes arrays `a` and `pf` where `pf[i]` stores the prefix XOR up to index `i-1`.
   - It also uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, the subarray is considered interesting because it can be divided into one part with XOR 0.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split by using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices in the mapped lists.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the indices are within bounds and checking the conditions properly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the conditions checked and prints the results at the end.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for determining if the subarray is interesting. The program incorrectly assumes that a subarray is interesting if its XOR is zero. According to the problem description, a subarray is interesting if it can be divided into `k > 1` parts such that the XOR of each part is equal. A subarray with XOR zero can only be divided into one part (the subarray itself), which does not satisfy the condition `k > 1`.

To correctly determine if a subarray is interesting, the program needs to check if there are multiple indices where the prefix XOR value matches the XOR of the subarray. Specifically, for a subarray to be interesting, there must be at least two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`) such that `pf[j] ^ pf[i-1] == 0`.

### Corrected Logic:
1. Calculate the prefix XOR array `pf`.
2. For each query, calculate the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
3. Check if there are at least two distinct indices `i` and `j` (with `i < j`) such that `pf[j] == pf[i-1]`. This ensures that the subarray can be split into `k > 1` parts with equal XOR values.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program incorrectly assumes that a subarray with XOR zero is interesting. The correct approach requires checking for multiple indices where the prefix XOR value matches the XOR of the subarray.

**Final: False**
