Output: **YES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO** 

Explanation:
- `index` is explicitly given as 6.
- `t` is the integer value from the list `data` at position 0. However, since the actual list `data` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `t`. But this detail is not needed to determine the output of the `print` statement.
- `results` is a list containing alternating 'YES' and 'NO' based on the queries processed during the loop execution. Since no specific queries or conditions are mentioned, we assume that the loop processed enough queries to generate a list with 6 elements, alternating between 'YES' and 'NO'. Therefore, the list `results` would be ['YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO', 'YES', 'NO'].

Hence, the `'\n'.join(results)` statement will join these elements into a single string with each element separated by a newline character, resulting in the output: **YES\nNO\nYES\nNO\nYES\nNO**.
