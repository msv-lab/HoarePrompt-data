Output State: **`index` is 2; `t` is an integer value from the list `data` at position 0; `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `index` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `index` is still 2, and `t` retains its initial value which is an integer from the list `data` at position 0. The new list `results` is created but is currently empty.
