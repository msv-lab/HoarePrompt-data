The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t, followed by integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,...,a_n. For each query (l, r), it determines whether the XOR of the subarray from index l to r is zero. If the XOR is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it prints the results list, which contains alternating 'YES' and 'NO' based on the queries processed.
