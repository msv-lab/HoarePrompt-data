Reasoning:
1. The program reads input data and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `q`, and the array `a`.
3. It uses prefix XOR (`pf`) to efficiently compute the XOR of any subarray.
4. It maintains a dictionary (`mp`) to store indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
5. For each query `(l, r)`, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
6. If the XOR of the subarray is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'.
7. The logic for checking if the subarray can be split into equal XOR parts is correctly implemented by ensuring there exists a valid split point within the range `[l, r]`.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the XOR operation.

Correctness: **True**
