Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the value of t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is considered, and the sum of n·m over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function returns information about the grid based on the given constraints.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each with its own grid of size n x m, where n and m are dimensions of the grid, and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also considers a positive integer t for each test case, ensuring 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and ensures that the total number of cells across all grids (sum of n·m) does not exceed 3·10^5. The exact return value is not specified in the problem statement, but it implies that the function provides some form of analysis or summary based on the grid data and the value of t for each test case.
