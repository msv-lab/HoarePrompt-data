Reasoning:
1. The given solution attempts to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by checking if the first row or the last row is uniform and different from the other rows.
2. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider all possible configurations of the grid that could allow all squares to become the same color through the allowed operations.
3. Specifically, the solution fails to check if there are any columns that contain only one color throughout the entire grid, which would allow those columns to be made uniform through the allowed operations.
4. The solution also does not account for the possibility of making the entire grid uniform by performing operations on rows or columns that are not necessarily the first or last rows.

Given these issues, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
