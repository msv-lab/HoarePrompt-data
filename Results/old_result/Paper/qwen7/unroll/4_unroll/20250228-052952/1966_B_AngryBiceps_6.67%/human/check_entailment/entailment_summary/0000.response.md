Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations.
2. The provided solution checks two specific conditions:
   - Whether the first row is uniform (all 'W' or all 'B') and different from the last row.
   - Whether any row is uniform and different from its corresponding first or last row.
3. However, these conditions are not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. The solution fails to consider other configurations where it might still be possible to achieve the goal.
4. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are different but all other rows are the same and different from the first and last rows. The provided solution would incorrectly output 'NO' for such cases.
5. A more comprehensive approach would involve checking if there exists a way to unify the entire grid through the allowed operations, which is not covered by the current implementation.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. It only checks specific conditions that are insufficient to cover all scenarios.
