Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Specifically, the program checks only the first row and the last row for uniformity and does not consider other rows or columns. This approach is insufficient because the problem requires checking all rows and columns to ensure they can eventually be made uniform through the specified operations.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB
```

The program would correctly output "YES" for this case since all squares are already the same color. However, consider another grid:

```
3 3
BBB
BBW
BBB
```

The program would incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks the first and last rows, missing the fact that the middle row disrupts uniformity. To properly solve this problem, the program needs to check all rows and columns to ensure they can be made uniform.
