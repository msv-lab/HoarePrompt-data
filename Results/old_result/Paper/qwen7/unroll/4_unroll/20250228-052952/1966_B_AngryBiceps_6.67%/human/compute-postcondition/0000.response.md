Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range()` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as the input value is a positive integer and it is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value meets the criteria for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that the input value is within the specified range.

**State after adjustment**:
- The input value must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
