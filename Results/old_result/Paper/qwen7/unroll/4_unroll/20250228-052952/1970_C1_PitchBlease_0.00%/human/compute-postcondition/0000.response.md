Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree.**

The code initializes a queue with a single element, which is a tuple containing the starting node (`start`) and a distance of `0`. The values of `start` and `target` remain unchanged from their initial state.
