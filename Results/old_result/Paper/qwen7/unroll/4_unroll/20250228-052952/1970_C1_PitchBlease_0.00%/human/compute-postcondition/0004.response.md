Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection in the tree.**

Explanation: The code creates a list called `leaves` which contains all the nodes in the tree that have exactly one connection (i.e., leaf nodes). These nodes are identified by checking if the length of the list of connected nodes (`tree[node]`) is equal to 1. The `edges` list and the `start` variable remain unchanged from their initial state.
