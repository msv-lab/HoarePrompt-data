Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` has hardcoded logic that checks if `removals` is equal to 6 and `negatives` is equal to 3, and returns 0 in that case. This hardcoded check is not based on the problem description and does not account for other possible values of `removals` and `negatives`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
```
4 1 1
3 1 2 4
```

According to the problem description, Alice can remove at most 1 element, and Bob can multiply at most 1 element by -1. The optimal strategy would be for Alice to remove the smallest element (1), and for Bob to multiply the largest element (4) by -1. The resulting array would be [3, 1, -4], and the sum would be 0.

However, the program incorrectly returns 2 because it does not dynamically calculate the optimal strategy based on the input values but instead uses a hardcoded condition. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
