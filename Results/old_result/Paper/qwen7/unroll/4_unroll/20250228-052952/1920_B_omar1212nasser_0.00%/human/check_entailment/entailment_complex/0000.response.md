Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the list of integers `a`.
   - The list `a` is sorted, and then `func_2(k, x, a)` is called to compute the product value.
   - The computed value is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` has a conditional check that returns 0 if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`.
   - If the condition is not met, it calculates the sum of all elements in `elements` (`s`) and the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` (`n`).
   - It then computes the values of `s - 2 * n` for each possible number of removals up to the given `removals` and stores these values in a list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the sum of the array.
   - Bob's goal is to minimize the sum of the array.
   - Alice can remove at most `k` elements.
   - Bob can multiply at most `x` elements by `-1`.

4. **Function `func_2` Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It does not consider the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Specifically, the function does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob will play optimally to achieve their respective goals.
   - The function only checks for a specific condition and returns 0 without considering the actual optimal moves.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples show that the function does not handle the optimal strategies correctly. For instance, in the fifth test case, the function returns 0, which is incorrect based on the optimal strategy.

Given the analysis, the function `func_2` does not implement the optimal strategy for both players, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
