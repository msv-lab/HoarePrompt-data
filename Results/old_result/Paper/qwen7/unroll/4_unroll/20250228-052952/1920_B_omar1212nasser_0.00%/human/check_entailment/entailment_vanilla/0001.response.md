Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It calls `func_2` with parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - It prints the result returned by `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can negate), and `elements` (the array).
   - It uses a conditional statement to return `0` if `removals` is `6` and `negatives` is `3`. This is a hardcoded condition and might not cover all scenarios.
   - It initializes an empty list `pos` to store possible sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of all elements in `elements`.
   - It calculates the sum `n` of the last `negatives` elements.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos`, which represents the sum if Alice removes no elements and Bob negates the last `negatives` elements.
   - It iterates from `1` to `removals` and updates `s` and `n` in each iteration:
     - Subtracts the `i-th` largest element from `s`.
     - Adds the difference between the `(negatives + i)-th` and `i-th` largest elements to `n`.
     - Appends the updated `s - 2 * n` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Hardcoded Condition**:
   - The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is hardcoded and might not cover all scenarios. This could lead to incorrect results for other values of `removals` and `negatives`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, it assumes that Bob will always negate the smallest `negatives` elements, which is not necessarily true. Bob might choose to negate different elements to minimize the sum more effectively.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array has fewer than `negatives` elements or when `removals` and `negatives` are very small or large.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:
- Alice should remove the smallest `removals` elements to maximize the remaining sum.
- Bob should negate the smallest `negatives` elements to minimize the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob negates the smallest x elements
        a = [-el if i < x else el for i, el in enumerate(a)]
        
        print(sum(a))

# Example usage
func_1()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the hardcoded condition and the flawed logic in handling the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
