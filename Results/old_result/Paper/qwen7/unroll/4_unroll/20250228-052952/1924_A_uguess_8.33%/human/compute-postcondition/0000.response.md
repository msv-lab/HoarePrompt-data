Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^5, and we read an input for `t`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` is now an integer within the specified range, and we have read an input for `t`.
