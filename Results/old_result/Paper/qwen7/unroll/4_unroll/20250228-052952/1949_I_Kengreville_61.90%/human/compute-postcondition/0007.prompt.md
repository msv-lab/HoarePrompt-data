You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of disks, x is a list of integers where x[i] represents the x-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk, y is a list of integers where y[i] represents the y-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk, r is a list of integers where r[i] represents the radius of the i-th disk, visited is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each disk has been visited, and coef0 and coef1 are lists of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS traversal.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: All `visited[j]` are `True`; `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated based on the conditions; `nodes` remains unchanged.
    #State: All `visited[j]` are `True`; `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated based on the conditions; `nodes` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `i`, which is an index. It does not return any value but performs operations related to Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on disks using the provided indices, coordinates, radii, visited status, and coefficient lists.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
