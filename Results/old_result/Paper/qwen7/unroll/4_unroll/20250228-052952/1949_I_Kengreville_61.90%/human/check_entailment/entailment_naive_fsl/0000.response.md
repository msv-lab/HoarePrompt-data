Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the radii of the disks can be changed in the desired manner. Specifically, the `func_1` function and the `dfs` function do not properly handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Coefficients**: The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are not being updated correctly to ensure that the tangency conditions are maintained while decreasing the sum of the radii. The current implementation does not guarantee that the sum of the radii will strictly decrease.

2. **No Decrease in Sum of Radii**: The program does not check if the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. The current logic only checks if the tangency condition is met, but it does not ensure that the sum of the radii decreases.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

However, the provided program would not correctly determine this. It needs to ensure that the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap. The current implementation does not handle this requirement adequately.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
