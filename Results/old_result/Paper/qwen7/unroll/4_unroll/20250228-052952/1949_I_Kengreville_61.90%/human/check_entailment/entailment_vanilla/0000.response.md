### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each disk can be represented as a node in a graph.
   - An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The problem reduces to finding a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency conditions.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) which represent the relationships between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are calculated based on the relationship between the radii of the current disk and its tangent neighbors.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If any `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it means there is a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii decreases.
   - The logic checks if there is at least one node where `coef1[j]` is non-zero.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent and ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced without violating the tangency condition.

6. **Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary variables and starts the DFS process.
   - The `dfs` function updates the coefficients and recursively explores the graph.

### Analysis:
- The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to reduce the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total radius sum.
- The DFS approach ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are considered.
- The use of coefficients helps in determining the feasibility of reducing the radii.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
