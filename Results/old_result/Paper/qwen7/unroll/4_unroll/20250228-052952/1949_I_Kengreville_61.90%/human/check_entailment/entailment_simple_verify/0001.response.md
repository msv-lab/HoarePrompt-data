### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires adjusting the radii of disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each disk is represented as a node in a graph.
   - An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The problem reduces to finding a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency conditions.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) which represent the relationships between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are calculated based on the relationship between the radii of the current disk and its tangent neighbors.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The logic checks if there is at least one node where `coef1[j]` is non-zero, indicating a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii decreases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent and ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced without violating the tangency condition.

6. **Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary variables and starts the DFS process.
   - The `dfs` function updates the coefficients and recursively explores the graph.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary lists and reads the input data.
  - The `visited` list keeps track of which disks have been processed.
  - The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are initialized to `None`.

- **DFS Traversal**:
  - The `dfs` function is called for each unvisited disk.
  - For each disk, it calculates the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
  - If the disks are tangent, the coefficients are updated accordingly.
  - The `dfs` function recursively processes all connected disks.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - After processing all disks, the `func_1` function checks if any `coef1[j]` is non-zero.
  - If any `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it prints "YES" because it indicates a feasible way to reduce the radii.
  - If no `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it prints "NO".

### Issues Identified:

1. **Coefficient Calculation**:
   - The coefficient calculation in `dfs` is based on the assumption that the disks are tangent. However, the code does not handle the case where multiple disks are tangent to each other.
   - The coefficients are only updated for the first disk in the DFS traversal, and subsequent disks do not update their coefficients correctly.

2. **Sum of Radii Decrease**:
   - The code does not ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases. It only checks for the possibility of reducing the radii without overlapping, but it does not enforce the strict decrease condition.

3. **Tangency Condition**:
   - The code assumes that the tangency condition is sufficient to ensure the sum of radii can be decreased. However, this is not always true. There might be cases where the tangency condition alone does not guarantee a feasible reduction in the sum of radii.

### Conclusion:

The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the sum of radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency. The coefficient calculation and the feasibility check are incomplete and do not cover all necessary conditions.
