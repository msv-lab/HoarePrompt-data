The function reads the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on each unvisited disk, updating certain coefficients and tracking visited disks. Finally, it checks if any DFS resulted in a non-zero coefficient sum and prints 'YES' if so, otherwise 'NO'. The function ensures all disks are visited and modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists accordingly.
