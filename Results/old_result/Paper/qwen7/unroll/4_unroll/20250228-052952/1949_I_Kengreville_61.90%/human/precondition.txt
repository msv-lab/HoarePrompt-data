The input consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) followed by n lines, each containing three integers x_i, y_i, and r_i (-10^9 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ r_i ≤ 10^9) representing the coordinates of the center and the radius of the i-th disk. No two disks overlap in a region of positive area, but they may be tangent to each other.
