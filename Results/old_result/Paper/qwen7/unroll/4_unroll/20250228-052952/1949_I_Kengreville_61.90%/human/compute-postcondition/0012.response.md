Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`. These are the only variables that can be adjusted according to the given constraints.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is the length of the list `visited`, which is given as `n`.

3. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it should be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `x` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `y` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `r` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `coef0` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `nodes` is an empty list, `ok` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
