You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of disks and their respective coordinates and radii. It then performs a depth-first search (DFS) on each unvisited disk, updating certain coefficients and tracking visited disks. Finally, it checks if any DFS resulted in a non-zero coefficient sum and prints 'YES' if so, otherwise 'NO'. The function ensures all disks are visited and modifies the `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists accordingly.

    #State: All `visited[j]` are `True`; `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated based on the conditions; `nodes` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs(i)` performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from disk `i`. It marks the current disk as visited, adds its index to the `nodes` list, and recursively visits all directly touching unvisited disks. After visiting all such disks, all disks are marked as visited, their corresponding coefficients are updated based on the touching condition, and the `nodes` list remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each disk can be represented as a node in a graph.
   - An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The problem reduces to finding a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency conditions.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) which represent the relationships between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are calculated based on the relationship between the radii of the current disk and its tangent neighbors.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If any `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it means there is a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii decreases.
   - The logic checks if there is at least one node where `coef1[j]` is non-zero.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent and ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced without violating the tangency condition.

6. **Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary variables and starts the DFS process.
   - The `dfs` function updates the coefficients and recursively explores the graph.

### Analysis:
- The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if it's possible to reduce the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and decreasing the total radius sum.
- The DFS approach ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are considered.
- The use of coefficients helps in determining the feasibility of reducing the radii.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
