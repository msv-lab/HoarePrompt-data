### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if we can adjust the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - Each disk can be represented as a node in a graph.
   - An edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The problem reduces to finding a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency conditions.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) which represent the relationships between the radii of tangent disks.
   - `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are calculated based on the relationship between the radii of the current disk and its tangent neighbors.

4. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If any `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it means there is a feasible way to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and ensuring the sum of radii decreases.
   - The logic checks if there is at least one node where `coef1[j]` is non-zero.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where disks are tangent and ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced without violating the tangency condition.

6. **Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary variables and starts the DFS process.
   - The `dfs` function updates the coefficients and recursively explores the graph.

### Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - The `func_1` function initializes the necessary variables including `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` lists. It also initializes the `nodes` list to keep track of nodes during the DFS traversal.
  - The `for` loop iterates over all disks and calls the `dfs` function for unvisited disks.

- **DFS Function**:
  - The `dfs` function marks the current disk as visited and adds its index to the `nodes` list.
  - For each unvisited disk that is tangent to the current disk, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1`.
  - The `dfs` function recursively visits all tangent disks.

- **Coefficient Calculation**:
  - The coefficients `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are calculated based on the relationship between the radii of the current disk and its tangent neighbors.
  - Specifically, `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - After performing the DFS for each unvisited disk, the function checks if any `coef1[j]` is non-zero.
  - If any `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it sets `ok` to `True`, indicating that it is possible to reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and decreasing the sum of radii.
  - If no `coef1[j]` is non-zero, it sets `ok` to `False`, indicating that it is not possible to achieve the desired condition.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness**:
  - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and performs a DFS to update the coefficients.
  - The logic for checking the feasibility of reducing the radii while maintaining tangency and decreasing the sum of radii is sound.
  - The code handles all edge cases, including the case where disks are tangent and the sum of radii can be reduced without violating the tangency condition.

  - The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code match the behavior of the program and support the original assessment.
