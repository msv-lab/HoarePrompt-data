The function `dfs(i)` performs a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal starting from disk `i`. It marks the current disk as visited, adds its index to the `nodes` list, and recursively visits all directly touching unvisited disks. After visiting all such disks, all disks are marked as visited, their corresponding coefficients are updated based on the touching condition, and the `nodes` list remains unchanged.
