Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates two possible total costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually, which is `a * n`.
   - `ans2`: The cost if yogurts are bought in pairs under promotion, which is `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`. This formula ensures that if `n` is odd, one additional yogurt is bought at the individual price `a`.
4. It then prints the minimum of these two costs.
5. The logic handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly, ensuring the minimum cost is always printed.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
