Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where buying in pairs (using the promotion price) is more advantageous than buying individually, especially when `n` is odd. 

For example, in the third test case of the provided example (3 5 11), the program calculates the cost as follows:
- `ans1 = a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`
- `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2 = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`

However, the correct minimum cost should be 15, which is achieved by buying two yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and one yogurt at the regular price (5 burles). The program incorrectly calculates `ans2` because it does not handle the case where the number of yogurts is odd and the promotion price is more beneficial.

To fix this, the program should adjust the calculation of `ans2` to ensure it correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd.
