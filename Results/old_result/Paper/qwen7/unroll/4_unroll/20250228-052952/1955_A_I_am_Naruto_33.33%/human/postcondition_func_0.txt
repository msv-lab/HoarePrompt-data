The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts either by buying them individually or in pairs, depending on which option is cheaper. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.
