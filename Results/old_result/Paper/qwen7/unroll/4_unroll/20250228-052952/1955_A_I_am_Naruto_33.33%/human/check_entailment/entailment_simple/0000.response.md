Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It then calculates two possible costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - `ans2`: The cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * n // 2`) and then adding the cost of any remaining single yogurt (`a * n % 2`).
4. The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated costs.
5. The logic handles the edge case where `n` is 1 by simply printing the cost of one yogurt (`a`).

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
