You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of yogurts `n`, the price for one yogurt `a`, and the price for two yogurts on promotion `b`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts either by buying them individually or in pairs, depending on which option is cheaper. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Calculation for Single Yogurt Purchase**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a`, which is the price of one yogurt. This is correct because if only one yogurt is needed, there's no benefit from the promotion.

3. **Calculation for Multiple Yogurts Purchase**:
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which is the optimal cost for buying `n` yogurts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by printing just `a`.
   - The logic for calculating `ans2` ensures that the promotion is used optimally, considering both full pairs and any leftover single yogurt.

5. **Output**:
   - The output matches the expected format and values as shown in the example.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts, considering both the regular and promotional prices. It handles all given test cases accurately.

Correctness: **True**
