Output State: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the result of the computation based on the conditions given in the loop body. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
