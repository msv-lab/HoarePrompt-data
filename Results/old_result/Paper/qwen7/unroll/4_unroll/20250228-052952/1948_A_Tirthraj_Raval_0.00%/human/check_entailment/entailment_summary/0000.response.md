Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO', as it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string.
- For even `n`, the solution generates a string with alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which ensures that every character (except possibly the first and last) is a special character since it will always match one neighbor and not the other.
- The generated string has a length of `n`, which is within the allowed limit of 200 characters for the solution.
- The logic and implementation appear to align with the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
