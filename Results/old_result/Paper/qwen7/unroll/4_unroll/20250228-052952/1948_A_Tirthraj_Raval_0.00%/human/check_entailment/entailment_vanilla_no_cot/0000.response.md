Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as defined in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Pattern Generation**: The current implementation generates a pattern using 'A' and 'B', but it doesn't ensure that exactly `n` characters will be special. For example, for `n = 6`, it generates "ABABAB", which has only 2 special characters (positions 2 and 4), not 6.

2. **Special Character Definition**: A character is considered special if it is different from exactly one of its neighbors. This means that for a string like "AAABAACC", the special characters are indeed at positions where they differ from their neighbors, but the pattern generation logic needs to be adjusted to ensure this condition is met for exactly `n` characters.

To fix this, you need to generate a pattern that ensures exactly `n` special characters. One way to do this is to use a repeating pattern of "AB" and adjust the pattern to meet the requirement. Here’s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            # Generate a pattern with exactly n special characters
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n):
                if i % 2 == 0:
                    pattern.append('A')
                else:
                    pattern.append('B')
            # Ensure the pattern has exactly n special characters
            if len(set(pattern[i] + pattern[i+1] for i in range(len(pattern)-1))) != n // 2:
                # Adjust the pattern to ensure exactly n special characters
                pattern[0] = 'B'
                for i in range(1, n-1, 2):
                    pattern[i] = 'A'
            print(''.join(pattern))
```

This corrected version ensures that the generated pattern has exactly `n` special characters by adjusting the pattern dynamically.
