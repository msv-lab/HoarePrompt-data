Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution checks if `n` is odd. If it is, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters with the given construction method (alternating characters).
- If `n` is even, it constructs a pattern using alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which will result in every character being special except the first and last ones. This is because each character in the middle will have one neighbor that matches and one that doesn't, making it special. The first and last characters will not be special since they do not have both neighbors.
- The constructed pattern is then printed, and the solution correctly handles all given constraints and examples.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
