You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 50 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters repeated n//2 times. After processing all test cases, it ends without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checking for Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters in a string where each special character must be different from exactly one of its neighbors.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - The program generates a string using a pattern where every pair of characters alternates between 'A' and 'B'.
   - Specifically, it uses the pattern 'AB' and repeats it `n // 2` times.
   - This ensures that each character in the generated string has exactly one neighbor that is different, making all characters special except the first and last ones in the pattern.

4. **Constructing the Pattern:**
   - The pattern is constructed by appending 'A' and 'B' alternately.
   - For example, if `n = 6`, the pattern would be 'ABABAB', which has 6 special characters (all but the first and last).

5. **Output:**
   - If the pattern is successfully generated, it prints 'YES' followed by the generated string.
   - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'.

### Testing the Program with Examples:

- **Test Case 1: `n = 6`**
  - `n` is even, so the program should generate a string with 6 special characters.
  - The output should be:
    ```
    YES
    ABABAB
    ```

- **Test Case 2: `n = 1`**
  - `n` is odd, so the program should print 'NO'.
  - The output should be:
    ```
    NO
    ```

- **Test Case 3: `n = 2`**
  - `n` is even, so the program should generate a string with 2 special characters.
  - The output should be:
    ```
    YES
    AB
    ```

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both even and odd values of `n`. For even `n`, it generates a string with exactly `n` special characters. For odd `n`, it correctly prints 'NO'. The generated strings are valid according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
