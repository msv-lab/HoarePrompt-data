Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as required. For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. The program will output "NO" because it checks if `n` is even and prints "NO" if `n` is odd. However, for `n = 1`, a valid string would be "A" since 'A' is a special character (it has no neighbors). Therefore, the program fails to handle the case when `n` is odd and should output "YES" followed by a string like "A".
