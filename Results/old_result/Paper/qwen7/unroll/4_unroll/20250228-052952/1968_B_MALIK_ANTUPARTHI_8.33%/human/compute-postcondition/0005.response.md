Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers \( n \) and \( m \), and binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then finds the first occurrence of any character from string \( a \) in string \( b \) and prints the index of this occurrence. If no such character is found, it prints the length of string \( b \). This process is repeated for each test case specified by the input integer \( t \).**
