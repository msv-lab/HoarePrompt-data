Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = input()
        
        e = input()
        
        k = 0
        
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        
        print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer input from the user, b and c are integers input from the user, d is a string input from the user, e is a string input from the user, and k is an integer with the value determined by the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts integers \( n \) and \( m \), and binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then finds the first occurrence of any character from string \( a \) in string \( b \) and prints the index of this occurrence. If no such character is found, it prints the length of string \( b \). This process is repeated for each test case specified by the input integer \( t \).
