Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Matching Conditions**: The program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it prints "NO". This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the conditions for matching templates as described in the problem statement.

2. **Template Matching Logic Missing**: The program should check if there exists a template where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. The current implementation does not correctly implement this logic.

3. **Early Exit**: The program breaks out of the loop and prints "YES" as soon as it finds a character in `c` that is not in `a` or `b`. This is incorrect because it does not account for the case where `a` and `b` might have some characters that do not match `c` but still satisfy the template conditions.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input().lower()
        b = input().lower()
        c = input().lower()
        no = True
        
        # Check if there exists a template where a and b match but c does not
        for i in range(slength):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                no = False
                break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This solution correctly checks if there exists a template where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not, according to the problem's conditions.
