Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation and returns a result based on the input values.**

Note: The exact operation is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the structure and nature of the input rather than the specific processing details.
