Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it checks if the string c contains any characters that are not present in either string a or b. If c contains any such characters, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' responses corresponding to each test case.**
