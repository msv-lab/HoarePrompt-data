Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings and the strings themselves.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `no` to `True`, which will be used to determine if the conditions are met.
4. The program first checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `c` is equal to `b`. If either condition is true, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`.
5. If `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`, it then checks each character in `c` to see if it is present in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in either `a` or `b`, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False`, breaking out of the loop.
6. If no character in `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, and the above conditions are not met, it prints "NO".
7. The logic described in the annotated program aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
