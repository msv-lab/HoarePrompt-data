Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic**: The program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers. The logic should account for the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations optimally.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`n=5`, `k=3`), the correct answer should be 2 (as shown in the problem statement), but the program incorrectly outputs `2` (which is `3 - 1`).
   - For the second test case (`n=1`, `k=10`), the correct answer is 1, but the program outputs `9` (which is `10 - 1`).
   - For the fourth test case (`n=10`, `k=4`), the correct answer is 3, but the program outputs `3` (which is `4 - 1`).

3. **General Case**: The program fails to consider the distribution of card numbers and always outputs `k - 1`, which is not the correct approach.

Correctness: **False**
