Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. After executing the loop, done is a set containing elements from a that were matched with elements in todo at least k times. todo is a set of remaining unmatched elements from b. extra is a set of elements from a that were not matched with any element in b. ans is an integer representing the number of complete cycles where at least k elements from b were matched with elements in a.
