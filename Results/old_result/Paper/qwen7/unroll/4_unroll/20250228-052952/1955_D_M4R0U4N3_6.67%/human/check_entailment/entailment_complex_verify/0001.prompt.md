You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. After executing the loop, todo is a set of integers, done is a set of integers, extra is a set of integers, and ans is an integer such that 0 ≤ ans ≤ (n - m + 1). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it determines the number of times a subset of elements from list a can be transformed into a subset of elements from list b, such that the size of the transformed subset meets or exceeds the value of k. The function returns the count of such occurrences for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Problem**: The goal is to determine how many subsegments of length `m` in array `a` can have at least `k` elements that match any permutation of array `b`.

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The function `func()` processes each test case.
   - It reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the array `b`.
   - It uses sets `todo` and `done` to track which elements of `b` need to be matched and which have been matched so far.
   - It also uses a set `extra` to track elements in `a` that do not match any element in `b`.
   - For each position in `a`, it updates the sets `todo`, `done`, and `extra` as it slides through the array.
   - It counts how many times the number of matched elements (`len(done)`) is at least `k`.

3. **Check the Logic**:
   - The initial setup with sets `todo` and `done` correctly identifies the initial matching and non-matching elements.
   - The sliding window approach updates these sets correctly as it moves through the array.
   - The condition `if len(done) >= k:` correctly increments the answer when the required number of matches is achieved.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge cases where the initial segment might already meet the requirement.
   - It correctly updates the sets and checks the condition for each new element added to the window.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
   - There are no apparent errors in the logic or implementation.

Correctness: **True**
