Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
2. The given solution checks the maximum frequency of any number in the list of cards.
3. If this maximum frequency is greater than or equal to \( k \), it outputs \( k - 1 \). Otherwise, it outputs \( n \).
4. This logic is flawed because:
   - The solution only considers the maximum frequency of any single number, but it doesn't account for the possibility of having multiple numbers each with frequencies less than \( k \).
   - The solution does not consider the optimal way to reduce the total number of cards.
5. For example, in the case `7 2` with cards `[4, 2, 1, 100, 5, 2, 3]`, the maximum frequency is 2, so the solution would output 1. However, the optimal solution should be 1 since we can pair up all cards except one.
6. Another example is `6 3` with cards `[10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 40]`. The maximum frequency is 2, so the solution would output 2. But we can actually reduce it to 3 by exchanging pairs of cards.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
