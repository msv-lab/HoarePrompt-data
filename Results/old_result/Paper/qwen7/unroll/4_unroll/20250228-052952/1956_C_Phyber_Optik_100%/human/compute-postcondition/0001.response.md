State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 500**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The upper limit for `t` is given as 500, so `t` must also be less than or equal to 500.
4. No other variables or states outside the loop head (`_`) need to be adjusted since they are not mentioned and do not affect the loop's execution condition directly.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `t`, which must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
