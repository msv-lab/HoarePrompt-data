### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates a sum and prints \( n + n \) (or \( 2n \)) operations.
   - The operations are defined as setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to a specific value using permutations.

3. **Checking the Calculation:**
   - The sum calculation in the given solution is incorrect. The formula \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \) does not relate to the problem's requirements.
   - Instead, we need to maximize the sum by filling the matrix such that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( i + j - 1 \).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum, we can fill the matrix such that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( i + j - 1 \).
   - This can be achieved by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - For each row \( i \), perform a row operation to set \( a_{i, j} = i + j - 1 \).
   - For each column \( j \), perform a column operation to set \( a_{i, j} = i + j - 1 \).

6. **Evaluating the Given Code:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates the sum and does not correctly implement the required operations.
   - The operations printed do not correspond to the correct values needed to maximize the sum.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the intended behavior of the function, which is to fill the matrix with values such that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( i + j - 1 \).
   - However, the actual implementation does not match this description. The sum calculation is incorrect, and the operations performed do not achieve the desired result.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not perform the necessary operations to achieve the maximum sum.
