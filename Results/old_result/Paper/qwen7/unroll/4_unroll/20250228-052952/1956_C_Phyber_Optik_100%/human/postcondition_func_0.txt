The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). It calculates a sum based on `n` using a specific formula and prints this sum along with `n + n`. Additionally, it prints two blocks of lines, each containing `n` lines. In these blocks, the first column alternates between 1 and 2, the second column decreases from `n` to 1, and the third column is a range from 1 to `n`. This process repeats `t` times for each test case.
