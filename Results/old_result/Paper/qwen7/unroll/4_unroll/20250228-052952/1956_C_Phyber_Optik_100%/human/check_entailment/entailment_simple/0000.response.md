Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided code attempts to solve the problem by calculating a sum and printing it along with a series of operations.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
   - In the for loop, the sum is updated using the formula \( (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i \). This formula seems to be an attempt to calculate some cumulative sum, but it does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
   - The printed sum `sum` and the number of operations `n + n` do not seem to follow the problem's constraints or requirements.
   - The subsequent loops print operations of type 1 and type 2, but they do not ensure that the sum of the matrix elements is maximized. Instead, they simply assign values in a pattern that does not necessarily maximize the sum.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the maximum sum and the operations to achieve it are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
