Output State: The output consists of multiple lines for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, it prints the value of `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two blocks of lines. Each block contains `n` lines, where the first block starts with 1 and decreases to 1, and the second block starts with 2 and decreases to 2. The range of numbers printed in each line is from 1 to `n`. This process repeats for `t` times, where `t` is the input integer between 1 and 500.
