Output State: `g` is a list of lists where each element at index i (from 0 to n) contains its adjacent vertices (connected by edges), forming an undirected graph with `n` vertices. The `edges` variable contains pairs of integers representing the connections between vertices. After executing the loop, each vertex's list in `g` will include all vertices it is directly connected to.
