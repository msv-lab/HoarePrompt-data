You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    for ii in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        r = a[0]
        rem = 0
        y = 0
        for i in range(0, n - 1):
            if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
                r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
                rem = k % (i + 1)
                y = n - 1 - i
                k = 0
                break
            else:
                k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
                r = a[i + 1]
        if k != 0:
            r = a[n - 1] + k // n
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
        else:
            print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), an integer \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \). For each test case, it calculates a final value \( r \) based on the given constraints and prints the result. If \( k \) is completely consumed during the process, it calculates \( r \) using the last element of the sorted list and the remaining value of \( k \). Otherwise, it finds the maximum possible value of \( r \) by adjusting the elements of the list according to the value of \( k \) and the differences between consecutive elements. The function outputs the final calculated value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to adjust the values in the array `a` to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, the logic used to determine the value of `r` and the subsequent adjustments to `k`, `rem`, and `y` do not accurately reflect the problem requirements.

One key issue is that the program does not properly account for the distribution of card types to achieve the maximum score. For instance, consider the following input:

- Test case: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
- Initial card counts: `a = [1, 2, 3]`

The correct approach would involve distributing the additional cards (`k = 4`) to ensure that each type of card is present in a way that maximizes the number of valid subarrays. The program, however, does not handle this distribution correctly. 

For example, the program might incorrectly set `r` and `rem` without fully considering how to optimally distribute the additional cards. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the maximum score.

To illustrate, let's consider a specific case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
- Initial card counts: `a = [1, 2, 3]`

The correct solution would involve adding cards to ensure that the final configuration allows for the maximum number of valid subarrays. The program, however, fails to achieve this due to its flawed logic.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, leading to a **False** correctness verdict.
