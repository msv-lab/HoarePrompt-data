### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not solve the problem correctly. The program sorts the array in ascending order and prints it, which does not maximize the beauty of the array. To maximize the beauty, we need to strategically arrange the elements to maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array in ascending order results in a non-optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty. For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. Sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is calculated as \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 114\). However, the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`, resulting in a beauty of \((43 - 100) + (90 - 43) + (54 - 90) + (80 - 54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = -20\).

2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the beauty, we should alternate between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized while minimizing the negative differences. For example, for the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the optimal arrangement is `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]`.

3. **Implementation**: The correct approach involves:
   - Reading the input.
   - Separating the largest and smallest elements.
   - Alternating between the largest and smallest elements to form the array with the maximum beauty.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not maximize the beauty of the array by simply sorting it.
