You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each test case consists of n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers representing the array a, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all elements in the array.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        
        print(' '.join(ar))
        
    #State: After all iterations, the output will consist of the sorted versions of the input arrays, each on a new line. The integers within each sorted array will be converted to strings and printed space-separated.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to sort the array and then join the elements as strings, which does not address the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

To achieve the correct solution, the program should sort the array such that the smallest element is placed at the beginning and the largest at the end, ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. However, the current implementation simply sorts the array and prints the elements as a string, which does not reflect the intended calculation of beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
5
100 54 80 43 90
2
2 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
57
1
```

But the provided program will output:
```
1 2 3
69 69 69
2 1
```

This shows that the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the beauty of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
