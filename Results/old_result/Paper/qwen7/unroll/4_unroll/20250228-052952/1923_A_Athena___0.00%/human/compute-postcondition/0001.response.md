State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. The problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, so `t` must be within this range.
4. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) ensures that the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.
