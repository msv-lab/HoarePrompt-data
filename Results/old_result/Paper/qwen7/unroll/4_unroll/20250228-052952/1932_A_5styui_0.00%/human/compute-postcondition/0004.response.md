Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 0.

Explanation: The loop processes each character of the string `b` for each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`). If a character `@` is found, `s` is incremented. If a character `*` is found, the inner loop breaks without further processing. After processing each string `b`, `s` is printed and reset to 0 for the next iteration. Since `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, the final value of `s` will always be 0 regardless of the input strings `b`.
