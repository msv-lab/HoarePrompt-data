Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates `a` times. During each iteration, it reads an integer `d` and a string `b`. It then counts the number of '@' characters in `b`. If it encounters a '*' character, it breaks out of the inner loop. After processing each string `b`, it prints the count of '@' characters and resets `s` to 0 for the next iteration. Since `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration, the final value of `s` will always be 0 regardless of the input.
