Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data for t test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', then returns the count of cells with coins ('@') for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a string of length `n` representing a grid. The function counts the number of cells containing coins ('@') for each test case and returns these counts.
