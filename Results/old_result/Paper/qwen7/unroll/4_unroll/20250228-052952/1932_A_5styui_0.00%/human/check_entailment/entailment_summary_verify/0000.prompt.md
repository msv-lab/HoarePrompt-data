You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
During your journey through computer universes, you stumbled upon a very
interesting world. It is a path with n consecutive cells, each of which can
either be empty, contain thorns, or a coin. In one move, you can move one or
two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain
thorns (and belongs to the path). If you move to the cell with a coin, you
pick it up.

Here, green arrows correspond to legal moves, and the red arrow corresponds to
an illegal move.

You want to collect as many coins as possible. Find the maximum number of
coins you can collect in the discovered world if you start in the leftmost
cell of the path.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the length of the path.

The second line of each test case contains a string of n characters, the
description of the path. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes
a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that
the first cell is empty.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of coins you
can collect.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10
    
    .@@*@.**@@
    
    5
    
    .@@@@
    
    15
    
    .@@..@***..@@@*

Output

    3
    4
    3

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    s = 0
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        b = input()
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s = s + 1
            elif b[j] == '*':
                if b[:]:
                    break
                elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                    break
        print(s)
        s = 0



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input data for up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', then counts the number of cells with coins ('@'). The function prints the count for each test case and resets the count to 0 after processing each string. The final output consists of the count of cells with coins for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for moving along the path and collecting coins. Specifically, the program does not handle the movement constraints properly. It simply counts the number of coins in the entire string without considering the valid moves (moving one or two cells at a time and avoiding thorns).

For example, consider the input:
```
10
.@@*@.**@@
```
The correct solution would involve moving from the first cell to the third cell (collecting a coin), then to the fifth cell (collecting another coin), and finally to the seventh cell (collecting the last coin). However, the given program will simply count all the coins in the string, which results in an incorrect output of 3 instead of the correct output of 3.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the movement along the path, ensuring that it only moves one or two cells at a time and avoids thorns.
