Reasoning:

1. The problem description specifies that there will be `t` test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`. However, the annotated program does not actually read the value of `t` from the input. Instead, it assumes that there will be exactly 10 test cases, regardless of the value of `t`.

2. The program reads 10 pairs of integers from the input, but it does not handle the case where `t` is less than 10 or more than 10. This means that if `t` is not equal to 10, the program will either skip some test cases or process extra test cases, which would lead to incorrect results.

3. The logic inside the loop correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair and prints them in the required format.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the number of test cases specified by `t`.

Correctness: **False**
