### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
   - The correct approach is to set each element \(a_{i,j}\) to \(\min(i, j)\) to achieve the maximum possible sum, which is \(n^2\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case, which calculates the maximum possible sum and the required number of operations.
   - The formula \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) / 6\) is used to calculate the maximum sum, which is incorrect. The correct maximum sum is \(n^2\).
   - The solution prints \(2n\) operations, each of which permutes the elements of a row or column in descending order. This does not necessarily achieve the maximum sum.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) / 6\) does not correctly represent the maximum sum achievable by the given operations. The correct maximum sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix where each element is set to its position in the permutation (i.e., \(a_{i,j} = \min(i, j)\)) is \(n^2\).
   - The operations performed (permuting rows and columns in descending order) do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. Instead, setting each element to \(\min(i, j)\) would achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To achieve the maximum sum \(n^2\), we can set each element \(a_{i,j}\) to \(\min(i, j)\). This can be done in \(2n\) operations:
     - For each row \(i\), set the row to \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
     - For each column \(j\), set the column to \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).

5. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements. The provided program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues with the given solution. The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix elements.
