Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and n is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 1 to 500. The condition on the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not get affected by this single assignment.
