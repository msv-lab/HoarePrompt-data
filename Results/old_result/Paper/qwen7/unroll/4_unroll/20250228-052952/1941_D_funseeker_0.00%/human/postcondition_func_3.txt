The function takes four parameters: the number of players \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 1000), the number of throws \( m \) (1 ≤ \( m \) ≤ 1000), the initial player \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) ≤ \( n \)), and a set \( ans \) initialized with \( x \). For each throw, it updates the set \( ans \) based on the distance \( r \) (1 ≤ \( r \) ≤ \( n - 1 \)) and the direction \( c \) ('0', '1', or '?'). After all throws, if 0 is in \( ans \), it replaces 0 with \( n \). Finally, it prints the size of the updated set \( ans \) and the elements of \( ans \).
