#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. The list of moves consists of m tuples, each containing an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), where '0' indicates a clockwise throw, '1' indicates a counterclockwise throw, and '?' indicates an unknown direction.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The list of moves consists of m tuples, where each tuple contains an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), representing the distance and the direction of the i-th throw, respectively.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value calculated by the function `func_1()` for the given test case parameters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any direct parameters but relies on the execution of `func_1()`. It processes test case parameters including an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), integers `n`, `m`, and `x` (2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, 1 <= x <= n), and a list of `m` tuples, each containing an integer `r_i` (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character `c_i` ('0', '1', or '?'). The function ultimately returns an integer value calculated by `func_1()` based on these parameters.

For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ x ≤ n. Each of the next m lines contains an integer r_i (1 ≤ r_i ≤ n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), indicating the distance and direction of the throw, respectively.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of integers. This list is derived by first obtaining a string from `func_1()`, then splitting this string into individual elements, and finally converting each element to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?').

    #State: `ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, calculated based on the operations performed in each iteration of the loop. The set `ans` starts with the player `x` and updates in each iteration by adding new positions derived from the current set using the values of `r` and the condition specified by `c`.

        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws. If 0 is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes the integer `n`. If 0 is not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))

    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: {integer elements of ans}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four parameters: the number of players \( n \) (2 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 1000), the number of throws \( m \) (1 ≤ \( m \) ≤ 1000), the initial player \( x \) (1 ≤ \( x \) ≤ \( n \)), and a set \( ans \) initialized with \( x \). For each throw, it updates the set \( ans \) based on the distance \( r \) (1 ≤ \( r \) ≤ \( n - 1 \)) and the direction \( c \) ('0', '1', or '?'). After all throws, if 0 is in \( ans \), it replaces 0 with \( n \). Finally, it prints the size of the updated set \( ans \) and the elements of \( ans \).
