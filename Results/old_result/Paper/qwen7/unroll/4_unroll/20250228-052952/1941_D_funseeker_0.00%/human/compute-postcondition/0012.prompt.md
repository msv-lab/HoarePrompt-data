You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?').
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, calculated based on the operations performed in each iteration of the loop. The set `ans` starts with the player `x` and updates in each iteration by adding new positions derived from the current set using the values of `r` and the condition specified by `c`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws. If 0 is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes the integer `n`. If 0 is not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the set ans, which could be the original length or the original length plus one depending on whether 0 was originally in ans)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: {integer elements of ans}
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, m, x, and ans. n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. For each throw, r is an integer representing the distance of the throw (1 ≤ r ≤ n - 1), and c is a string representing the direction of the throw ('0', '1', or '?'). The function updates the set ans based on the direction of each throw and returns the final set ans.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
