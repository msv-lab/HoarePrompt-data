Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, excluding 0, and now includes the integer `n`.**

The code adds the integer `n` to the set `ans`, which was initially a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, excluding 0. After executing the line `ans.add(n)`, the set `ans` now includes all the original possible positions along with the new position `n`.
