Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose of reading input data.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function returns an integer value calculated by the function `func_1()`. Given the context, it seems this function is intended to read the number of test cases `t`. The implementation is correct as it reads an integer from standard input.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function returns a list of integers obtained by splitting a string returned by `func_1()` and converting each element to an integer. This function is correctly implemented and serves its purpose of reading the parameters `n`, `m`, and `x`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function is the core of the solution. It correctly initializes the set `ans` with the initial player `x`. It then iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on the distance `r` and the direction `c`. The logic for updating the set `ans` is correct, handling both clockwise and counterclockwise directions appropriately. The final step of replacing 0 with `n` if 0 is in `ans` is also correct. The function prints the size of the set `ans` and its elements, which matches the required output format.

Given the detailed analysis of each function and the overall logic of `func_4`, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
