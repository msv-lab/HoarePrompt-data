### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can ask queries of the form \(? a b c d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - We have at most \(3n\) queries to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and the main loop.
   - `func_1` is used to send a query and get a response.
   - `func_2` is the main function that implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\).

3. **Logic in `func_2`:**
   - The function starts by initializing `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to \(n-1\) and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{max\_item\_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\).
   - If the comparison returns `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - After finding `max_item_idx`, it initializes `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It then iterates through all indices \(i\) and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\).
   - If the comparison returns `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
   - If the comparison returns `=`, it further checks \((p_{pair\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\) and updates `pair_idx` if necessary.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_2` aims to find the indices that maximize the XOR value.
   - By comparing \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{max\_item\_idx})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\), it ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index with the highest possible OR value.
   - Then, by comparing \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_{pair\_idx})\) with \((p_{max\_item\_idx} \mid p_i)\), it finds the best possible `pair_idx` that maximizes the XOR value.
   - This approach is sound and should work as intended.

5. **Query Count:**
   - The code makes at most \(2n + 1\) queries (one for each iteration in the first loop and one for each iteration in the second loop).
   - Since \(2n + 1 \leq 3n\), the query limit is respected.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\) using at most \(3n\) queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
