To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement:

1. **pair_idx**: This variable is set to the index `i` that makes `ans1` equal to '<'. If no such `i` exists, `pair_idx` remains equal to `max_item_idx`.

2. **max_item_idx**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is used in the print statement.

Given the print statement:
```python
print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')
```

- The `!` is a literal part of the string.
- `{max_item_idx}` will be replaced with the value of `max_item_idx`.
- `{pair_idx}` will be replaced with the value of `pair_idx`.

Since `pair_idx` is either the index `i` that makes `ans1` equal to '<', or `max_item_idx` if no such `i` exists, we need to consider both cases:

- If there exists an `i` such that `ans1[i] == '<'`, then `pair_idx` will be that index `i`.
- Otherwise, `pair_idx` will be `max_item_idx`.

In either case, `max_item_idx` is a fixed value from the initial state, and `pair_idx` is determined based on the condition described.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]**
