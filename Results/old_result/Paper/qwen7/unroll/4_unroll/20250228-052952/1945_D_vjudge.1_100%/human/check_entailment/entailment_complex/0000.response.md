Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly describes the logic of the function `func_1`.
2. The function initializes a list `c` which contains the element-wise minimum of lists `a` and `b`.
3. A suffix sum list `suff` is computed, where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
4. The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity, and it iterates through the first `k` elements of `a`, calculating the value of `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updating `ans` with the minimum value found.
5. The function prints the value of `ans`, which is the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `k` people in the queue.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func_1` matches the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
