Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `n`. According to the problem description, `k` should be less than or equal to `n`, but the program does not check this condition. Specifically, the loop `for i in range(k)` will raise an `IndexError` if `k > n`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 6
1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10
```

In this case, `k` is 6, which is greater than `n` (which is 5). The program will attempt to access `a[5]` and `suff[6]`, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix this, you should add a check to ensure that `k` does not exceed `n`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    if k > n:
        return 0  # or handle this case appropriately

    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]
    ans = float('inf')
    for i in range(k):
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + suff[i + 1])
    return ans
```

With this check, the program will correctly handle cases where `k` is greater than `n`.
