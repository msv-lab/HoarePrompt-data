Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on spaces, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition 1 ≤ t ≤ 676.
