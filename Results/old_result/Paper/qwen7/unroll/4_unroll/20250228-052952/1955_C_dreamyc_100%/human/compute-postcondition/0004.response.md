Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
