Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`, `ans` is 0, `s_b` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `s_b = 0` initializes a new variable `s_b` and assigns it the value 0. The values of all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
