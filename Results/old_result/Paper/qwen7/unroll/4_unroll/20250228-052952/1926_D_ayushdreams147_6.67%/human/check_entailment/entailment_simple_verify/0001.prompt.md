You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))

    #The program returns the number of unique integers in the list 'a' after applying the bitwise operation 'num ^ (1 << 31) - 1', and 'count' is a dictionary where the keys are the results of the bitwise operation on each number in 'a', and the values are the counts of these keys, with the count decremented for numbers that appear more than once in the list.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide the given integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.
   - The key observation is that we can use the XOR operation with \(1 \ll 31 - 1\) (which is \(2^{31} - 1\)) to transform each number into a unique value that only depends on its 31 least significant bits. This transformation ensures that if two numbers have different bits in their 31 least significant bits, their transformed values will also be different.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1` which takes the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `a`.
   - It initializes `res` to 0, which will store the result (minimum number of groups).
   - A dictionary `count` is used to keep track of the occurrences of transformed values.
   - For each number `num` in the list `a`, it checks if `num` is already in `count`. If not, it transforms `num` using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and increments the count for this transformed value, incrementing `res` by 1.
   - If `num` is already in `count`, it decrements the count for `num`.

3. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` effectively isolates the 31 least significant bits of `num` and maps them to a unique value.
   - If two numbers have different bits in their 31 least significant bits, their transformed values will be different, ensuring they end up in different groups.
   - The logic correctly counts the number of unique transformed values, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles all edge cases, including when the same number appears multiple times, as it correctly increments and decrements the count.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
