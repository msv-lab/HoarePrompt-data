Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `a` and a positive integer `n` representing the number of integers in the list. It applies a bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each integer in the list, counts the unique results of this operation, and tracks the occurrences of each result. Finally, it returns the count of unique results and a dictionary containing the results of the bitwise operation as keys and their respective counts as values, with counts decremented for duplicates.**
