Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l + 1 < r`.
2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `arr`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l + 1 < r` must be true.
   - Substituting the current values, we get `0 + 1 < r`, which simplifies to `1 < r`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`. Since `l` is fixed at 0, the only variable that needs adjustment is `r`.
   - To satisfy the condition `1 < r`, `r` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `r` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 1**
