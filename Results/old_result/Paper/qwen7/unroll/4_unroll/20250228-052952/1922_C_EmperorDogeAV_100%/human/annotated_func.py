#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the function also receives a list of m queries, where each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the indices of two cities for which the minimum number of coins needed to travel from city x_i to city y_i must be calculated (1 <= x_i, y_i <= n, x_i != y_i, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5).
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i. If the next city is closer than the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the next and current city.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of city coordinates `cities` and generates a new list `prog_cities` of length `n-1`. Each element in `prog_cities` is either 1 or the absolute difference between the coordinate of the city at position `i+1` and the city at position `i` in the `cities` list. Specifically, the first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element in `prog_cities` is determined by comparing the current city with the next city in the `cities` list.
