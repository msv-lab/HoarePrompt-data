Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates an auxiliary list `prog_cities` where each element indicates whether the next city is closer than the previous one. If the next city is closer, the value is 1; otherwise, it is the absolute difference between the next and current city.
   - **Prefix Sums**: The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`). These prefix sums help in quickly calculating the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
   - **Query Handling**: For each query, the program uses the prefix sums to find the minimum cost efficiently.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes and processes the input.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the closest city for each city and constructs the `prog_cities` array.
   - The prefix sums are computed correctly and used to answer the queries efficiently.
   - The logic for handling queries is sound and ensures that the minimum cost is calculated accurately.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints and additional constraints are handled appropriately.
   - The solution accounts for the unique closest city condition and the specific query requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
