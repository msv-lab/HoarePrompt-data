### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of traveling depends on whether you choose to move directly to another city or to the closest city first.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the cost to move to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are computed using `func_1`.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively.
   - Queries are processed using these prefix sums to find the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - It returns an array where each element is either 1 (indicating moving to the next closest city) or the distance to the next city.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - The solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cost of moving from one city to another.
   - If the destination city index is greater than the source city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`. Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code assumes that the closest city is always unique, which is stated in the problem constraints.
   - The logic for determining the closest city seems correct based on the problem statement.
   - The use of prefix sums is appropriate for efficient query processing.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The constraints and additional constraints are respected.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The function `func_1` is intended to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly sets the value to 1 if the next city is closer, instead of setting it to the distance to the next city. This leads to incorrect results in the prefix sums and ultimately incorrect answers for the queries.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
  ```python
  if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
      prog_cities[i] = 1
  else:
      prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
  ```
  This logic should be:
  ```python
  if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
      prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
  else:
      prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
  ```

- **Impact on Prefix Sums**:
  - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are computed based on the incorrect values in `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.
  - These incorrect values lead to incorrect cumulative sums, resulting in wrong answers for the queries.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` incorrectly determines the closest city, leading to incorrect results in the prefix sums and ultimately incorrect answers for the queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
