Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(n - 1)` generates values from 0 to `n-2`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `n`**: The variable `n` is given as a positive integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^5`.

4. **Ensure the Loop Can Execute**: For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1 (since `range(n - 1)` will generate values from 0 to `n-2`). This means `n` must be at least 2.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial state of `n` and `i` to ensure the loop can execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be 0 (the starting value for the loop).
- `n` must be at least 2 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:

**State: **`total` is not specified, `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 filled with zeros, `i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
