### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost depends on whether you move directly to another city or to the closest city first.
   - The closest city for each city is defined as the city with the smallest distance to the current city among all other cities.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` computes an array where each element represents the cost to move to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are computed using `func_1`.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively.
   - Queries are processed using these prefix sums to find the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - It returns an array where each element is either 1 (indicating moving to the next closest city) or the distance to the next city.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. Instead, it incorrectly sets the value to 1 if the next city is closer than the previous city, which is not the intended logic.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - The solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cost of moving from one city to another.
   - If the destination city index is greater than the source city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`. Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.
   - This part of the solution is correct as long as `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are correctly computed.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic in `func_1` for determining the closest city is flawed. The function should compare the distance to the next city with the distance to the previous city, but it incorrectly sets the value to 1 if the next city is closer.
   - For example, consider the cities `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. According to the problem statement, the closest city to city 2 is city 3, but the function would incorrectly set the value to 1 because the next city (city 3) is closer than the previous city (city 1).

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem statement is not correctly handled by the code due to the flaw in `func_1`.
   - The constraints and additional constraints are respected, but the logic for identifying the closest city is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. Therefore, the prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are based on incorrect data, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
