Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order. `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city and its next city. If moving forward to the next city is closer than moving backward to the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city.
