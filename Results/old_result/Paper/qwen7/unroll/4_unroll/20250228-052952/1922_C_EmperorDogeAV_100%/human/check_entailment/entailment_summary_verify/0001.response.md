### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of traveling depends on whether you choose to move directly to another city or to the closest city first.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the cost to move to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are computed using `func_1`.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively.
   - Queries are processed using these prefix sums to find the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - It returns an array where each element is either 1 (indicating moving to the next closest city) or the distance to the next city.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - The solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cost of moving from one city to another.
   - If the destination city index is greater than the source city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`. Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code assumes that the closest city is always unique, which is stated in the problem constraints.
   - The logic for determining the closest city seems correct based on the problem statement.
   - The use of prefix sums is appropriate for efficient query processing.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The constraints and additional constraints are respected.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. The function `func_1` is intended to determine the cost to move to the next closest city, but it incorrectly calculates this cost. Specifically, the function should determine the closest city based on the minimum distance to either the previous or the next city, and set the value in `prog_cities` accordingly. Instead, the function sets the value to 1 if the next city is closer, or the distance to the next city otherwise. This means that the function does not correctly identify the closest city.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem statement: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. The closest city to each city is as follows:
- City 1 (at 0): closest city is 2 (at 8).
- City 2 (at 8): closest city is 3 (at 12).
- City 3 (at 12): closest city is 4 (at 20).
- City 4 (at 15): closest city is 3 (at 12).
- City 5 (at 20): closest city is 4 (at 15).

The function `func_1` should produce the following `prog_cities` array:
- `[8, 4, 8, 3]`

But instead, the function produces:
- `[8, 4, 8, 5]`

This discrepancy indicates that the function is not correctly identifying the closest city.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
