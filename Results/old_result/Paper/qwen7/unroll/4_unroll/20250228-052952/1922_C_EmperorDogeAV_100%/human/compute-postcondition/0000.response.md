Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `prog_cities` of length `n-1` with all elements set to 0. This does not affect the `cities` list or the value of `n`. Therefore, the `cities` list remains unchanged, and `prog_cities` is created as specified.
