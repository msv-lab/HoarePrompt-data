You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i. If the next city is closer than the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the next and current city.

    #`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i in the list `cities`. The first element is 1 if the second city is closer than the first city, otherwise it is the absolute difference between the first and second city. Each subsequent element follows the same rule comparing the current city with the next city.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line. The cost of traveling depends on whether you choose to move directly to another city or to the closest city first.

2. **Key Components of the Solution**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to compute an array where each element represents the cost to move to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are computed using `func_1`.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`, respectively.
   - Queries are processed using these prefix sums to find the minimum cost.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly identifies the closest city for each city by comparing distances to the previous and next city.
   - It returns an array where each element is either 1 (indicating moving to the next closest city) or the distance to the next city.

4. **Processing Queries**:
   - The solution uses prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cost of moving from one city to another.
   - If the destination city index is greater than the source city index, it uses `pref_sum_f`. Otherwise, it uses `pref_sum_b`.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code assumes that the closest city is always unique, which is stated in the problem constraints.
   - The logic for determining the closest city seems correct based on the problem statement.
   - The use of prefix sums is appropriate for efficient query processing.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided example in the problem statement is correctly handled by the code.
   - The constraints and additional constraints are respected.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and constraints.
