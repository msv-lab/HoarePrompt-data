You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either "1" or "n - 1", where "n" and "k" are integers provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if "k" is greater than or equal to "n - 1", the line will contain "1"; otherwise, it will contain "n - 1". The number of lines will be equal to the value of "t".



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 0 \)
     - Since no bridges can be destroyed, all islands are reachable.
     - Expected output: 2 (both islands are reachable).
   - **Case 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - One bridge can be destroyed, preventing access to one island.
     - Expected output: 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - **Case 3**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 1 \)
     - One bridge can be destroyed, but it's not enough to isolate more than one island.
     - Expected output: 4 (all islands are reachable).
   - **Case 4**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 10 \)
     - Since \( k \geq \frac{n \cdot (n-1)}{2} \), all bridges can be destroyed, isolating island 1.
     - Expected output: 1 (only island 1 is reachable).
   - **Case 5**: \( n = 5 \), \( k = 3 \)
     - Three bridges can be destroyed, but not enough to isolate all islands except 1.
     - Expected output: 5 (all islands are reachable).
   - **Case 6**: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 4 \)
     - All bridges can be destroyed, isolating island 1.
     - Expected output: 1 (only island 1 is reachable).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints 1 (isolating island 1).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \) (all other islands are reachable).

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic correctly handles the condition where `k` is large enough to isolate island 1.
   - The logic also correctly handles the case where `k` is insufficient to isolate all but one island.

Given the analysis and verification, the provided program correctly implements the solution.
