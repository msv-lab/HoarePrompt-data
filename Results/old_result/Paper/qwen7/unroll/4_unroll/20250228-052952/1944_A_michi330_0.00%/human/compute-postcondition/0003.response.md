Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either "1" or "n - 1", where "n" and "k" are integers provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if "k" is greater than or equal to "n - 1", the line will contain "1"; otherwise, it will contain "n - 1". The number of lines will be equal to the value of "t".
