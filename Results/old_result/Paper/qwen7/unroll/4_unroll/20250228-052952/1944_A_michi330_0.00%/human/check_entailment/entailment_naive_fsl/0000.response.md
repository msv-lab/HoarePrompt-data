Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than just island 1. Specifically, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can visit all islands except those that would be isolated by the bridge destruction.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 1`. In this scenario, the program incorrectly outputs `3` (i.e., `n - 1`), but the correct output should be `4` because destroying one bridge (e.g., between islands 1 and 2) does not isolate any island from Everule. Therefore, Everule can still visit all four islands.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that if `k < n-1`, the output should be `n`.
