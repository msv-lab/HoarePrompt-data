You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())

    j = 0

            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `j` is equal to `m`, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `k` is equal to the number of characters in `a` that are present in `b` up to index `m-1`.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (the number of characters in `a` that are present in `b` up to index `m-1`)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads three lines of input.
   - The first line contains two integers \( n \) and \( m \), which represent the lengths of strings \( a \) and \( b \) respectively.
   - The second line reads the binary string \( a \).
   - The third line reads the binary string \( b \).

2. **Initialization**:
   - Two variables are initialized: \( k \) (to store the result) and \( j \) (to traverse through string \( b \)).
   - \( k \) starts at 0, and \( j \) starts at 0.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - A loop runs from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = n-1 \). For each character in \( a \):
     - A nested `while` loop checks if the current character \( a[i] \) is found in \( b \) starting from index \( j \).
     - If the character \( a[i] \) is found, it increments \( k \) and moves \( j \) to the next position in \( b \).
     - If the character \( a[i] \) is not found, the loop breaks, and the search stops.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop completes, the value of \( k \) is printed, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of \( a \) that forms a subsequence of \( b \).

### Correctness Check:

1. **Logic for Finding Subsequence**:
   - The logic correctly checks each character of \( a \) to see if it appears in \( b \) in order.
   - It updates \( k \) only when a matching character is found, ensuring the longest prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \) is tracked.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where \( a \) might be a subsequence of \( b \) entirely (e.g., "100" in "1110").
   - It also handles cases where no common prefix exists (e.g., "100" in "011").

3. **Performance**:
   - The program iterates through each character of \( a \) and \( b \) once, making it efficient with a time complexity of \( O(n + m) \).

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix of \( a \) that is a subsequence of \( b \). There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
