Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an input integer, m is an input integer, a is an input string.**

The code `a = input()` assigns the value of the user's input (as a string) to the variable `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state.
