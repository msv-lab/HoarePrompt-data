Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) for each t, and two binary strings a and b (lengths n and m respectively). The function returns nothing directly but processes and operates on the provided data for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters and additional data (binary strings). It processes these inputs without returning any explicit output, focusing instead on performing operations defined within the function body based on the given constraints.
