Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a string input by the user**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` takes a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
