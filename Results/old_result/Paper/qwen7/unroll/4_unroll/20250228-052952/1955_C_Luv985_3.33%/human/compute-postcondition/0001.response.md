Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `T` after the code execution. No other variables are modified, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
