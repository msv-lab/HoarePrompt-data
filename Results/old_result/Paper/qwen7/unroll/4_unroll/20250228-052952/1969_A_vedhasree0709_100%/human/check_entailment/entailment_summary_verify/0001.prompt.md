You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            p = l[i]
            q = l[p - 1]
            if q == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n and p_i ≠ i. For each test case, the function checks if there exists an index `i` where `p[i]` is equal to `i + 1`. If such an index is found, the function prints `2`; otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. A friend comes to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive invitations.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list `l` which contains the best friends' indices.
   - It uses two variables `i` and `j` where `i` is used to iterate through the list and `j` is used to check if any pair of friends who are each other's best friends are found.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current friend `i` and their best friend `q` (which is `l[i]`) are each other's best friends (i.e., `q == i + 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to break out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found after checking all friends, it prints `3`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The logic for checking if a pair of friends who are each other's best friends is flawed. The condition `q == i + 1` does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. Instead, it should check if `q == i` and `i == l[q-1]`.
   - The code assumes that if such a pair is found, only 2 invitations are needed, but this might not be the optimal solution. For example, in the third test case, both friends need to be invited, but the code incorrectly prints `2`.
   - The code does not handle the case where no such pair exists and the minimum number of invitations required is more than 2.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To find the minimum number of invitations, we need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle involving at least 2 friends, we can invite all friends in that cycle with just 2 invitations.
   - If there are multiple cycles, we need to invite friends from different cycles to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The minimum number of invitations required would be the size of the smallest cycle plus 1 (to cover at least 2 friends).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**
