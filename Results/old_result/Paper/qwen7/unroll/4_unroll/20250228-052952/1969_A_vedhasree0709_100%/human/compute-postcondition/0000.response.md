Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the input values. It is typically not meaningful in terms of state adjustment since it is just a dummy variable.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there is input available from `input()`. Since `_` is a dummy variable, the actual condition for the loop to continue is based on the availability of input.

3. **Adjust the state**: Given that the loop will execute as long as there is input, we need to ensure that there is at least one input available. The initial state provides information about `t`, but it does not directly indicate the availability of input.

4. **Conclusion**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that there is at least one input available from `input()`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is related to the availability of input.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and there must be at least one input available from `input()`**
