Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it tries to find the smallest missing number in the array `arr` using a counter to keep track of the frequency of each number. This approach does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob nor the optimal strategy they would follow.

To illustrate why this program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program simply finds the smallest number that is not present in the array, without considering the turns and the optimal strategy. In the optimal game, Alice and Bob would strategically pick numbers to maximize or minimize the MEX value, respectively. The provided solution does not account for these strategic moves.
