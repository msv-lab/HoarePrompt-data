Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally.
2. The provided solution attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the array `arr`, but it does not correctly simulate the game rules or account for the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
3. Alice can always pick elements to ensure that the smallest missing integer is maximized, while Bob will try to minimize it.
4. The logic in the provided code does not consider the turns of Alice and Bob or their respective strategies. It simply finds the smallest missing integer in the array without considering the game dynamics.
5. To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game and ensure that Alice and Bob make optimal moves according to their objectives.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the optimal strategies of the players. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
