Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Removals and Negations**: The logic for handling the removals and negations is flawed. Specifically, the way `ans1` and `ans2` are updated does not correctly reflect the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Fully Implemented**: The current implementation does not fully consider the optimal strategy where Alice and Bob make their moves. For example, Alice should remove the smallest elements first, and Bob should negate the smallest positive elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Logic for Updating `ans1` and `ans2`**: The logic for updating `ans1` and `ans2` does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of both players. It seems to mix up the roles of Alice and Bob and does not handle the constraints properly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array in ascending order
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate the initial sum
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        for i in range(k):
            total_sum -= a[i]
        
        # Bob negates the smallest x elements
        for i in range(x):
            if a[i] > 0:
                total_sum -= 2 * a[i]
        
        # If there are remaining elements after Alice's removal, Bob can negate them
        if k < n:
            for i in range(k, n):
                if a[i] > 0:
                    total_sum -= 2 * a[i]
        
        print(total_sum)


# Example usage:
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that Alice removes the smallest elements first and Bob negates the smallest positive elements to minimize the sum, following the optimal strategy.
