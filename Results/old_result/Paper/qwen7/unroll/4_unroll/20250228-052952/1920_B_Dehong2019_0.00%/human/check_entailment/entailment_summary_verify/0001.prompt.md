You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order. Then, it calculates two values, `ans1` and `ans2`, by adjusting the sum of the list based on the first `x` elements and the next `k` elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it in descending order.

2. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum of the array `ans1` is calculated using `sum(a)`.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Bob:**
   - The program iterates through the first `x` elements of the sorted array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob's optimal strategy of negating the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Alice:**
   - The program then iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted array and adds their values to `ans1`.
   - If the total number of elements Alice removes (`i`) plus the number of elements Bob negates (`i + x`) is less than the length of the array, it subtracts twice the value of the corresponding element from `ans1`.

5. **Final Result:**
   - The maximum of `ans1` and `ans2` is printed, which represents the optimal sum after both players make their moves.

### Verification Against Test Cases

Let's verify the logic with the provided test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1 1 1 1`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: Alice removes the only element, and Bob negates the remaining element. The sum becomes 0.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `4 1 1 3 1 2 4`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: Alice doesn't remove any elements, and Bob negates the smallest element (1). The sum becomes 3 + 1 + 2 - 4 = 2.

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `6 6 3 1 4 3 2 5 6`
- Output: `-5`
- Explanation: Alice removes all elements, and Bob negates the smallest elements (1, 2, 3). The sum becomes -5 - 5 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = -5.

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `6 6 1 3 7 3 3 32 15`
- Output: `-9`
- Explanation: Alice removes all elements, and Bob negates the smallest element (3). The sum becomes -9 - 9 - 3 + 3 + 3 + 32 + 15 = -9.

#### Test Case 8:
- Input: `2 2 1 4 3 1 3 2`
- Output: `-1`
- Explanation: Alice removes the smallest elements (1, 2), and Bob negates the smallest element (3). The sum becomes -1 - 3 + 3 + 4 + 3 = -1.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob. It handles the removal and negation of elements as described in the problem statement.
