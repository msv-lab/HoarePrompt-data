Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where the first two elements (index 0 and index 1) are set to False, and all other elements are set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0.**

Explanation: The code sets the first two elements of the `prime` list to `False`. All other elements remain `True` as per the initial state. The lengths and initial values of the `Highest_Prime` and `Lowest_Prime` lists remain unchanged.
