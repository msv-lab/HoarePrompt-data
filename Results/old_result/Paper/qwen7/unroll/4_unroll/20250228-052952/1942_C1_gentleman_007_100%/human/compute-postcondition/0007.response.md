Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `l`, which is a 2D list. It returns a 2D list `p` of dimensions (n+1) x (m+1), where each element `p[i][j]` is calculated as the sum of the top (`p[i-1][j]`), left (`p[i][j-1]`), and the top-left diagonal element (`p[i-1][j-1]`) minus the top-left diagonal element of the previous step (`p[i-1][j-1]`). The first row and first column of `p` are all zeros.**
