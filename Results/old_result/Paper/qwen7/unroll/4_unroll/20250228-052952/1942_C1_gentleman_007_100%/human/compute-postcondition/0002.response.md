Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `Lowest_Prime` as a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0. This means that each element in the `Lowest_Prime` list is now 0. The values of `num`, `prime`, and `Highest_Prime` remain unchanged from their initial state.
