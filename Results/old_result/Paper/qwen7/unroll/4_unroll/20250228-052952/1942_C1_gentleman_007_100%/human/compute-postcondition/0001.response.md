Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0.**

The code initializes `Highest_Prime` as a list of length `num + 1` with all elements set to 0. This does not affect the values of `num` or the `prime` list, so those remain unchanged.
