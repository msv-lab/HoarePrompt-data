Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Let's consider the following case:

- Input: `1 1 2`
- Expected Output: `2`

According to the problem description, if the scores are `1, 1, 2`, the only way to achieve these scores is through two draws (one draw between the first and second player, and another draw between the first and third player). However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.

Here’s a breakdown of the issue:
- The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. This condition is not relevant to determining the maximum number of draws.
- The program then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is incorrect because it doesn’t account for the possibility of draws.
- The subsequent while loop attempts to find a valid combination of wins and draws, but it does not correctly handle all scenarios, especially when the scores indicate multiple draws.

Given the example input `1 1 2`, the program should output `2` (two draws), but it does not do so. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
