### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Initial Check for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it directly prints `p1 + p2`, which is not necessarily correct. This condition should be checked more carefully to ensure the scores are achievable through valid games.

4. **Detailed Calculation**:
   - The program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. It iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` where `x` represents the number of draws involving the first and second players, and `y` represents the number of draws involving the first and third players.
   - The logic inside the loop ensures that the scores are consistent with the number of draws. However, the current implementation might not cover all edge cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For instance, it does not account for the possibility that the scores might not be achievable due to the constraints of the game rules.
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current approach does not guarantee the maximum number of draws.

### Conclusion:

The given program has logical flaws and does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
