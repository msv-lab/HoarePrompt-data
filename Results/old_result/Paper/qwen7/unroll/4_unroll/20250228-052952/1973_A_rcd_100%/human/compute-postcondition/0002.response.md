Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is odd, \(-1\) will be printed. Otherwise, if \(p3\) is greater than or equal to \(p1 + p2\), \(p1 + p2\) will be printed. If \(p3\) is less than \(p1 + p2\), the loop will attempt to find values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(p1 - x + p3\) is the smallest possible value greater than or equal to \(p3\) and will print this value when a valid pair is found. If no valid pair is found, \(p3\) will be printed.
