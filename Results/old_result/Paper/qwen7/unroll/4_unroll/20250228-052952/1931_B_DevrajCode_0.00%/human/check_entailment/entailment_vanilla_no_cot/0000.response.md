Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into a list. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.

3. **Checking Divisibility**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No' because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly.

4. **Calculating Target Amount**: If the total water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).

5. **Checking Feasibility**: It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the difference between the current amount and the target amount. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the target, so it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.
