### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to check if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
- The total amount of water must be divisible by the number of containers.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   input = sys.stdin.read
   data = input().split()
   n = int(data[0])
   a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
   print(func_1(n, a))
   ```
   - This part reads the input and splits it into a list of integers.
   - The first element of the list is the number of containers (`n`), and the rest are the amounts of water in each container.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n, a):
       total_water = sum(a)
       if total_water % n != 0:
           return 'No'
       target = total_water // n
       container = 0
       for water in a:
           container += water - target
           if container < 0:
               return 'No'
       return 'Yes'
   ```
   - **Total Water Divisibility Check:** 
     - `total_water = sum(a)` calculates the total amount of water.
     - `if total_water % n != 0:` checks if the total water is divisible by `n`. If not, it returns `'No'`.
   - **Target Water Calculation:**
     - `target = total_water // n` calculates the target amount of water each container should have.
   - **Balance Check:**
     - `container = 0` initializes a variable to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target.
     - `for water in a:` iterates through each container.
     - `container += water - target` updates the cumulative difference.
     - `if container < 0:` checks if the cumulative difference becomes negative. If so, it returns `'No'`.
     - If the loop completes without returning `'No'`, it returns `'Yes'`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function checks if the total water is divisible by `n`.
- If not, it returns `'No'`.
- If the total water is divisible, it checks if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target remains non-negative.
- If the cumulative difference becomes negative at any point, it returns `'No'`.
- If the loop completes without issues, it returns `'Yes'`.

#### Validation:
- **Divisibility Check:** The program correctly checks if the total water is divisible by `n`.
- **Cumulative Difference Check:** The program correctly tracks the cumulative difference and ensures it does not become negative.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the total water is not divisible by `n`, the program correctly returns `'No'`.
  - If the total water is divisible, the program correctly checks if the water can be evenly distributed without any negative cumulative differences.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and the function summary. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
