Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the program's logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n, a)` performs the necessary calculations:
   - It computes the total amount of water `total_water`.
   - It checks if `total_water` is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container, which is `total_water // n`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and accumulates the difference between each container's water amount and the target amount in the variable `container`.
     - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'No'.
   - The program ensures that the distribution process does not lead to a negative amount of water in any container by checking `container` at each step.

4. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, so the initial check `total_water % n != 0` is sufficient to handle this edge case.
   - The program correctly handles the distribution process and ensures that the water can be evenly distributed if and only if the conditions are met.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
