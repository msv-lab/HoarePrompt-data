### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - The program correctly parses the number of containers `n` and the list of water units `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n` (number of containers) and `a` (list of water units in each container).
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - If the total water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container's water amount and keeps track of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount in the variable `container`.
   - The purpose of the variable `container` is to ensure that no container ends up with less water than the average. If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water across all containers, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it returns 'Yes', indicating the water can be evenly distributed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'No' immediately.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` and checks if it's possible to balance the water.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the required format.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers. The use of the `container` variable ensures that the water balance check is performed correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
