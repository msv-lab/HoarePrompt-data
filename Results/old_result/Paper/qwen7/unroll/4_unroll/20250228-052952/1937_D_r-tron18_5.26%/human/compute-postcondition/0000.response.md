Output State: **`pre` is a list of integers where each integer is (i + 1) for every index `i` where `s1[i]` is '>', `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is an integer representing the length of the string `s1`, and `t` is the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5 and for each test case 1 ≤ n ≤ 5 × 10^5.**

The code creates a list comprehension that iterates over the indices of `s1`. For each index `i` where the character at that index is '>', it calculates `(i + 1)` and adds it to the list `pre`. The values of `s1`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
