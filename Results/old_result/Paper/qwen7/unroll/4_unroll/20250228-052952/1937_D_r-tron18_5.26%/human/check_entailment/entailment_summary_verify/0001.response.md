### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. However, upon closer inspection, there are several issues with the implementation that make the code incorrect.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Time:**
   - The logic in `func_2` for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Specifically, the formulas used to compute `zeroInd` and `oneInd` do not accurately reflect the movement of the pinball.
   - For example, the formula `zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)` and similar ones do not correctly account for the toggling of directions and the movement of the pinball.

2. **Misuse of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to serve its intended purpose. It is used to calculate some values, but these calculations are not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a value based on the accumulated values, but the way it is used in `func_2` does not match the expected behavior.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Directions:**
   - The logic for handling the directions and updating the cumulative sums and suffix sums is not correctly implemented. The pinball should move according to the current direction and toggle it after each move, but the current implementation does not correctly simulate this behavior.

4. **Backward Iteration Issue:**
   - While the backward iteration through the string `s1` is a good approach to ensure the pinball's path is correctly traced, the specific calculations within the loop do not correctly reflect the movement and toggling of directions.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided code contains significant logical errors and does not correctly simulate the movement and toggling of the pinball according to the problem statement.
