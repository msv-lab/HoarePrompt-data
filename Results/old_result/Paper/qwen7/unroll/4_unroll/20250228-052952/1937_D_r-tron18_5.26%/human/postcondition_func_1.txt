The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and stores the result of certain conditions related to the characters in `s1` into a list `ans`. After processing, it prints the contents of `ans`. The final state of the program includes the `ans` list containing integers that represent the calculated values based on the input string `s1` and its length `n`.
