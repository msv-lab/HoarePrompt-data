Output State: **`suffZero` is [0], `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list containing `n` zeros by using the expression `[0] * n`. The initial state of `suffZero` remains unchanged as [0]. The value of `n` is not specified in the initial state, so it is represented as a variable `n` in the output state.
