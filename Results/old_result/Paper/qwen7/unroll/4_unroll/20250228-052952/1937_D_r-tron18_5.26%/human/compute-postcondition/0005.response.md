Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n - 1, -1, -1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `n - 1`. This means `i` will start from `n - 1` and decrement by 1 until it reaches -1.

3. **Determine the required state of `n`**: Since `i` starts at `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. If `n` were 0 or less, `i` would never be initialized correctly, and the loop would not start.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`suffZero` and `ans`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (so that `i` can start from `n - 1`).
- `i` should be initialized to `n - 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`suffZero` is [0], `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`**.
