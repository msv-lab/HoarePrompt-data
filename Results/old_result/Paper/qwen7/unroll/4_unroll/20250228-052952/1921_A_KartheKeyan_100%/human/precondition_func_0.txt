The function takes no input arguments. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t (1 \le t \le 100) such testcases.
