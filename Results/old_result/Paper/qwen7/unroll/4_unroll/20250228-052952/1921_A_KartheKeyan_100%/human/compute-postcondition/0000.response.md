Output State: **n is an input integer, and the value of s is calculated as (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2 for each testcase, and printed for each iteration of the while loop.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`. This value of `s` is then printed. After processing all test cases, `n` is decremented by 1. The initial state of `n` is an input integer, and the value of `s` is calculated and printed for each test case. The other variables (`l` and `s`) are only used within the loop and their final values are not specified in the output state.
