Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`. The function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to read all input from standard input at once.**

This line of code does not change the values of the variables but rather changes how input is handled. Instead of reading input line by line, `sys.stdin.read` reads all the input at once as a single string. All other conditions and constraints on the variables remain the same.
