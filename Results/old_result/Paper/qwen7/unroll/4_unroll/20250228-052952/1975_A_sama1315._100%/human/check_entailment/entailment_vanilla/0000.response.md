Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be rearranged into a non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. **Logic**:
   - It first sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then concatenates `a` with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - It iterates through all possible splits of `concatenated_a` and checks if any split matches `sorted_a`.

**Issues with `func_1`**:
- **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array. Instead, it checks if the entire array `a` plus itself contains a subarray that is sorted. This is not equivalent to checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
- **Example Counterexample**: Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. Sorting this gives `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Concatenating `a` with itself gives `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. However, there is no way to split this concatenated array to get `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]` as a subarray. Therefore, `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` for this case.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Purpose**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Logic**:
   - It reads the input data and processes it to extract the number of test cases, the size of each array, and the elements of each array.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.

**Issues with `func_2`**:
- **Correct Logic**: The logic in `func_2` is correct in terms of reading input and calling `func_1`. However, since `func_1` has issues, the overall solution will still be incorrect.

### Conclusion
Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic, the program as a whole is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
