### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with `func_1`. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code to ensure our understanding is accurate.

#### Problem Revisited
The goal is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. The original assessment correctly points out that the current implementation in `func_1` does not achieve this. Specifically, the function checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array, which is not the correct approach.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Current Logic**: The function checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array. This is incorrect because it does not simulate the actual operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array.
   - **Example Counterexample**: Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. Sorting this gives `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Concatenating `a` with itself gives `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4, 1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. There is no way to split this concatenated array to get `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]` as a subarray. Therefore, `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` for this case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: Correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Calling `func_1`**: Calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - **Overall Logic**: While the logic for reading and processing input is correct, the correctness of the program depends on `func_1`.

Given that `func_1` is fundamentally flawed, the overall program is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

**Final: False**
