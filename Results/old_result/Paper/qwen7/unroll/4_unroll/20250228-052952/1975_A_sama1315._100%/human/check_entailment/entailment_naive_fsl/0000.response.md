Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts, but it does not actually perform the necessary checks to determine if such a split exists. Instead, it tries to find a subarray in the concatenated array that matches the sorted version of the original array, which is not a valid approach for this problem.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
No
```

However, the current implementation would incorrectly output "Yes" because it checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array, which is not the correct logic for determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.
