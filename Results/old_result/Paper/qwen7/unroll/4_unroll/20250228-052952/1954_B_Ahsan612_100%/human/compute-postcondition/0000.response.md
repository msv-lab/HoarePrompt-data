Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder and is typically ignored in the loop body since it is not referenced.

2. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - Since `_` is just a placeholder, no specific state adjustment is needed for this variable.
   - The key information we need to ensure the loop can execute is the value of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop:**
   - We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the input to `int(input())` will be within this range.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input to `int(input())` is a valid integer within the specified range.

4. **Formulate the State:**
   - Since the loop will execute based on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is a valid integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`int(input())` must be an integer within the range 1 to 10^4**
