Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the given code is flawed and does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements to remove for the array to stop being beautiful. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Minimum Removals**:
   - The code attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where the elements are the same but does not consider the requirement to remove elements to break the "beautiful" property.
   - It only counts consecutive segments of the same element and finds the minimum segment length, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum removals needed.

2. **Misunderstanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires removing elements to ensure no two adjacent elements are equal (i.e., no `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` for any `i`).
   - The current implementation does not account for this condition properly.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code fails to handle edge cases where the array is already non-beautiful or where the minimum removals need to be calculated based on the structure of the array rather than just counting consecutive segments.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to identify the longest subsequence that maintains the "beautiful" property and then calculate the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subsequence. Here is a revised approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest subsequence that maintains the "beautiful" property
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        prev = ar[0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] != prev:
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1
            else:
                current_length += 1
            prev = ar[i]
        
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of elements to remove
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

func()
```

This approach correctly identifies the longest subsequence that maintains the "beautiful" property and calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break this subsequence, ensuring the solution meets the problem requirements.
