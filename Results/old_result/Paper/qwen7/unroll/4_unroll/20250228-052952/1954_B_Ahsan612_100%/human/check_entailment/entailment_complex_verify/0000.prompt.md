You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf or minn == len(ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable `minn` is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If there are no such segments or the array is uniform, `minn` is set to -1. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then finds the minimum length of any segment in the list where the elements are the same. If no such segment exists or the list is uniform, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest such segment.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array has alternating elements, which can still be considered beautiful according to the problem description. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. According to the problem, this array is beautiful because you can choose `i = 2` and replace `a_2` with `a_1`, making the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1]`, and then choose `i = 4` and replace `a_4` with `a_3`, making the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, suggesting that only one element needs to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. This is incorrect because removing just one element (`1` at index `1` or `3`) would not prevent the array from being beautiful, as you could still perform the necessary operations to make all elements the same.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly identify and handle such alternating patterns in the array.
