The function does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it relies on the internal call to `func_1()` to process three parameters: `n` (an integer between 1 and 200,000), `x` (an integer between 1 and `n`), and `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`). After processing these parameters, it returns a list generated by `func_1()`.
