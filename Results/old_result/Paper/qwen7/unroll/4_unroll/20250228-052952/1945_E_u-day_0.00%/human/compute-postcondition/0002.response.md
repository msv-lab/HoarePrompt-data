Output State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

The code simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `pos`. No other changes are made to the values of `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
