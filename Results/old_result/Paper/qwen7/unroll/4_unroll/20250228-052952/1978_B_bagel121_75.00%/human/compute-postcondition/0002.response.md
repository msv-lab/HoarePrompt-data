Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each representing the result of one iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the usual price of a bun (a) is greater than or equal to the modified price of the first bun (b), it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of buns sold at the modified price (`k`), computes the total cost for these buns using the arithmetic series sum formula, and then adds the cost of the remaining buns sold at the usual price (`p2`). The final output will be the sum of these two values for each test case.
