Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function processes `t` and `n` and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n` within specified ranges, and it processes these values according to some unspecified logic. The overall constraint on the sum of `n^2` ensures that the function can efficiently manage the number of test cases and their associated values.
