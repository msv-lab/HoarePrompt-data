Output State: t test cases are printed, each followed by two lines of output. For each test case:
1. A line with two numbers: the first number is the sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \), and the second number is \( 2n \).
2. n lines, each starting with '1 n', followed by the sequence from 1 to n.
3. n lines, each starting with '2 n', followed by the sequence from 1 to n.

The value of \( n \) for each test case is determined by user input, and the process is repeated for each test case specified by the first input.
