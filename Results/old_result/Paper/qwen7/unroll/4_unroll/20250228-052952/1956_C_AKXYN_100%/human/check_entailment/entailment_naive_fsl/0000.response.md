Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. According to the problem description, the goal is to fill the matrix such that the sum of all elements is maximized using no more than 2n operations. However, the program attempts to fill the matrix with a triangular pattern, which does not necessarily maximize the sum.

For example, consider a 2x2 matrix. The program will output:
```
4 4
1 1 2
1 2 1
2 1 2
2 2 1
```
This results in the matrix:
```
[1, 2]
[2, 1]
```
The sum of this matrix is 6, but the maximum possible sum for a 2x2 matrix is 8, which can be achieved by setting the matrix to:
```
[2, 2]
[2, 2]
```
Thus, the program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all cases.
