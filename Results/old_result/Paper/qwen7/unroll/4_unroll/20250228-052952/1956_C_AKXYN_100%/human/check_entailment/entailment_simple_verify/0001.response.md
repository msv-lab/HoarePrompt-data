### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i, j} \) can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \) using two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the entire \( i \)-th row.
     - Type 2: Permute the entire \( j \)-th column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \).
   - The solution prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - Two operations are performed for each row from \( n \) to 1:
     - A Type 1 operation to permute the row.
     - A Type 2 operation to permute the corresponding column.

3. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \) does not represent the maximum possible sum for the matrix. Instead, the maximum sum is achieved by setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( i + j \).
   - The operations are correctly described and executed. Each row and column is permuted in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with values from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - The solution ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

5. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the maximum sum is achieved by setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( i + j \). This results in the sum:
     \[
     \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (i + j) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} i + \sum_{j=1}^{n} j \right) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( ni + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right) = n \sum_{i=1}^{n} i + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 = n \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \cdot n = n^2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} + n^2 \cdot \frac{n+1}{2} = n^2 (n+1)
     \]
   - The provided sum formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \) does not match this result.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given solution calculates the sum incorrectly. While the operations are correctly described and executed, the sum calculation is flawed.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given solution is incorrect because the sum calculation is wrong. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n^2 (n+1) \), not the sum calculated by the provided formula.
