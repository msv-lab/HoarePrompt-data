You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function interacts with an external entity (the interactor) through standard input and output. The interactor provides the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the size of the permutation and the results of the queries. The function must manage up to 3n queries for each test case and handle the responses accordingly.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
            elif r == '=':
                print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                r2 = input('')
                if r2 == '<':
                    prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after all iterations, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after all iterations. These values are determined based on the comparisons made within the loop and the responses received from the input.
    #
    #In the loop, `v1` is updated when the response to the query is '<', and `prev` is updated when the response to the query is '>'. If the response is '=', a further check is made to ensure `prev` is updated correctly. The final output is '! prev v1'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It manages interactions with an external interactor through standard input and output. The interactor provides the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the size of the permutation and the results of the queries. The function must handle up to 3n queries for each test case and respond accordingly.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
