Output State: **An anonymous lambda function `I` is defined which takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. No specific variables are assigned values yet.**

This lambda function `I` allows the program to read multiple integers from the standard input and convert them into a list of integers. However, no variables are assigned values directly within this snippet, so the initial state remains unchanged except for the definition of the lambda function.
