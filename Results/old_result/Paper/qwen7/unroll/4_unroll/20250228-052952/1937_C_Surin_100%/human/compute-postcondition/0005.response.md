Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing. It manages interactions with an external interactor through standard input and output. The interactor provides the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the size of the permutation and the results of the queries. The function must handle up to 3n queries for each test case and respond accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to read data from standard input, process it according to the specified rules, and output results to standard output without needing any input parameters.
