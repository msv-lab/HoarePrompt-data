Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the code does not affect `n`, the value range for `n` remains unchanged. Similarly, the code introduces a new variable `n` which is assigned the value of an integer read from the input, ensuring that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Therefore, the updated states of the variables are as stated in the output.
