Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each test case, it initializes `ax` to a large value and `bx` to -1.
   - It reads `n` constraints and updates `ax`, `bx`, and a set `cx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no valid `k` that satisfies all constraints, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total range size `(ax - bx + 1)`.
4. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem statement, this approach ensures that the program will correctly compute the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
