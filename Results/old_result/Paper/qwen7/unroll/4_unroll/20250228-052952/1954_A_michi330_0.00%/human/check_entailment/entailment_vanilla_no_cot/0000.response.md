Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution has several issues:

1. **Case Handling**: The logic in the `if` statement does not correctly handle all cases where Alice can ensure Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
2. **Mathematical Calculation**: The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` is unnecessary and incorrect for determining whether Alice can achieve her goal.
3. **Boolean Logic**: The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is not sufficient to determine if Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

Let's break down the correct approach:

- If `m > k`, Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color because he can only repaint up to `k` parts.
- If `m <= k`, Alice cannot guarantee that Bob cannot make all parts the same color because Bob can repaint all parts to the same color.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version correctly handles all test cases as per the problem statement.
