### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- Bob can repaint at most `k` parts of the ribbon to the same color.
- We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Initial State**: `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.
2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent him.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Case `n <= k`**:
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts, so the condition `print('NO')` is correct.

2. **Case `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`**:
   - This condition checks if the number of parts that are not already the same color (`n - math.ceil(n / m)`) is less than `k`.
   - If this condition holds, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the condition `print('NO')` is correct.

3. **Case `n - math.ceil(n / m) >= k`**:
   - If this condition holds, then Bob cannot make all parts the same color, so the condition `print('Yes')` is correct.

#### Example Test Cases:
1. **Case `5 2 1`**:
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 1`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = 3` (since `5 // 2 = 2` and `5 % 2 = 1`, so `math.ceil(5 / 2) = 3`)
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`
   - Since `2 >= 1`, the condition `print('Yes')` is correct.

2. **Case `5 2 2`**:
   - `n = 5`, `m = 2`, `k = 2`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = 3`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 3 = 2`
   - Since `2 >= 2`, the condition `print('Yes')` is correct.

3. **Case `5 5 3`**:
   - `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 3`
   - `math.ceil(n / m) = 1`
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) = 5 - 1 = 4`
   - Since `4 >= 3`, the condition `print('Yes')` is correct.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all cases based on the conditions provided. The original assessment incorrectly identified issues that do not exist in the given implementation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
