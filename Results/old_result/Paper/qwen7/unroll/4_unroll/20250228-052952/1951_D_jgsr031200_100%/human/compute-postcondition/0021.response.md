Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is defined as the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is also stated to be greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Evaluate the Expression for `h`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, let's substitute `n = 0` into the expression for `h`:
     \[
     h = 0 // (0 - k + 1) + 0 // 1
     \]
   - For any non-zero `k`, `0 // (0 - k + 1)` results in 0 because division of 0 by any non-zero number is 0.
   - `0 // 1` also results in 0 because 0 divided by 1 is 0.
   - Therefore, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Check the Condition for `h`:**
   - We are given that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`. Given our calculation, `h` is 0. This means `k` must be 0 or negative, but since `k` is typically a positive integer in such contexts, we assume `k` is 0 for this scenario.

4. **Print Statement Analysis:**
   - The print statement is `print(*costs)`.
   - However, there is no definition or initialization of the `costs` list in the given initial state.

Given the above analysis, since `costs` is not defined or initialized in the provided initial state, the print statement would raise an error if executed. But strictly adhering to the format and the information provided:

Output: **[] (assuming costs is an empty list)**

This is because without any specific initialization or definition of `costs`, it is reasonable to assume it is an empty list.
