Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the iterable `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being the first element of the `costs` list.

3. **Determine the initial state of `costs`**: The `costs` list contains two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `costs` must contain at least one element. Since `costs` is defined as a list with two elements, the loop will always execute regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

5. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to the first element of `costs` when the loop starts.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to the first element of `costs`, which is `n - k + 1`.
- `costs` should remain as a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: `i` is `n - k + 1`, `costs` is a list containing `[n - k + 1, 1]`**
