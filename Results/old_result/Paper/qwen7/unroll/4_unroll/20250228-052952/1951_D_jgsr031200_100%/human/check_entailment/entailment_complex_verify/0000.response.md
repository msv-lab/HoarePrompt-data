### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob needs Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" and exits.
   - If `n >= k`, the program proceeds to calculate the prices for the stalls.

2. **Price Calculation:**
   - The program sets the prices for the first two stalls as `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updates `n` accordingly.
   - If the sum of jewels bought from these two stalls is less than `k`, the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2) along with the calculated prices.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
1. **Case `n == k`:**
   - The program correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - This is correct because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is 1.

2. **Case `n < k`:**
   - The program correctly prints "NO".
   - This is correct because Alice cannot buy even one jewel if she has fewer coins than the required number of jewels.

3. **Case `n >= k`:**
   - The program sets the prices for the first two stalls as `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - Let's verify if this ensures Alice buys exactly `k` jewels:
     - From the first stall, Alice can buy \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor\) jewels.
     - From the second stall, Alice can buy \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - (n - k + 1) \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{n}{n - k + 1} \right\rfloor}{1} \right\rfloor\) jewels.
     - The sum of these jewels should be exactly `k`.

   - Consider the example `n = 255` and `k = 8`:
     - First stall price: \(255 - 8 + 1 = 248\)
     - Jewels bought from the first stall: \(\left\lfloor \frac{255}{248} \right\rfloor = 1\)
     - Remaining coins after first stall: \(255 - 248 = 7\)
     - Second stall price: \(1\)
     - Jewels bought from the second stall: \(\left\lfloor \frac{7}{1} \right\rfloor = 7\)
     - Total jewels bought: \(1 + 7 = 8\)

   - The program correctly prints "YES" and the prices `[248, 1]`.

4. **General Case:**
   - The program correctly handles the general case where the number of stalls is limited to 2.
   - It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting the prices appropriately.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels when `n >= k`. It handles the edge cases where `n == k` and `n < k` correctly. Although the program only considers up to 2 stalls, it still satisfies the problem requirements for the given constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem statement and the given constraints.
