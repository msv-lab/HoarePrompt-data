### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we also need to output the number of stalls and the prices for those stalls.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It then calls `func_1(n, k)`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If so, it prints "YES", 1 (indicating one stall), and 1 (indicating the price of 1 coin per jewel). This is a trivial case.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy even one jewel.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`. This seems to be an attempt to split the problem into two parts.
   - It then calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each part (`curr`) and updates `h` (total number of stalls needed) and `n` (remaining coins after buying jewels).
   - Finally, it checks if `h` (total stalls) is less than `k`. If so, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2 (indicating two stalls), and the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for handling the trivial case (`n == k`) is correct.
   - The logic for handling the case where `n < k` is correct.
   - However, the logic for splitting the problem into two parts and calculating the number of stalls and prices does not seem to fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, it assumes only two stalls, which may not always be sufficient to achieve exactly `k` jewels.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem:
     - **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
       - The code correctly prints "YES", 1, and 1.
     - **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
       - The code incorrectly prints "NO" instead of "YES" and the appropriate number of stalls and prices.
     - **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
       - The code correctly prints "YES", 8, and the appropriate prices.

6. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle cases where more than two stalls are needed. For instance, in Test Case 2 (`n = 6`, `k = 4`), the function should be able to find a way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels. The current implementation fails to do so.
   - The function also does not consider all possible ways to distribute the stalls and prices to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when more than two stalls are needed. Therefore, the code is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
