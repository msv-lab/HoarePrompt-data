### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
- Alice has `n` coins.
- Bob wants Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.
- Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with prices ranging from 1 to \(10^{18}\).
- Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and moving to the next until she runs out of coins or buys `k` jewels.

#### Given Program:
```python
import math as m
import collections as c

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    func_1(n, k)

def func_1(n, k):
    if n == k:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(1)
        return
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    costs = [n - k + 1, 1]
    h = 0
    for i in costs:
        curr = n // i
        h += curr
        n -= i * curr
    if h < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(*costs)
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
1. **Initial Check:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints `YES` and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1, ensuring Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints `NO` and returns immediately.

2. **General Case:**
   - The program initializes `costs` with `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - It calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall and updates `h` (the total number of jewels bought) and `n` (remaining coins).
   - If `h < k`, the program prints `NO` because Alice did not buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `h >= k`, the program prints `YES` and the number of stalls (2) along with the prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 1: `n == k`**
  - The program correctly prints `YES` and sets up 1 stall with a price of 1.
  - This handles the trivial case where Alice already has `k` coins.

- **Case 2: `n < k`**
  - The program correctly prints `NO` because Alice cannot buy even one jewel.

- **General Case: `n >= k`**
  - The program sets up 2 stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
  - Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (since `n // (n - k + 1) == 1`), leaving her with `n - (n - k + 1) = k - 1` coins.
  - She will then buy 1 jewel from the second stall (since `n // 1 == k - 1`), leaving her with 0 coins.
  - Therefore, Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

However, the program does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program sets up 2 stalls with prices `[248, 1]`, which results in Alice buying only 1 jewel from the first stall and no jewels from the second stall, totaling only 1 jewel, which is far less than `k`.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed. It only works for the specific case where the number of stalls is limited to 2. Therefore, the program is not correct for all test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where more than 2 stalls are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
