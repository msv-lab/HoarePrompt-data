Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even using `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1`.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winning player or 2 points in total if it's a draw).

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - If the sum is even, the program calculates the maximum possible number of draws.
   - The formula used is: 
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - This formula aims to find the maximum number of draws by subtracting the minimum possible points from the total points and then dividing by 2.

### Detailed Explanation of the Formula

- **Total Points Calculation:**
  - The total points scored by all players is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
  - Each game can contribute up to 2 points (if there is a winner) or 2 points (if it's a draw).

- **Adjustment for Minimum Possible Points:**
  - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that we do not subtract more than the minimum points that `p3` should have to be consistent with `p1` and `p2`.
  - If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, it means `p3` already has more points than what `p1` and `p2` can give, so we do not subtract anything.

- **Dividing by 2:**
  - Since each draw contributes 2 points in total, we divide the adjusted total points by 2 to get the number of draws.

### Edge Cases

- **All Zeros:**
  - For `0 0 0`, the sum is even, and the result is correctly calculated as 0.

- **Single Draw:**
  - For `0 1 1`, the sum is even, and the result is correctly calculated as 1.

- **Invalid Case:**
  - For `1 1 2`, the sum is even, but the result is incorrectly calculated as 2. The correct answer should be 1 because the only way to achieve these scores is with one draw between the first and second player, and one win for the third player.

### Conclusion

The program fails to handle some edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for certain inputs where the scores are not consistent with the rules of the game.

### Correctness

Given the analysis, the program is not entirely correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
