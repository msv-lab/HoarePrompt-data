Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates within the context of test cases where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers between 0 and 30, inclusive, with p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3. The function processes these test cases and returns a result based on the given conditions.**
