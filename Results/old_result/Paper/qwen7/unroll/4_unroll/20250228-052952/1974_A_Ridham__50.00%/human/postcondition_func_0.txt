The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on \(x\) and \(y\) and appends it to a list. If \(y\) is even, it calculates half of \(y\); if odd, it calculates half of \(y\) plus one. It then checks if \(x\) can fit within the remaining cells, and if not, calculates the additional screens needed. Finally, it prints the list of calculated values, one per line.
