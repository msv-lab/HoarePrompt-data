You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). It calculates the value of `ans` as `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`, where `i` ranges from 2 to the square root of `n`. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `ans` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. It expects two arguments \(n\) and \(k\), but these are not used in the problem statement.
   - The main loop reads input and calls `func_1()`, but it should call a function that takes \(n\) and \(m\) as parameters.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid pairs using a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the problem. This approach does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Missing Calculation**:
   - The program does not perform the necessary calculations to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply counts some values without considering the actual constraints.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
