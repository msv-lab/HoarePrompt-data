Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1 in an optimal way. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not consider all possible ways Bob can multiply elements by -1 after Alice has removed elements. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
- Expected Output: `-9`
- Actual Output: `3`

In this case, Alice can remove the largest element `32`, and Bob can multiply the smallest element `3` by -1. The optimal strategy would result in the sum being `-9` (`3 + 7 + 3 + 3 - 15 - 32`), but the current implementation does not account for this scenario properly.

The function `func_2` does not explore all combinations of elements that Alice can remove and all combinations of elements that Bob can multiply by -1, leading to suboptimal results in certain scenarios.
