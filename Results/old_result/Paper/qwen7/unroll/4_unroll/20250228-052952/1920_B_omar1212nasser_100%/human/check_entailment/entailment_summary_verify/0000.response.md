### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` takes three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`.
- It sorts the elements and calculates several sums based on different configurations of removals and negations.
- The function iterates through up to `removals` and considers up to `negatives` negations, calculating the sum for each combination.
- It returns the maximum sum found among these configurations.

#### Function Summary Validation:
- The function summary correctly describes the process of calculating sums based on different removal and negation strategies.
- The function indeed explores various configurations of removals and negations, which aligns with the problem's requirement for optimal play from both players.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The main function `func_1` reads the input and calls `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
- `func_2` correctly handles the logic of removing elements and considering negations.
- The function summary accurately reflects the behavior of `func_2`.

Given the analysis, the program does handle the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The function `func_2` correctly explores all possible configurations of removals and negations, ensuring that the optimal sum is found.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw in the program. The program does correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.

**Final: True**
