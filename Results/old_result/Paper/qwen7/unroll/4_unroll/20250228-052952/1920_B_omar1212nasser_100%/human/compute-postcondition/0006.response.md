Output State: `pos` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, `removals` remains the same as its initial value, `negatives` remains the same as its initial value, and `elements` is the same list of integers as in the initial state but with the last `i` elements removed for each iteration of the loop.
