Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)` entered via input; `d` is a list of integers where each element represents the shortest distance from node 0 to the corresponding node; `previous` is a list obtained from BFS starting from the value of `a`; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the value of `a`. The BFS function returns two values: `d`, which remains unchanged and is the shortest distance from node 0 to the corresponding node, and `previous`, which is a list indicating the previous node in the shortest path for each node. The variable `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, which means `a` retains its original value after the function call.
