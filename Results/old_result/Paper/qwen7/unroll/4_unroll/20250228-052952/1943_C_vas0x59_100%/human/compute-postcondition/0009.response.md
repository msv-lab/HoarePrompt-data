Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)` entered via input, `d` is a list of integers where each element represents the shortest distance from node 0 to the corresponding node, `previous` is a list obtained from BFS starting from the value of `a`, `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

This output state reflects that the variable `path_ba` has been updated to contain the value `b`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
