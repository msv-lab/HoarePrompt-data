Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)` entered via input; `d` is a list of integers where each element represents the shortest distance from node 0 to the corresponding node.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the `bfs` function with the starting node `0`. The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search on the graph represented by `u2vs` and returns two values: `d`, which is a list of integers representing the shortest distance from node 0 to every other node, and an underscore `_` which is used to ignore the second return value (which is typically the set of visited nodes). After executing this line, the variable `d` is updated with the shortest distances, while `u2vs` remains unchanged.
