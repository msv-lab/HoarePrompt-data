Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for t in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the behavior of the loop**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range. When `t` is no longer within this range after an input, the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Since the loop is driven by user input, we cannot guarantee what value `t` will take after the first iteration without knowing the input. However, for the loop to start executing, `t` must be within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
