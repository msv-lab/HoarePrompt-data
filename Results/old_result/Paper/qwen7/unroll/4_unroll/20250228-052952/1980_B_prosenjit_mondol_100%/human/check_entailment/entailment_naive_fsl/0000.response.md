Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the scenario where the favorite cube is exactly equal to the k-th cube after sorting, but the k-th cube is not the last cube and the (k+1)-th cube is also equal to the favorite cube. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints "YES" instead of "MAYBE".

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5 5
1 2 5 4 3
```
- The favorite cube is the 5th one with value 3.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The k-th cube (5th cube) is `1`, which is less than the favorite cube `3`, so the program correctly prints "YES".
- However, consider another input:
```
5 5 5
4 3 2 1 3
```
- The favorite cube is the 5th one with value 3.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 2, 1]`.
- The k-th cube (5th cube) is `1`, which is less than the favorite cube `3`, so the program correctly prints "YES".
- But now consider:
```
5 5 5
4 3 3 3 2
```
- The favorite cube is the 5th one with value 2.
- After sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The k-th cube (5th cube) is `2`, which is equal to the favorite cube `2`. However, the (k+1)-th cube is also `3`, so the favorite cube might or might not be removed depending on the exact positions. The program should print "MAYBE" in this case, but it prints "YES".

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
