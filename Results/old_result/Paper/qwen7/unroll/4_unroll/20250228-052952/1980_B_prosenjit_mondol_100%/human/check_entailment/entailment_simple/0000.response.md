Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`, and adjusts `f` and `k` to be zero-indexed.
3. It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes.
4. The program sorts the list `a` in descending order.
5. It compares the value of the `k`-th largest element in the sorted list with the value of the favorite cube (`x`).
6. If the `k`-th largest element is greater than `x`, it prints 'NO'.
7. If the `k`-th largest element is smaller than `x`, it prints 'YES'.
8. If the `k`-th largest element is equal to `x`, it checks additional conditions to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'MAYBE':
   - If the `k`-th element is the last element in the list and the `(k+1)`-th element is not smaller than `x`, it prints 'MAYBE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
