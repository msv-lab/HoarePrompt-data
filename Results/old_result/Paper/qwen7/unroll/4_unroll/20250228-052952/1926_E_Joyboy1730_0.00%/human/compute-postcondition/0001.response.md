Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.

3. **Initial state**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), and `t` is now the integer value entered by the user.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraints, this is already satisfied since \(1 \leq t\).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is a positive integer, which it already is based on the given constraints.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` must be a positive integer (which is already given as \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\))**
