The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints a number based on specific conditions involving n and k. The function does not return any value but produces a series of outputs, one for each test case. The variable t remains unchanged after processing all test cases, but the output consists of numbers printed during each iteration.
