The function processes multiple pairs of positive integers (b, c) within the range of 1 to 100. For each pair, it checks the relationship between b and c and prints one of four possible responses: 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No'. The final state of the program consists of a series of these printed responses, one for each input pair.
