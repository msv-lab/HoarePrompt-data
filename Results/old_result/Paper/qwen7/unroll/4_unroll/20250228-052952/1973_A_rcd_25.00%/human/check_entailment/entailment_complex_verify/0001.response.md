### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and flow of the program. Let's break down the key points to ensure the correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.

3. **Initial Check for Maximum Score:**
   - The program correctly checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2` because the maximum score `p3` can achieve without any draws is `p1 + p2`. This implies no draws occurred, and the maximum number of draws is `0`.

4. **Finding the Range for Draws:**
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum possible draws using the variables `low` and `high`. `low` is `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, and `high` is `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`. These calculations ensure that the range of possible draws is correctly identified.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws. It starts from `low` and increments `cur` until `high < cur`. For each value of `cur`, it checks if the current configuration of draws is valid by ensuring that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the maximum number of draws is found.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where no valid configuration exists by printing `-1` if the loop completes without finding a valid configuration.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the original assessment accurately describes the logic and flow of the program. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
