You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

                else:
                    cur += 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())

        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())

            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low

                else:
                    cur += 1

                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even and \(p3\) is less than \(p1 + p2\), the output will be \(p1 + p2\). Otherwise, it will find a value for \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and print \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) is found, it prints \(p3\). The final state will be a list of outputs from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd or \(p_3\) is greater than or equal to \(p_1 + p_2\), it outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it finds a value \(cur\) such that \(p_1 - cur \leq p_2 - (p3 - cur)\) and outputs \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) exists, it outputs \(p3\). The function returns a list of outputs, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.
   
3. **Initial Check for Maximum Score:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This implies that the maximum score `p3` can achieve without any draws is `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it means no draws occurred, and the maximum number of draws is `0`.

4. **Finding the Range for Draws:**
   - If the above condition is false, the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible draws using the variables `low` and `high`.
   - `low` is calculated as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, which represents the minimum number of draws required to make the scores consistent.
   - `high` is calculated as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, which represents the maximum number of draws possible.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws. It starts from `low` and increments until `high < cur`.
   - For each value of `cur`, it checks if the current configuration of draws is valid by ensuring that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where no valid solution exists by printing `-1` if the loop completes without finding a valid configuration.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Even Total Points Check:** The check `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` correctly identifies invalid cases where the total points cannot be even.
- **Initial Check for Maximum Score:** The logic `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is correct for determining if no draws occurred.
- **Range Calculation:** The calculation of `low` and `high` correctly identifies the range of possible draws.
- **Binary Search Approach:** The binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws is logically sound and correctly implemented.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles cases where no valid configuration exists by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
