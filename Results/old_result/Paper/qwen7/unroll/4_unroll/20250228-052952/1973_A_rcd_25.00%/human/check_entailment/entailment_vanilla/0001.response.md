Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.
   
3. **Initial Check for Maximum Score:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This implies that the maximum score `p3` can achieve without any draws is `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it means no draws occurred, and the maximum number of draws is `0`.

4. **Finding the Range for Draws:**
   - If the above condition is false, the program calculates the minimum and maximum possible draws using the variables `low` and `high`.
   - `low` is calculated as `min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, which represents the minimum number of draws required to make the scores consistent.
   - `high` is calculated as `max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)`, which represents the maximum number of draws possible.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The program uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws. It starts from `low` and increments until `high < cur`.
   - For each value of `cur`, it checks if the current configuration of draws is valid by ensuring that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where no valid solution exists by printing `-1` if the loop completes without finding a valid configuration.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Even Total Points Check:** The check `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` correctly identifies invalid cases where the total points cannot be even.
- **Initial Check for Maximum Score:** The logic `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is correct for determining if no draws occurred.
- **Range Calculation:** The calculation of `low` and `high` correctly identifies the range of possible draws.
- **Binary Search Approach:** The binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws is logically sound and correctly implemented.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles cases where no valid configuration exists by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
