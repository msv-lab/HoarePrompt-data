Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the implementation:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Sum Check**: It first checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to the other, or 2 points in total if it's a draw.

3. **Invalid Case Handling**: If the sum is odd or if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the function prints `-1` because these conditions violate the rules of the game. This is correctly handled.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws**: If the above conditions are not met, the program attempts to find the maximum number of draws. It does this by iterating over possible values of `cur` (which represents the number of draws involving the first and third players) and checking if the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied. If such a `cur` is found, it calculates the maximum possible draws as `p1 - cur + p3`. If no valid `cur` is found, it defaults to printing `p3`.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
