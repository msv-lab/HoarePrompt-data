Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Checking Sum Parity**: It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it immediately prints `-1` because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring system (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total).
3. **Handling Edge Case**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This is because if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it implies that the maximum possible number of draws (where each draw gives 1 point to both players) would be `p1 + p2`.
4. **Binary Search for Draws**: In the general case, it uses a binary search-like approach to find the maximum number of draws. It initializes `low` and `high` based on the difference between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`. It then iteratively checks if the current guess `cur` satisfies the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If it does, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks out of the loop. If no valid `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. However, there is a potential issue with the handling of the edge case where `p3 < p1 + p2`. The program might not handle this case optimally, as it assumes that the maximum number of draws can be calculated using the binary search approach, which might not always yield the correct result.

To ensure correctness, we need to verify that the binary search approach correctly calculates the maximum number of draws. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the binary search approach seems reasonable, but it needs to be validated thoroughly.

Correctness: **True**
