You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)

                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())

            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)

                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even and \(p3\) is less than \(p1 + p2\), the output will be \(p1 + p2\). Otherwise, it will find a value for \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and print \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) is found, it prints \(p3\). The final state will be a list of outputs from each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of draws and the constraints of the problem. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Check for Odd Sum**: The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. This check is correct, but it does not cover all scenarios where the sum is even.

2. **Handling Scores**: The program assumes that `p3 >= p1 + p2` and directly prints `p1 + p2` if this condition is met. However, this assumption is too restrictive. For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem statement, the scores can be achieved through two draws (each player gets 1 point from a draw). The current implementation does not account for this scenario.

3. **Binary Search for Draws**: The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program attempts to incrementally find the maximum number of draws, but it does not correctly handle the constraints and edge cases. For instance, in the input `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Ensure the sum of the scores is even.
- Consider all possible ways to distribute the scores among the players, including draws.
- Handle cases where the scores cannot be achieved through valid games and results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
