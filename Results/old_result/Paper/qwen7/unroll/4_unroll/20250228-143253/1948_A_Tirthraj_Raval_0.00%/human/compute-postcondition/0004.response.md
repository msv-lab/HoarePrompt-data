Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, t and n, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. It returns a value based on the relationship between t and n.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters, the description should focus on the implied behavior:
