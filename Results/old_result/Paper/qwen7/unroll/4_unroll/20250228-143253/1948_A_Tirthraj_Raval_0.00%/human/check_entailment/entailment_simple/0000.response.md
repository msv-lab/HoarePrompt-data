Reasoning:
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.
- It checks if `n` is odd or even.
- If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO', which is correct because an odd number of special characters cannot be formed with the given constraints.
- If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' and generates a pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, which ensures that every character except the first and last is a special character (since each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors).
- The pattern generated has a length of `n/2`, which means the total length of the string is `n`, satisfying the requirement that the string can be of length at most 200.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
