The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` represents the number of integers in the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The function returns either the number of integers `n` in the list `nums` or the count of indices `i` for which the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `math.ceil(k / 2)` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `k // 2`.
