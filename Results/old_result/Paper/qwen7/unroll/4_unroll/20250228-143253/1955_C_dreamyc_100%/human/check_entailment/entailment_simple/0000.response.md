Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the number of ships that sink after the Kraken attacks them in a specific pattern.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by calculating the sum of the durability of the ships and comparing it with the number of attacks.
3. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the number of ships that would sink based on the sum of the first `i+1` elements and the last `i+1` elements of the durability list, rather than simulating the actual attack sequence.
4. The correct approach should simulate the attack process as described: alternating between the first and last ships until all ships are sunk or the attacks are exhausted.
5. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the attack process and instead uses a heuristic that does not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not properly simulate the Kraken's attack sequence.

Correctness: **False**
