Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, and `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
