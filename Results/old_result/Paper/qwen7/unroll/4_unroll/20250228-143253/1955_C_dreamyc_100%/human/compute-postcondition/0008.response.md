Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` for which the sum of the first half (up to index `i`) is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the second half (from index `n-i-1` to the end) is less than or equal to `b`, `s_a` is the cumulative sum of the first half of `nums`, `s_b` is the cumulative sum of the second half of `nums`.
