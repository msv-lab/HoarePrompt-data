Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate a sum using the formula `sum = 1 + (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. However, this formula does not seem to relate to the problem statement. The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements by performing at most `2n` operations of two types. The formula provided does not reflect the intended operations.

2. **Operation Execution**: The program prints `n + n` operations for each test case, but these operations do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, it prints two identical operations for each row, which is not consistent with the problem's constraints and objectives. The problem requires setting rows and columns to permutations, not simply repeating the same operation.

3. **Permutations**: The program does not generate permutations as specified in the problem. Instead, it prints the range of numbers from 1 to `n` repeatedly, which does not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
