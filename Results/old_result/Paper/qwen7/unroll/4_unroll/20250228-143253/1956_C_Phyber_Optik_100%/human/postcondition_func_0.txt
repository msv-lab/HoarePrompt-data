The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula and prints the sum along with `n + n`. Additionally, it prints two blocks of output for each value of `n`, where the first column alternates between 1 and 2, the second column decreases from `n` to 1, and the third column contains the range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
