### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation either permutes the elements of a row or a column.
   - The correct approach involves filling the matrix with the values 1 through \(n^2\) in such a way that the sum is maximized.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which is the size of the matrix.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1, and then it attempts to calculate a sum using a loop. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect and does not relate to the problem's requirements.
   - The program prints `sum` and `2n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations, respectively.
   - Two operations are printed for each row (or column), but these operations do not seem to follow the problem's constraints correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to fill the matrix with the values 1 through \(n^2\) in such a way that the sum is maximized.
   - We can achieve this by performing \(n\) row operations and \(n\) column operations.
   - Each row operation can set the row to a permutation of the sequence from 1 to \(n\).
   - Each column operation can similarly set the column to a permutation of the sequence from 1 to \(n\).

4. **Verification**:
   - The given program incorrectly calculates `sum` and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum.
   - The operations printed do not follow the problem's constraints correctly.
   - Specifically, the sum calculation is incorrect, and the operations performed do not result in the desired permutations of rows and columns.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code confirms that the program initializes `sum` to 1 and then incorrectly calculates a sum using a loop. This sum is not related to the problem's requirements.
   - The program then prints `sum` and `2n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations, respectively. This is incorrect because `sum` is not the correct sum of the matrix after the operations.
   - The operations printed do not follow the problem's constraints correctly. Instead of permuting rows and columns, the program simply prints the same permutation for each row and column, which does not maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**
