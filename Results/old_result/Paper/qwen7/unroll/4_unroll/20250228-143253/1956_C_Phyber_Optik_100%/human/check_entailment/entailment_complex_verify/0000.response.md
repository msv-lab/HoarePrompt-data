### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` to 1.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n` and calculates a sum based on the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
     \]
   - This formula does not seem to have any relation to the operations described in the problem statement. The operations involve setting specific permutations of the rows and columns, not performing arithmetic operations on `i`.

3. **Output Generation:**
   - The program prints the calculated sum and `n + n`.
   - It then prints two blocks of output for each value of `n`:
     - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, it prints:
       - A Type 1 operation where the row index is `n - j + 1` and the permutation is `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
       - A Type 2 operation where the column index is `n - j + 1` and the permutation is `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix by performing up to 2n operations, where each operation either permutes the elements of a row or a column. The provided program does not achieve this goal:

- The sum calculation is unrelated to the problem requirements.
- The operations performed do not maximize the sum of the matrix. Instead, they simply permute the rows and columns in a fixed manner, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
