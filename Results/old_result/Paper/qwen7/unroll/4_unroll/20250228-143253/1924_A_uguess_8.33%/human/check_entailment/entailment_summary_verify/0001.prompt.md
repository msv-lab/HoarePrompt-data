You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(m\), and a string \(s\) of length \(m\) consisting of the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the number of distinct substrings of \(s\) that contain all \(k\) characters is at least \(n\). If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a string constructed from the characters of \(s\) and the character 'a'. The function ensures that \(t\) is between 1 and \(10^5\), \(n\) and \(k\) are between 1 and 26, \(m\) is between 1 and 1000, and the sum of \(m\) across all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to provide one such missing string.

2. **Key Points in the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which of the first `k` alphabets have been seen in the string `s`.
   - It iterates through each character of `s` and updates the bitmask accordingly.
   - If the bitmask reaches `(1 << k) - 1` (indicating all `k` alphabets have been seen), it increments a counter `cnt`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly tracks the presence of all `k` alphabets in the string `s`.
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it means all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences of `s`, hence prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it means some strings cannot be formed, so it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` to show one such missing string.

4. **Constructing the Missing String:**
   - The code constructs a string `ans` by identifying the first missing alphabet and appending enough 'a's to make the string of length `n`.
   - This part of the logic seems to be flawed because it constructs a string based on the last seen bitmask state, which might not necessarily represent a valid missing string of length `n`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code does not handle cases where multiple strings could be missing but only outputs one.
   - The construction of `ans` might not always produce a valid string of length `n` that is missing as a subsequence.

### Conclusion:

The code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the construction of the missing string `ans` is flawed and might not always produce a valid result.

### Correctness:

**False**
