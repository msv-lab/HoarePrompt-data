Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Bitmask Logic**: The logic used to track the presence of each character in the current substring `s` is flawed. The bitmask approach is not correctly implemented to ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.

2. **Counting Combinations**: The variable `cnt` is incremented whenever all `k` characters are found in sequence, but this does not guarantee that all combinations of length `n` are present.

3. **Generating the Result String**: The generation of the result string `ans` is incorrect. It assumes that the last character missing from the combination is always the one with the highest index, which is not necessarily true.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that every possible combination of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of `s`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k lowercase English alphabets
        all_combinations = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        found = True
        for comb in all_combinations:
            if not is_subsequence(s, comb):
                found = False
                break
        
        if found:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            print(next(comb for comb in all_combinations if not is_subsequence(s, comb)))

def is_subsequence(s, sub):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in sub)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Generate All Combinations**: Use `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Check Subsequences**: For each generated combination, check if it is a subsequence of `s` using the helper function `is_subsequence`.
3. **Report Result**: If all combinations are subsequences, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO" followed by the first combination that is not a subsequence.

This approach ensures that all possible combinations are checked and handles the problem correctly.
