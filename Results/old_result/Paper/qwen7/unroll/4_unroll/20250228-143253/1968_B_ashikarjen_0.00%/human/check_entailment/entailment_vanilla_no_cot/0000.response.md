Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `k` to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. It also initializes `j` to 0, which will be used to traverse string `b`.

3. **Traversing String `a`**: For each character in string `a`:
   - It uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in `b`.
   - If the character is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments `k` and moves to the next character in `b` (`j += 1`).
   - If the character is not found within the bounds of `b`, it breaks out of the loop, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot be a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly determines the maximum prefix length `k` for each test case. Therefore, the given program is correct.
