Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; n is assigned the value of the first integer input split by space; m is assigned the value of the second integer input split by space.**

The code reads two integers from the input, splits them by a space, and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
