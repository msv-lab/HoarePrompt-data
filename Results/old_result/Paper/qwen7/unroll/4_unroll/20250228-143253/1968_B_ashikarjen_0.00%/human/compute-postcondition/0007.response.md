Output State: `j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input split by space, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, `k` is 0.

Explanation: After the loop executes, `j` will iterate through the entire length of string `b` (i.e., `m`), because for each character in `a` (total `n` characters), `j` is incremented until it either finds a match or reaches the end of `b`. Since the loop breaks when `j` reaches `m` without finding a match for all characters in `a`, `j` will be set to `m`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
