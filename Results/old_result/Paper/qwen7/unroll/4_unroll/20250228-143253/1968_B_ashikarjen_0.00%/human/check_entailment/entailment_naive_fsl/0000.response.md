Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. The program iterates through each character of string `a` and checks if it can be found in string `b` in order, updating the count `k` accordingly. The program handles all given examples and potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that it works correctly for any valid input within the specified constraints.
