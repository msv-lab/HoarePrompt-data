Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is assigned the value of the first integer input split by space; m is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is the string input from the user; b is the next string input from the user.**

Explanation: The code `b = input()` reads a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
