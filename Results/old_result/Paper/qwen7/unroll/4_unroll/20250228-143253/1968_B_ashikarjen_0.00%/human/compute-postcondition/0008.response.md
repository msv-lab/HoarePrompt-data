Based on the initial state provided:

- `j` is set to `m`.
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the first integer input split by space.
- `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5.
- `a` is the string input from the user.
- `b` is the next string input from the user.
- `k` is 0.

The loop iterates over the string `a` and checks if each character in `a` exists in `b`. If a character is found, `j` is reset to 0. If no character is found after iterating through `a`, `j` will be set to `m`.

Since the loop breaks when `j` reaches `m` without finding a match for all characters in `a`, `j` will be set to `m`. The value of `k` remains 0 as it is not affected by the loop.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `k`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
