You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input split by space, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, `k` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes, `j` will iterate through the entire length of string `b` (i.e., `m`), because for each character in `a` (total `n` characters), `j` is incremented until it either finds a match or reaches the end of `b`. Since the loop breaks when `j` reaches `m` without finding a match for all characters in `a`, `j` will be set to `m`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts four inputs: an integer `t`, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
