Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `cities` is a list of \( n \) integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order.
   - `prog_cities` is a list of \( n-1 \) zeros.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-2`, meaning the loop will execute \( n-1 \) times.

4. **Adjust the states for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` should start at 0.
   - The variable `n` should be such that the loop can run \( n-1 \) times, which means \( n \) must be at least 1 (since \( n-1 \) must be a non-negative integer).

5. **Consider the list `prog_cities`**: Since the loop modifies `prog_cities`, but the initial state of `prog_cities` is given as a list of \( n-1 \) zeros, no adjustment is needed for `prog_cities` itself.

6. **Consider the list `cities`**: The list `cities` is already in the correct form (a list of \( n \) integers in ascending order), so no adjustment is needed for `cities`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
