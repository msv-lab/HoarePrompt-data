### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between any two cities, where the cost depends on whether you move to the closest city or directly to another city. The closest city is defined as the city with the smallest distance to the current city.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It computes the "closest" city information using the `func_1` function.
   - It calculates prefix sums for both forward and backward directions.
   - For each query, it uses these prefix sums to compute the minimum cost efficiently.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to compute an array where each element represents the cost to move to the closest city from the current city.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct:
     - It initializes `forward` and `back` variables to represent the next and previous city coordinates.
     - It checks if moving forward or backward is cheaper and assigns the appropriate value.
     - The result is stored in `prog_cities`, which correctly reflects the cost to move to the closest city for each city.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated correctly, allowing efficient query processing.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - The queries are processed correctly using the prefix sums. The logic to decide whether to use forward or backward prefix sums is sound.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases appropriately, such as the first and last elements of `prog_cities` being zero, which do not affect the results.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
