Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list where the first and last elements are 0, and each element in between is either 1 or the absolute difference between the corresponding city's coordinate and its adjacent city's coordinate in the `cities` list.**

This means that for each city coordinate in the `cities` list (except the first and last), the corresponding element in `prog_cities` will be 1 if the city's coordinate is different from its adjacent city's coordinate, or the absolute difference between those two coordinates otherwise.
