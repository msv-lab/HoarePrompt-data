Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the closest city for each city and using this information to calculate the minimum cost to travel between any two given cities.
2. The provided program seems to have some issues with the implementation of `func_1` and how it uses the results of `func_1`.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the closest city for each city but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the closest city when the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city.
4. The main part of the program attempts to use prefix sums to quickly calculate distances, but it incorrectly assumes that `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` represent the closest city distances in a way that allows direct prefix sum subtraction.
5. The logic in the main part of the program for calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities is flawed because it does not correctly account for the actual closest city distances.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
