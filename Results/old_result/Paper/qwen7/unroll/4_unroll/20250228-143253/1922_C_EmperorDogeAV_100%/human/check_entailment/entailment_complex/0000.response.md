Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between cities, where the cost depends on whether you move to the closest city or another city directly.
2. The annotated program includes a function `func_1` which seems to be incorrectly implemented. This function should identify the closest city for each city but instead calculates some differences without correctly identifying the closest city.
3. The main part of the program calculates prefix sums for forward and backward movements using the output of `func_1`. However, since `func_1` is not correctly identifying the closest cities, the prefix sums will not be meaningful for solving the problem.
4. The logic in the main part of the program assumes that `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` contain the distances to the closest cities, but this assumption is flawed due to the incorrect implementation of `func_1`.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the solution provided does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city, which is a crucial step in determining the minimum cost of travel. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is False.
