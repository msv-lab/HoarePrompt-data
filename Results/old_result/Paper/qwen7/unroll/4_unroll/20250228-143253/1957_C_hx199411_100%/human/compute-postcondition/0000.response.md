Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` is now explicitly set to the integer input received. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
