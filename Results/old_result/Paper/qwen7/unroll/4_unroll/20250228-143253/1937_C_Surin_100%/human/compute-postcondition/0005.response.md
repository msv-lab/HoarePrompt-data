Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the provided code snippet, the function does not explicitly accept any parameters. The description suggests that the function might handle a fixed permutation provided by an interactor, but since the function definition itself does not list any parameters, we can conclude that the function does not accept any parameters and thus does not return anything based on the given information.
