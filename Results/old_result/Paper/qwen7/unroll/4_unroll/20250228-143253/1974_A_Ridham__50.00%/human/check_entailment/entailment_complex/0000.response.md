Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This is correct because each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

3. **Total Space Calculation**:
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x`: This is correct as it sums up the total number of cells needed for all icons.

4. **Screens Required for 2x2 Icons**:
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even.
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd: This is correct because each 2x2 icon requires 2 cells, and any leftover cells (if `y` is odd) will require an additional screen.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.

6. **Checking if Remaining Cells Can Fit 1x1 Icons**:
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining cells, so we append `screen_require_for_y` to the result list.
   - Otherwise, we need to calculate additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells`: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
     - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1`: This calculates the number of additional screens needed, considering that each screen can hold up to 15 cells.

7. **Result Construction**:
   - The program constructs the result list correctly based on the above logic.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case correctly, with each result on a new line.

Given the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic to determine the minimum number of screens required for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
