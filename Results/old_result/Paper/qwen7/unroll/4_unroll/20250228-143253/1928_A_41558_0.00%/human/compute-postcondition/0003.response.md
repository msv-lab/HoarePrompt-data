Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, for each pair (a, b) entered, if both a and b are odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, the output will be 'NO', otherwise it will be 'YES'. The total number of outputs will be equal to the value of n.
