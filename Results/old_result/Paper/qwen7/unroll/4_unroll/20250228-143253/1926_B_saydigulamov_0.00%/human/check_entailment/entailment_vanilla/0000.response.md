### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine whether the grid contains a triangle or a square.
   - The grid is represented by a series of lines, each containing `n` characters (`0` or `1`).
   - The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square formed by `1`s.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
   - It then reads `n` lines of the grid and counts the number of `1`s in each line.
   - The code appends these counts to the list `k`.
   - If the first count in `k` is equal to the second count, it prints `k`.

3. **Issues in the Code:**
   - The logic to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is missing.
   - The code only checks if the first two counts are equal, which is insufficient to determine the shape.
   - The code does not check for the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square.
   - The code does not handle the case where the shape is a triangle or a square correctly.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine if the shape is a square, we need to check if the number of `1`s in each row is the same and forms a square pattern.
   - To determine if the shape is a triangle, we need to check if the number of `1`s in each row follows the pattern of a triangle.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not implement the logic to correctly identify whether the shape is a square or a triangle. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
