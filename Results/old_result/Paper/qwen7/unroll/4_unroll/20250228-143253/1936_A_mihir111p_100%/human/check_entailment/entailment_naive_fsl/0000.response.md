Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to find the maximum XOR value using a series of queries, but it does not properly handle the process of comparing the results of these queries to deduce the indices that maximize the XOR value.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Query Handling**: The program uses `func_1` to compare the results of bitwise OR operations, but it does not correctly handle the logic to deduce the indices that maximize the XOR value. The program seems to be attempting to find the maximum value in a subset of indices, but it does not effectively use the comparison results to narrow down the indices that could potentially give the maximum XOR.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program does not properly utilize the results of the comparisons to update its candidate indices for the maximum XOR. Instead, it seems to be incrementally updating `ans1` and `v`, which does not align with the required logic to find the maximum XOR.

3. **Query Count**: The program is limited to 3n queries, and it does not seem to be efficiently using the queries to find the maximum XOR. The current implementation does not ensure that the program will terminate within the allowed number of queries for all possible permutations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
