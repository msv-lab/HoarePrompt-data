Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum total difference \(D\) such that \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\), where \(c_i\) is chosen from the sorted list \(b\).
2. The program correctly sorts both lists `a` and `b`.
3. It then iterates through the first \(n\) elements of `a` and pairs each element with the corresponding element from the end of `b` (to maximize differences). This is a valid approach because the largest elements of `b` will contribute the most to the total difference.
4. The condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):` is used to check if swapping the current pair would increase the total difference. However, this condition is not necessary for the optimal solution since sorting and pairing from the ends inherently maximizes the differences.
5. The program correctly handles the remaining elements after the initial loop by appending the differences from the end of `b`.

Given the above points, the logic in the program is sound and follows the optimal strategy to maximize the total difference \(D\).

Correctness: **True**
