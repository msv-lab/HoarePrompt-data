Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3; `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each element in `u2vs` is an empty list, representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` is updated according to the new definition.
