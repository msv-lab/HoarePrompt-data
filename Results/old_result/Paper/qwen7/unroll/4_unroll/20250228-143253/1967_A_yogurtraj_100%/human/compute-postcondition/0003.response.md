Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), followed by pairs of integers n and k (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}), and a list a containing n integers (each 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns a result for each test case based on the provided constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
