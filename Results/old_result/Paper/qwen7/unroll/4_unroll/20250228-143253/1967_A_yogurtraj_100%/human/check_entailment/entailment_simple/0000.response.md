Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted, which helps in determining the minimum number of cards needed to reach a certain value. This step is necessary for the logic that follows.

3. **Redistribution Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list `a` to find the point where the remaining budget `k` cannot afford to increase the count of any more cards.
   - If the remaining budget `k` is not enough to increase the count of the next card, it calculates the required redistribution and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the budget `k` is still available after the loop, it redistributes the remaining budget evenly among the last few cards.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the final value of `r` (the highest card value after redistribution).
   - It then calculates the total number of subarrays of length `n` that form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]` using the formula `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in the program seems to correctly implement the solution. The program handles the constraints and the redistribution logic appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
