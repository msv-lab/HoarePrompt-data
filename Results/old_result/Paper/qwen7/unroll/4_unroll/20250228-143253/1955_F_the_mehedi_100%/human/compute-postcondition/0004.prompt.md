You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the initial sequence respectively, where i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) represents the count of numbers of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the final sequence respectively, where i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}.
    #
    #Explanation: After executing the loop for each test case, the value of `cnt` is calculated based on the conditions given in the loop. The final value of `cnt` is printed, which represents the sum of the original numbers divided by 2 and a special condition check. The counts of numbers of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the final sequence are not directly affected by the loop and remain as the initial counts provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a sequence defined by counts of four types (1, 2, 3, and 4) within the range of 0 to 200 for each test case, where the total number of test cases (t) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The function does not return any value but likely performs some operations based on the sequence defined by these counts.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
