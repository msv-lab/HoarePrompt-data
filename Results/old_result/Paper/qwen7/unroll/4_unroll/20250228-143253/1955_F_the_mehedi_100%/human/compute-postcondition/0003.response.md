Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a sequence defined by counts of four types (1, 2, 3, and 4) within the range of 0 to 200 for each test case, where the total number of test cases (t) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The function does not return any value but likely performs some operations based on the sequence defined by these counts.**
