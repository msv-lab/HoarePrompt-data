You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by counts of four types (1, 2, 3, and 4) of numbers within the range of 0 to 200. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` based on specific conditions involving the input counts and prints this value. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated `cnt` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes numbers optimally. Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers representing the count of ones, twos, threes, and fours.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0. This variable is supposed to store the maximum number of Bob's wins.

3. **Win Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are all odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1. This is incorrect because the presence of an odd number of ones, twos, and threes does not directly indicate the number of Bob's wins.

4. **Count Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours and adds the floor division of each by 2 to `cnt`. This operation is also incorrect and does not contribute to the solution.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly:
1. Calculate the total number of elements in the sequence.
2. Determine the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
3. Use these counts to calculate the maximum number of Bob's wins.

### Correct Solution
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones, twos, threes, fours = a
        total_elements = ones + twos + threes + fours
        
        # Calculate the number of Bob's wins
        bob_wins = min(ones, twos // 2 + threes // 2)
        
        print(bob_wins)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program
1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of test cases and the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
2. **Total Elements Calculation**: Calculate the total number of elements in the sequence.
3. **Bob's Wins Calculation**: 
   - The number of Bob's wins is determined by the minimum between the number of ones and half the sum of the number of twos and threes (floored).

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the logic required to solve the problem. The provided solution above is the correct approach.
