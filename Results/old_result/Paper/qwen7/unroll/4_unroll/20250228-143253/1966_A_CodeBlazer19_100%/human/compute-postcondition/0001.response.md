State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `t`.
2. The loop condition `for i in range(t)` requires that `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
3. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
4. The variable `i` starts at 0 when the loop begins.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `t` is within the specified range (1 to 500) and set `i` to its initial value of 0.
