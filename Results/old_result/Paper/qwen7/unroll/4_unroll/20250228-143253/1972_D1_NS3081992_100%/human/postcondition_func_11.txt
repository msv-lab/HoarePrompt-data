The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, initialized with zeros, an integer `da` which is a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` initialized with zeros. It returns 1 if no valid `di` from `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0 exists. Otherwise, it returns the minimum value obtained from `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` such that `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0, plus 1.
