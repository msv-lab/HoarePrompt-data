Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It returns 1 if the condition specified in Case_1 is met; otherwise, it returns -1.**

This means the function checks a specific condition involving the list `a`, the integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and returns either 1 or -1 based on whether that condition is satisfied.
