There is no input parameter for the function. The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the standard input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). Each test case consists of two space-separated integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \), and it is guaranteed that the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \).
