### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several logical errors in the provided program. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected approach:

1. **Condition 2 (`b < c`)**:
   - The original program incorrectly prints 'NO' when `b < c`. This is logically incorrect because it is possible to have fewer moves than cubes if the parity matches, and the difference between `b` and `c` is even.

2. **Condition 3 (`b % 2 == c % 2`)**:
   - While checking the parity is important, it is not sufficient on its own. We need to ensure that the difference between `b` and `c` is even, as each move changes the count by 1.

3. **Revised Program**:
   - The revised program uses `abs(b - c) % 2 == 0` to check if the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.
   - It also ensures that `b >= c` to prevent negative numbers of moves, which is logically sound.

Given the revised program, let's validate it against the annotated code and the problem description:

- **State Before Function Call**: `t` is the number of test cases, and each test case consists of `n` and `m` such that `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - Reads `b` and `c` from input.
  - Checks if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even and if `b` is greater than or equal to `c`.
  - Prints 'Yes' if both conditions are met; otherwise, prints 'No'.

This revised program correctly handles all the edge cases and ensures that the logic aligns with the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation

**Final: True**

The given program, after the corrections, is now correct and accurately determines whether it is possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
