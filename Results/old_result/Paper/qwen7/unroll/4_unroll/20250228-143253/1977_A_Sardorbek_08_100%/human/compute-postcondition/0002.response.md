Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines printed during the loop's execution, each line containing either 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration where `b` and `c` are the integers provided by the user input. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `a`, which is specified at the start of the loop. Each line corresponds to one iteration of the loop, with the conditions checked using the current values of `b` and `c`.
