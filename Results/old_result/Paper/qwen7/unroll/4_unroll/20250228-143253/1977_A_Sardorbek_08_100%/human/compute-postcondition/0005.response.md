Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `b` and `c`. It prints one of four possible responses ('YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No') for each test case based on the relationship between `b` and `c`. If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the console output by printing the results of each test case.**
