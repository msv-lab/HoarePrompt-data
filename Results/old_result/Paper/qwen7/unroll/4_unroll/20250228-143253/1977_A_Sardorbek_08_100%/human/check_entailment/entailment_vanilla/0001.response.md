Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** `b == c`
     - If the number of moves (`b`) is equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), it prints 'YES'.
   - **Condition 2:** `b < c`
     - If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not possible to have more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This condition checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes. If they match, it prints 'Yes'. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine the possibility.
   - **Else Condition:** If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Condition 1:** `b == c` is correct. If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to achieve the desired state.
- **Condition 2:** `b < c` is incorrect. It's impossible to have more cubes than moves, so this condition should never be true.
- **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2` is partially correct but insufficient. It correctly identifies whether the number of moves and cubes have the same parity, but it does not fully account for the possibility of achieving the desired number of cubes through a series of additions and subtractions.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to check if `c` can be expressed as `b + k` where `k` is even (since each move adds or removes 1 cube).

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0 and b >= c:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

- **Condition 1:** `abs(b - c) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.
- **Condition 2:** `b >= c` ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the desired number of cubes.

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors and does not fully address the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
