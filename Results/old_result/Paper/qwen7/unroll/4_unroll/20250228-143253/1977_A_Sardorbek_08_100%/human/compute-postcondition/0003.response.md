Output State: **The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 0 to a-1. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the input values provided for 'b' and 'c' in each iteration.**

This means that for each line of input (where `b` and `c` are read), the program will print one of the four possible messages ('YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No') according to the conditions specified in the loop. The exact sequence of these messages will depend on the values of `b` and `c` entered during each iteration of the loop.
