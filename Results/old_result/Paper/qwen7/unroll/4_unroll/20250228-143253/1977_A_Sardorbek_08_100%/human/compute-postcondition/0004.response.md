Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `t` (the number of test cases) is also a positive integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between `n` and `m`.**
