Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Condition for 'YES':** The condition `if b == c:` is correct, and it should print 'YES'.
2. **Condition for 'NO':** The condition `elif b < c:` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `elif b < c:` which means the number of moves `b` is less than the number of cubes `c`, making it impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.
3. **Condition for 'Yes':** The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is partially correct but not sufficient. This condition checks if the number of moves `b` and the desired number of cubes `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd). However, it also needs to ensure that `b >= c` because you cannot have more cubes than moves. If `b` is even and `c` is odd, or vice versa, and `b < c`, it should print 'NO'.
4. **Condition for 'No':** The final condition `else:` is redundant and incorrect because it does not cover all cases. It should be combined with the previous conditions to handle all cases properly.

Given these issues, the annotated program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
