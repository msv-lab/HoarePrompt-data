### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with \( n \) parts using \( m \) colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most \( k \) parts to the same color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Key Conditions for "YES":**
   - Alice needs to ensure that no single color appears more than \( k \) times. If this is not possible, Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `if n <= k`: If \( n \leq k \), Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
     - `if n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the maximum number of parts painted with the same color (which is \( \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \)) is less than \( k \). If true, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'Yes'.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is indeed correct for determining if Bob can make all parts the same color. If the maximum number of parts painted with the same color is less than \( k \), then Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.
   - The condition `if n <= k` is also correct for ensuring that if \( n \leq k \), Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.

5. **Correct Condition:**
   - The original code correctly uses the condition `if n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to determine if Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.

6. **Corrected Code:**
   - The provided code already correctly implements the logic to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original code is correct because it properly checks if Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. The conditions used in the code are accurate and sufficient to determine the outcome.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
