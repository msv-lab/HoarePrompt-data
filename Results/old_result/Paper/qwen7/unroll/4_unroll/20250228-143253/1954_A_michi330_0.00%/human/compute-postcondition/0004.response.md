Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes three integers t, n, and m, with constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50. For each test case, it returns information based on these integers.**

This means the function is designed to process a series of test cases, each containing three integers (t, n, m) under specified constraints. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters but uses them within its logic to produce the output.
