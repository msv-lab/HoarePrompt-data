Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific value input by the user. The conditions for `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unaltered as they are only defined within the context of each test case and not initialized in the given initial state.
