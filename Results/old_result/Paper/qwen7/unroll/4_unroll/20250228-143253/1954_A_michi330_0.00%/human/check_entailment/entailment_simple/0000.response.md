### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case with `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - If `n <= k`, it means Bob can repaint all parts, so Alice cannot prevent Bob from making all parts have the same color. Hence, the program prints 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`, it checks whether the number of parts that need to be painted differently than the majority color is less than `k`. If this condition is true, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. Hence, the program prints 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n > k`: This means Bob cannot repaint all parts. In this scenario, we need to check if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that even after Bob repainting up to `k` parts, not all parts will be the same color.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` ensures that even if Bob repaints `k` parts, there will still be at least one color that has more parts than the others, preventing Bob from making all parts the same color.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` correctly identifies when Alice can ensure that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. This is because `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color to ensure that no single color can dominate if Alice distributes the colors optimally.
   - The condition `n <= k` is correctly handled to return 'NO' when Bob can repaint all parts.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
