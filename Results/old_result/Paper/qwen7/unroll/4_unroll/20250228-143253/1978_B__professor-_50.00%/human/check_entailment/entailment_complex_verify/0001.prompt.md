You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:

        else:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop. The number of integers in the output state will be equal to the value of `t`. Each integer is calculated based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, following the conditions specified in the loop body.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the given conditions: if \( b \leq a \), it prints \( n \times a \); if \( b - a \geq n \), it prints the sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( 2b - n + 1 \); otherwise, it prints the sum of an arithmetic sequence from \( a \) to \( b - a \) plus \( a \times n \). The function outputs a series of integers, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `b` is less than or equal to `a`. If true, it prints `n * a` because the best strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, it further checks if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`. If true, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`.
   - Otherwise, it uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` to calculate the profit.

3. **Formulas Explanation:**
   - When `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the profit is calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - n + 1`. This is derived from the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence.
   - When `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the profit is calculated by considering the first `k` buns sold at the modified price and the rest at the usual price.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - Output: `17`
   - Here, `b - a = 1` which is less than `n = 4`. So, the optimal choice is to sell the first `k = 1` bun at `5` coins and the rest at `4` coins each. Thus, the profit is `5 + 4*3 = 17`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - Output: `35`
   - Here, `b - a = 4` which is greater than `n = 5`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 5 buns at the modified prices, giving a profit of `9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 = 35`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - Output: `100`
   - Here, `b - a = 5` which is greater than `n = 10`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 10 buns at the usual price, giving a profit of `10 * 10 = 100`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - Output: `45`
   - Here, `b - a = 6` which is greater than `n = 5`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 5 buns at the modified prices, giving a profit of `11 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 7 = 45`.

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Here, `b = a`, so the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - Output: `1000000000000000000`
   - Here, `b - a = 999999999` which is much greater than `n = 1000000000`. So, the optimal choice is to sell all 1000000000 buns at the modified price, giving a profit of `1000000000 * 1 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - Output: `500500`
   - Here, `b - a = 999` which is less than `n = 1000`. So, the optimal choice is to sell the first `k = 999` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price, giving a profit of `999 + 998 + ... + 2 + 1 + 1000 * (1000 - 999) = 500500`.

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the profit based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
