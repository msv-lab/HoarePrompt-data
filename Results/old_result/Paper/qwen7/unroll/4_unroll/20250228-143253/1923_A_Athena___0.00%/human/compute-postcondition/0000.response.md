Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, the new value of `t` is an integer that falls within this range, and it is the integer input by the user. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
