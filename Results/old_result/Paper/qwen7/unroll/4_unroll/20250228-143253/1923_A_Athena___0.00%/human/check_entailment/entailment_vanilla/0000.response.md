### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block with no free cells in between. The provided solution does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, the current implementation removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not solve the problem as stated.

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code removes leading zeros using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It then removes trailing zeros using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - Finally, it counts the number of zeros in the modified list and prints it.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - Removing leading and trailing zeros does not ensure that the chips are moved to form a single block.
   - Counting the number of zeros in the list does not give the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the desired configuration.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left.
   - We should keep track of the number of operations required to move each chip to its final position in the block.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
