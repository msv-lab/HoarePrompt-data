### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block with no free cells in between. The provided solution does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, the current implementation removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the number of zeros remaining, which does not solve the problem as stated.

2. **Current Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code removes leading zeros using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)`.
   - It then removes trailing zeros using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`.
   - Finally, it counts the number of zeros in the list and prints it.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - Removing leading and trailing zeros does not ensure that the chips are moved to form a single block.
   - Counting the number of zeros in the list does not give the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the desired configuration.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the left.
   - We should keep track of the number of operations required to move each chip to its final position in the block.

Given the function summary, the function does not actually perform the necessary operations to solve the problem. It simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which is not the correct approach. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described.
