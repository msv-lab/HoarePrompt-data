Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. The current implementation reads a single integer `x` at the beginning and then processes `x` test cases within the loop, which is incorrect. It should read the number of test cases `t` first and then process each test case individually. Here's an example that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
3
5 3
7 2
1 9
```

Expected Output:
```
3 5
2 7
1 9
```

Actual Output (with the given program):
```
3 5
2 7
9 1
```

The program does not correctly handle multiple test cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
