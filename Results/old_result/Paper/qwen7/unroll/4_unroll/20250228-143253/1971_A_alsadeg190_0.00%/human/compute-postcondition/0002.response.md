Output State: The values of `x` and `y` printed in each iteration depend on user input for that iteration. After all iterations, these printed pairs will be the final output state. Since the initial value of `t` (number of iterations) and the values of `x` and `y` for each iteration are determined by user input, the exact output state cannot be precisely calculated without knowing the specific inputs provided during each iteration.
