Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Current state**: The state right before the loop is `num_tests` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_tests} \leq 1000\).
3. **Determine the adjustment needed**: For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must satisfy the condition `num_tests > 0`.

Given that `num_tests` is already constrained between 1 and 1000, it inherently satisfies the condition `num_tests > 0`. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary.

**Conclusion**: The current state already ensures that the loop can execute at least once.

**Answer**:
State: **`num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000**
