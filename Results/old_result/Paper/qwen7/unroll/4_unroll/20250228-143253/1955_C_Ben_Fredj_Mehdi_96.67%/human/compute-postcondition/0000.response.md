Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer value of input().**

This means that the initial value of `t` was a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4], and now `t` has been updated to the integer value obtained from the input. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
