The function processes a series of test cases defined by the number of tests `t`. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. Based on the value of `k` relative to `n-1`, it outputs either "1" or "n-1". The final state of the program consists of `t` lines of output, each containing either "1" or "n-1" depending on the condition met by `k` for each test case.
