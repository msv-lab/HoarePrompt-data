Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than just island 1. Specifically, if `k < n-1`, Everule can visit all islands except the one that would be isolated by the destruction of the bridges. 

Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
2 1
```
- Expected Output:
```
2
```
- Actual Output from the program:
```
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2`. This happens because the condition `if k >= n - 1` is not sufficient to cover all scenarios. When `k < n - 1`, the correct approach is to calculate how many groups of disconnected islands can be formed and ensure that Everule can still visit all but one island.

A corrected version of the program could be:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum number of islands Everule can visit
            min_islands = n - math.ceil(k / (n - 1))
            print(min_islands)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly.
