Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win, which happens when the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
2. The given solution calculates the number of pairs (or nearly pairs) that can be formed from the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. Specifically, it uses the formula \(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + \text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\).
3. Let's break down the formula:
   - \(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2\) counts the number of complete pairs of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - \(\text{int}(a \% 2 + b \% 2 + c \% 2 == 3)\) checks if the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s modulo 2 equals 3, which means there are three odd counts among 1s, 2s, and 3s. In this case, one more pair can be formed, hence the addition of 1.
4. The logic behind the formula is correct because:
   - Pairs of 1s, 2s, and 3s can be used to form pairs that will cancel out their contributions to the XOR result.
   - If the sum of the remainders of 1s, 2s, and 3s modulo 2 equals 3, it means there are three odd counts, and one more pair can be formed to ensure the XOR result remains zero.
5. The function correctly processes each test case and prints the result for each case, ensuring the overall output is the sum of these results.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
