Output State: **`index` is 2, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is an empty list, n and q are not yet defined, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`index`, `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, and `a`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain as they were in the initial state.
