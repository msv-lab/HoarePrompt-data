Output State: `index` is 6 + t * 3, `t` is the number of iterations of the outer loop, `results` is a list containing the outcomes of all queries based on the given conditions, `data` is the original list of strings, `n` and `q` are the values read from the `data` list during each iteration of the outer loop, `a` is a list of n integers initialized to zero, `pf` is a prefix XOR array, and `mp` is a dictionary mapping prefix XOR values to their indices.
