Output State: **`l` is 0, `r` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `l` and `r`. Variable `l` is assigned the value 0, and variable `r` is assigned the value of the length of the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` as a list of integers and the predicate function remains unchanged.
