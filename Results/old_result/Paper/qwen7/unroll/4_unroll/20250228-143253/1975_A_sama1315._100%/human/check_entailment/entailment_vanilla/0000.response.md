Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an array `a` as input.
   - It first calculates the length of the array `n`.
   - It sorts the array `a` to get `sorted_a`.
   - It then creates a new array `concatenated_a` by concatenating `a` with itself.
   - It checks if there exists a subarray in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`.
   - If such a subarray is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the total number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_1` to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints all the results joined by newline characters.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Logic**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if any subarray of `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`. However, this does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.
- **Example**: Consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. Concatenating and checking subarrays will not help because the array cannot be split and swapped to become non-decreasing.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **Reading Input**: The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
- **Calling `func_1`**: However, as discussed, `func_1` is incorrect and may return false positives or false negatives.

### Conclusion

Given that `func_1` is fundamentally flawed and cannot correctly determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
