Output State: **idx is 2 + t, t is an integer equal to int(data[0]), results is a list containing t elements where each element is the result of calling func_1 on a list of integers.**

To break it down:
- The variable `idx` starts at 2 and increases by `n` for each iteration of the loop, so after `t` iterations, `idx` will be `2 + t`.
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is only initialized and not modified within the loop.
- The variable `results` will contain `t` elements, each being the result of calling `func_1` on a list of integers `a`.
