Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `sys.stdin.read` (which is assigned to `input`), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to `data`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `input` is updated to refer to `sys.stdin.read`.
