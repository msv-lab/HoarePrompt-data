Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)
- Expected Output: `-1` (since it's impossible to pair all extroverts with universals)

However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not account for this scenario properly. Let's break down the issue:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
       if extroverts % 3 != 0:
           if extroverts % 3 + universals < 3:
               return None
       return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
   ```
   This function checks if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals but does not handle the case where there are too many extroverts and not enough universals to pair with.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   ```python
   def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
       ret = func_1(extroverts, universals)
       return -1 if ret is None else introverts + ret
   ```
   This function uses the result from `func_1` to determine the total number of tents needed. However, it does not handle the case where `func_1` returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to pair all extroverts with universals.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles cases where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    pairs = min(extroverts, universals // 2)
    remaining_extroverts = extroverts - pairs
    remaining_universals = universals - pairs * 2
    return ceil((remaining_extroverts + remaining_universals) / 3)

def func_2(introverts: int, extroverts: int, universals: int) -> int:
    tents_for_extroverts = func_1(extroverts, universals)
    return -1 if tents_for_extroverts is None else introverts + tents_for_extroverts
```

With these corrections, the program should handle all cases correctly.
