Output State: **introverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of introverts, extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals, ret is the return value of func_1(extroverts, universals)**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments. The function call returns a value, which is assigned to the variable `ret`. The values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` remain unchanged from their initial state.
