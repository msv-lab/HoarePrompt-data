Output State: **The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3.**

Given the initial conditions:
- `extroverts` is a non-negative integer.
- `universals` is a non-negative integer.
- The condition `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3` holds true.

The code snippet `return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` calculates the ceiling value of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` divided by 3. Since both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers and the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3` is true, the expression `(extroverts + universals) / 3` will yield a value that, when rounded up, gives the required output.
