Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function takes two parameters: `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - It checks if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3. If so, it further checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals` is at least 3.
   - If the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3` is met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
   - If the condition is not met, it returns `None`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and stores the result in `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

3. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate introverts, extroverts, and universals according to their preferences.
   - Introverts need individual tents.
   - Extroverts need to share tents with two others.
   - Universals can share tents with any number of others.
   - The solution should handle edge cases where it's impossible to accommodate everyone.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, it's impossible to form complete groups of 3 for extroverts, hence the function returns `None`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` correctly returns `-1`.

5. **Function Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the calculation of the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the addition of introverts' tents and returns `-1` when necessary.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. They handle all edge cases appropriately and produce the correct results based on the input.

Correctness: **True**
