Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), a (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and b (a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a value based on specific conditions involving these parameters.**
