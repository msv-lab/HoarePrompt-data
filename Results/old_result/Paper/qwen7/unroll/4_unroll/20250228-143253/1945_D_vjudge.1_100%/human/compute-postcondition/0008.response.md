Output State: `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for `0 ≤ i < n`, `suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`, `ans` is the minimum value among `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for `0 ≤ i < k`.
