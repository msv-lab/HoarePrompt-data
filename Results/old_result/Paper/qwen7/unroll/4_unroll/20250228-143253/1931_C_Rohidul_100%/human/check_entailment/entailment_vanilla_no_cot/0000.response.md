Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Operation Understanding**: The problem allows you to change any subarray to a single value at a cost of \((j - i + 1)\) burles. The goal is to make all elements of the array equal with the minimum cost.

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation only checks the first and last elements and tries to minimize the length of the array that needs to be changed. This approach is insufficient because it doesn't consider all possible subarrays that could be used to make the entire array uniform.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, you should:
   - Identify the most frequent element in the array.
   - Calculate the cost of changing all elements to this most frequent element using the optimal subarray operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = Counter(a)
        
        # Find the most common element
        most_common_element, _ = freq.most_common(1)[0]
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most common element
        min_cost = 0
        start = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != most_common_element:
                min_cost += i - start
                start = i + 1
        min_cost += n - start
        
        print(min_cost)

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Counts the frequency of each element in the array.
- Identifies the most common element.
- Calculates the minimum cost required to make all elements equal to this most common element by counting the number of changes needed, which corresponds to the sum of the lengths of segments where the elements are different from the most common element.
