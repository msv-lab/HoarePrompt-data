Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `t`, `n`, and the array `a` for each test case.
2. **Segment Identification**: The program identifies segments of the array where consecutive elements are the same. This is done using two while loops that incrementally adjust the left (`l`) and right (`r`) pointers until they reach a different element or the boundaries of the array.
3. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of making all elements in a segment equal is calculated as the length of the segment minus the maximum length of any segment identified at the start or end of the array. This logic is implemented correctly in the lines:
   ```python
   ans = le - max(st, end)
   ```
   and
   ```python
   ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
   ```
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the entire array might already be uniform (e.g., `a[0] == a[-1]`), which is correctly accounted for in the conditional block.
5. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated cost for each test case, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation.

Correctness: **True**
