### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variable `mn` is initialized to 100 but is not used anywhere in the code. This is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the program's correctness.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - For the "STAIR" condition (`a < b < c`), the program checks this correctly.
   - For the "PEAK" condition (`a < b > c`), the program also checks this correctly.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE", which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case based on the conditions checked.

5. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates `q` times, where `q` is the number of test cases, ensuring all test cases are processed.

Given these points, the program logic is correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
