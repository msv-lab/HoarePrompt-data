You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of q lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' based on the conditions evaluated for each set of inputs (a, b, c) provided by the user during the loop iterations. The initial values of `t`, `q`, and `mn` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair or a peak. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly implemented. The program uses a single `if` statement for each condition without proper nesting, which means it will always print "STAIR" or "PEAK" based on the first condition met, regardless of the other condition. This leads to incorrect outputs for some cases.

For example, consider the input `1 5 3`. According to the problem description, this should be classified as a "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify it as "STAIR" because the first condition `a < b < c` is not met, but the second condition `a < b > c` is not checked properly due to the lack of proper nesting.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks both conditions and handles them correctly.
