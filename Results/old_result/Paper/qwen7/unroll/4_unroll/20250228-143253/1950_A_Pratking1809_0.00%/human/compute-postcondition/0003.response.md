Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `q`.
2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**: 
   - The loop `for i in range(q):` will execute as long as `q` is a positive integer.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `q`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `q` is an input integer.
- `mn` is 100.

For the loop to execute, `q` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1). The value of `t` and `mn` do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `q` must be a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).

Since `i` will start from 0, it doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` must be a positive integer, `mn` is 100, `i` is 0**
