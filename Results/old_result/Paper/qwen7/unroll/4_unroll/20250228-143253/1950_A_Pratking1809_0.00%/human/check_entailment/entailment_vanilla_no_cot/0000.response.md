Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly handle the conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak. Specifically, the variables `mn` and its usage are unnecessary and do not contribute to solving the problem. Additionally, the logic for checking the conditions should be combined into a single block to avoid redundant checks. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version directly checks the conditions for a stair and a peak within the same loop and prints the appropriate result without any unnecessary variables.
