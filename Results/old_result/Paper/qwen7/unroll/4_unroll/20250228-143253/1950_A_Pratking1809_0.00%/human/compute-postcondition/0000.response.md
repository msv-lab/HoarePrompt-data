Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `q` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The variable `q` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means it will take an integer input from the user. The value of `t` remains unchanged as the input does not affect `t`. Therefore, `t` still holds the value such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `q` now holds the input integer.
