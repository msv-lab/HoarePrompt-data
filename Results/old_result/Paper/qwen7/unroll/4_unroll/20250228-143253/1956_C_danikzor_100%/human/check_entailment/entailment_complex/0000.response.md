Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements using at most 2n operations.
2. The provided code snippet does not match the problem's requirements in several ways:
   - The function `func_1()` is called without any input processing, which means it will not handle the actual test cases as specified.
   - The formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot n - 1)}{6} \) is printed, but this is not the correct approach to maximize the sum of the matrix.
   - The permutations used in the operations are not correctly described to achieve the maximum sum.

Given these discrepancies, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
