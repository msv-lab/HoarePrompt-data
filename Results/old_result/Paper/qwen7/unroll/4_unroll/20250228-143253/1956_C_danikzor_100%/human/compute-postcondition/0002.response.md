Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The variable `i` is initialized to 1 within the loop (`for i in range(1, n + 1)`).
   - The variable `n` is an input integer.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the initial value of `n` must be such that the loop can start.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be at least 1. Given that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), `n` can take any value from 1 to 500. However, to ensure the loop starts, `n` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be at least 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` must be at least 1**
