Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving two integers \( t \) and \( n \) where \( 1 \leq t \leq 500 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific mathematical expression \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot n - 1)}{6} \) and \( 2 \cdot n \). It then prints \( 2 \cdot n \) lines, each starting with either 1 or 2, followed by an integer \( i \) (where \( 1 \leq i \leq n \)), and the numbers from \( n \) down to 1 in descending order. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
