Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
- The provided program does not actually perform the required operations on the matrix. Instead, it prints a mathematical expression and a series of operations that do not align with the problem's requirements.
- Specifically, the printed values are not derived from the actual matrix transformations described in the problem statement. The expression \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4 \cdot n - 1)}{6} \) does not correspond to the sum of the matrix after performing the allowed operations.
- The operations printed (both starting with `1` and `2`) simply print numbers from \( n \) down to 1, which does not represent a permutation of the rows or columns as required.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
