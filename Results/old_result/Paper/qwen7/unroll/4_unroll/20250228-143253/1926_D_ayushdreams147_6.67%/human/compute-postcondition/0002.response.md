Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in a:`. Here, the objects involved are `num` and `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num`: This variable will take on each value from the list `a` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `a`: This is a list of `n` non-negative integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Once `a` is exhausted (i.e., becomes empty), the loop will terminate.

4. **Adjust the state based on the loop condition**:
   - Since the loop depends on the list `a` having elements, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `num` will be assigned the first element of `a` when the loop starts its first iteration.

5. **Consider the given initial state**:
   - `res` is 0 (though this is not directly related to the loop execution).
   - `n` is a positive integer (though this is not directly related to the loop execution).
   - `count` is an empty dictionary (though this is not directly related to the loop execution).

Given the above analysis, the only states that need to be adjusted are those involving `num` and `a`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
- `a` must have at least one element.
- `num` will be assigned the first element of `a` when the loop starts its first iteration.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`a` must have at least one element, num is the first element of `a`**
