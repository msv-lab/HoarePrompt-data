Output State: `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, `n` is the original length of the list `a`, `a` is the original list of `n` non-negative integers, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` after the bitwise operation and the value is the difference between its original frequency and the frequency after applying the operation. If an element appears an even number of times, its value in the dictionary will be zero or negative; if it appears an odd number of times, its value will be positive.
