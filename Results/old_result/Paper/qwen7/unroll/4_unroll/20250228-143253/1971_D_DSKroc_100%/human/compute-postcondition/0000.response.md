Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and this value is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 500, inclusive. All other conditions and constraints on `s` remain unchanged.
