The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each string `s`, it counts the number of positions where consecutive characters differ. If the string is non-decreasing, it adds one to this count before printing it; otherwise, it prints the count as is. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results and resets the count and flag variables for each new string.
