Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are replaced by the first three integers from input converted to integers, L is a list containing these three integers.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list `L`. The variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are replaced by the first three integers from the input. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
