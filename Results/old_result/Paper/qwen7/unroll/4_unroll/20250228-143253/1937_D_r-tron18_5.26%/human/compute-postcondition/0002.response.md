Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of every occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of accumulated sums starting from 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state includes `totalOne` being equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` being a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `pre` being a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of every occurrence of '>' in `s1`.
- The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` by accumulating the elements of `pre` with an initial value of 0. This means each element in `preOne` is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` up to that point, including the initial value of 0.
- Since the exact values of `pre` are not given, we can only describe `preOne` in terms of its relationship to `pre`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated definition of `preOne` as described.
