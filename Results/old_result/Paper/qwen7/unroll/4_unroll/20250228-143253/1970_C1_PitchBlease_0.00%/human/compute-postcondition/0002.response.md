The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `queue` must not be empty.

Since `queue` already contains the tuple `(start, 0)`, it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices, `visited` is a set containing `start`**
