Reasoning:
- The program is structured to handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3()`, which converts the input into integers.
- It then iterates through `m` moves, reading each move's distance `r` and direction `c` using `func_1()`. The direction is processed to update the possible positions of the ball.
- The logic within `func_4()` correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise moves, updating the set of possible positions for the ball.
- If the position `0` is in the set of possible positions, it is adjusted to `n` to ensure the positions are within the valid range.
- The final output correctly prints the number of unique possible positions and the positions themselves in sorted order.

Given the provided problem description and the execution summary, the implementation in `func_4()` accurately reflects the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
