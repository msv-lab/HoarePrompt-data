Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and the function `func_3()` has been called to assign values to `n`, `m`, and `x`.**

The code `n, m, x = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which returns three values. These values are assigned to `n`, `m`, and `x` respectively. Since the exact values returned by `func_3()` are not specified, we keep the constraints on these variables as given in the initial state.
