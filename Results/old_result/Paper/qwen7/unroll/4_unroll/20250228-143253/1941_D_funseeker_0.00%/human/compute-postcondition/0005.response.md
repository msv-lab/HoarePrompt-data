Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all possible positions the ball can be at after `m` throws, except for position 0.**

The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the value 0 from the set `ans`. Since the initial state includes that 0 was present in the set `ans`, after executing the code, 0 is no longer in the set. All other information about the set `ans` remains unchanged.
