Functionality: **The function calculates all possible positions of a ball after a given number of throws among a specified number of players. It starts with an initial player holding the ball and updates the possible positions based on the distance and direction of each throw. If position 0 is among the possible positions, it is replaced with position `n`. Finally, it prints the count of unique possible positions and lists those positions.**
