Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. It checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even and `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it attempts to find integers `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` equals `p2 - y` and `p3`. If such integers exist, it prints `p1 - x + p3`; otherwise, it prints `p3`. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of integers or `-1` based on the conditions described.**
