Reasoning:
The annotated program seems to follow the problem statement closely. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it correctly prints `-1` because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring system where each game results in either 2 points for one player and 0 for the other, or 1 point for each player in a draw.

3. **Condition Check for Maximum Draws**:
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program directly prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws would be when the third player wins all games, which would mean the first two players split their games evenly.
   - If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the program attempts to find integers `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x = p2 - y` and `p1 - x + p3` represents the total points. This logic aims to maximize the number of draws. However, the implementation has some issues:
     - The logic for finding `x` and `y` might not always yield the correct maximum number of draws. Specifically, the loop condition `y >= x` might not handle all edge cases properly.
     - The logic assumes that the difference between `p1` and `p2` can be balanced by drawing games, but it doesn’t fully account for all possible configurations of games and draws.

4. **Output Handling**: The program outputs the calculated value or `-1` for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program does not fully address all edge cases and might not always provide the correct maximum number of draws. Therefore, the program is not entirely correct.

Correctness: **False**
