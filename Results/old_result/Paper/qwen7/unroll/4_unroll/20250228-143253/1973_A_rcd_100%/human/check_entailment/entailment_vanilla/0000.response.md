Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which denotes the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules.
   - This check is correct since the sum of points must be even for the given scoring system (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw).

3. **Initial Check for Maximum Possible Draws:**
   - The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This check is incorrect. According to the problem, `p3` should be the highest score, but this condition does not necessarily mean that the maximum number of draws can be achieved. We need to consider the distribution of wins and draws more carefully.

4. **Finding Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It initializes `x` and `y` such that `x` represents the number of draws where the first player loses and `y` represents the number of draws where the second player loses.
   - The loop continues until `y < x`, and within the loop, it adjusts `x` and `y` to maximize the number of draws.
   - If `p1 - x <= p2 - y`, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it increments `x` and decrements `y`.

### Issues in the Program:
- The initial check `if p3 >= p1 + p2:` is incorrect because it doesn't account for the distribution of wins and draws correctly.
- The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the distribution of wins and draws to maximize the number of draws.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
1. Ensure the total points are even.
2. Distribute the points such that the maximum number of draws is maximized.
3. Handle cases where no valid distribution exists.

### Revised Program:
Here is a revised version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Initialize variables
        max_draws = 0
        for i in range(p1 + 1):
            for j in range(p2 + 1):
                k = p3 - (i + j)
                if i + j + k == p1 + p2 + p3 // 2:
                    max_draws = max(max_draws, i + j)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors in determining the maximum number of draws. The revised program ensures the correct distribution of points and calculates the maximum number of draws accurately.

**Correctness: False**
