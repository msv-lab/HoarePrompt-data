The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( a_i \). For each test case, it determines whether a specific value (the \( f \)-th element in the list) will be removed exactly as many times as it appears in the original list when the list is sorted in descending order and the first \( k \) elements are considered. If the count of the specific value matches its frequency in the original list, it outputs 'YES'; if the specific value never gets removed, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'MAYBE'. The function implicitly accepts the number of test cases \( t \) as input and returns no explicit value but prints the result for each test case.
