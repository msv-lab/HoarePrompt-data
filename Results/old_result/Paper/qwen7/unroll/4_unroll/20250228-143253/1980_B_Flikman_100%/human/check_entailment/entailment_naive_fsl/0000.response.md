Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines whether the favorite cube will be removed in certain scenarios.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this case, the favorite cube (with value 3) is initially at index 1. After sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The first two elements are removed, but the favorite cube still remains in the array. The program incorrectly counts the occurrences of the favorite cube's value in the sorted array and compares it with the number of removed cubes, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program should check if the favorite cube is within the first `k` positions after sorting, rather than comparing the counts directly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        if sorted_a[k - 1] == favorite_value:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO' if sorted_a[k] != favorite_value else 'MAYBE')
```

This corrected version checks if the favorite cube's value is in the first `k` positions after sorting, which aligns with the problem description.
