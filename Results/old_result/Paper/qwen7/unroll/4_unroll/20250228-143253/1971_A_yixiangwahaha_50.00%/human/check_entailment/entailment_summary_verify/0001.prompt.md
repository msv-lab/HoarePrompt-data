You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then compares the corresponding elements of `x` and `y` and prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. If the element in `x` is less than the corresponding element in `y`, it prints the element from `x` followed by the element from `y`. Otherwise, it prints the element from `y` followed by the element from `x`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The problem states that the first line contains an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. However, the provided code does not read this value correctly. Instead, it reads a string from input and iterates 10 times regardless of the actual value of `t`.

2. **Loop Iteration**: The loop runs 10 times (`for i in range(10)`), but the problem specifies that the number of test cases is given by `t`. This means the loop should run `t` times, not 10 times.

3. **Reading Input**: Inside the loop, the code reads pairs of integers and appends them to lists `x` and `y`. This part is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Output Logic**: The logic inside the loop correctly prints the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers. However, since the loop runs 10 times instead of `t` times, it will process more data than necessary if `t` is less than 10, or fewer data points if `t` is greater than 10.

5. **Correct Implementation**: To fix this, the loop should be adjusted to run exactly `t` times, reading the values of `x` and `y` for each test case and printing the results accordingly.

### Conclusion:

Given the current implementation, the program is incorrect because it processes a fixed number of test cases (10) instead of the number of test cases specified in the input (`t`). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: False**
