Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `t` is now the integer value entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid, and now `t` holds the specific integer value entered by the user within this range.
