Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.
3. The logic for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is implemented as follows:
   - If `m < a` or `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2. This is because the condition ensures that the first and last firework from each installation do not overlap within the visibility period `m`.
   - Otherwise, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Here, `m // a` gives the number of firework launches from the first installation within the visibility period, `m // b` gives the number from the second installation, and `+2` accounts for the possibility of simultaneous launches from both installations.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
