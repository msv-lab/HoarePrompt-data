Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the scores do not allow for any valid set of games and results. 

For example, consider the input `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be consistent with a valid set of games. However, the current implementation does not check if the scores are logically consistent. For instance, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, it is impossible to achieve these scores through any combination of wins, losses, and draws, as the maximum score a player can achieve without any draws is 2 (from winning one game). Therefore, the output should be `-1` for this case, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that the scores are logically consistent before attempting to calculate the maximum number of draws.
