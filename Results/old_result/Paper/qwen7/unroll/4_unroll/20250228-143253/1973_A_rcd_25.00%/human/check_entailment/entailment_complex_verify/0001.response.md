### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points split between two players).

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The original assessment incorrectly states that if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. The correct logic should consider the maximum possible number of draws.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The original assessment mentions a binary search approach to find the maximum number of draws. However, the implementation details are not clear, and the logic might not handle all edge cases correctly.

5. **Breaking Conditions:**
   - The original assessment states that if the current number of draws (`cur`) satisfies the condition where `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`. This logic seems overly complex and might not be correct.

### Issues Identified:
- The initial condition check (`if p3 >= p1 + p2`) is incorrect. This condition does not necessarily mean that no draws are possible.
- The binary search logic is overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.
- The program does not properly account for the maximum number of draws that can occur.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- Calculate the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores.
- Determine the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring the total points are consistent.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games needed
        min_games = (total_points - 2 * p3) // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2) - min_games
        
        # Ensure the maximum number of draws is non-negative
        max_draws = max(0, max_draws)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Total Points Check:** The program first checks if the total points are even. If not, it prints `-1`.
- **Minimum Games Calculation:** It calculates the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation:** It calculates the maximum number of draws by considering the differences between the scores and the minimum number of games.
- **Non-Negative Draw Check:** It ensures that the calculated number of draws is non-negative.

### Conclusion:
The original program has several issues and does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The corrected program addresses these issues and provides the correct logic to find the maximum number of draws.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
