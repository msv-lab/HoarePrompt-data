### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, we need to output the number of stalls and their respective prices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall.
   - We need to ensure that the total number of jewels Alice buys equals `k`.
   - We need to check if it's possible to achieve this with the given constraints.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It defines a function `func_1` to handle the logic for each test case.
   - The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost for the first stall (`n - k + 1`) and the second stall (`1`). Then it checks if the sum of these stalls is sufficient to buy `k` jewels.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with the calculated prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the solution correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - **Case 2**: When `n < k`, the solution correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3**: When `n > k`, the solution calculates the prices for 2 stalls and checks if they can buy exactly `k` jewels. This part is logically sound but needs further validation.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic for calculating the prices and checking if they can buy exactly `k` jewels seems correct. However, the approach might not cover all edge cases. For example, it assumes that setting up 2 stalls is always sufficient, which might not be true in all scenarios.
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case where `n = 100` and `k = 50`. The function calculates the prices as `[51, 1]` and checks if the sum is sufficient. However, it does not consider other possible configurations of stalls that might also satisfy the condition.
   - For example, setting up stalls with prices `[2, 2, 2, ..., 2]` (25 times) would also allow Alice to buy exactly 50 jewels if `n >= 50`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code handles the basic cases correctly but may not cover all edge cases. Specifically, it assumes that setting up 2 stalls is always sufficient, which might not be true in all scenarios. There could be other configurations of stalls that also satisfy the condition.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
