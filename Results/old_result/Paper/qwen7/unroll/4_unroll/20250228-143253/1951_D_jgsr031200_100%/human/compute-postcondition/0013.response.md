Output State: `costs` is `[n - k + 1, 1]`, `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed, the variable `costs` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `h` is updated to be the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
