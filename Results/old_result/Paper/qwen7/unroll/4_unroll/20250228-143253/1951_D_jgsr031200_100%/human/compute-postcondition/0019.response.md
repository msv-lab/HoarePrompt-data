Output: **2**

Explanation:
- The initial state defines `costs` as a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
- `h` is defined as the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`. Since `costs` contains `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` will be `n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1`. 
- Given that `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, this information is used to validate the condition but does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `2`.

Therefore, the output is **2**.
