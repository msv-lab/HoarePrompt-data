You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the list \( a \) after performing specific operations (subtracting and adding elements based on indices). Finally, it prints the maximum sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This helps in prioritizing the largest elements for removal or negation.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation:**
   - The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of all elements in the sorted array.

4. **Negating Elements:**
   - The program iterates through the first `x` elements of the array and subtracts twice their value from `ans1`. This simulates Bob's optimal strategy of negating the smallest `x` elements.

5. **Removing Elements:**
   - The program then iterates through the first `k` elements of the array and adds their values to `ans1`. It also checks if the index `i + x` is within bounds and subtracts twice the value of `a[i + x]` from `ans1`. This simulates Alice's optimal strategy of removing the smallest `k` elements and considering the impact of Bob's negations.

6. **Finding the Maximum Sum:**
   - The program keeps track of the maximum value of `ans1` during the iterations and prints this value at the end.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array in descending order ensures that the largest elements are considered first for removal or negation, which aligns with the optimal strategies for both players.

2. **Negating Elements:**
   - Negating the smallest `x` elements is optimal for minimizing the sum, as these are the least impactful when negated.

3. **Removing Elements:**
   - Removing the smallest `k` elements is optimal for maximizing the sum, as these are the least impactful when removed.

4. **Combining Strategies:**
   - The program correctly combines both strategies by first considering Bob's negations and then Alice's removals, ensuring that the optimal sum is calculated.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` or `x` are equal to `n`, where Alice or Bob might remove or negate all elements.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the sum of the array after both players play optimally.
