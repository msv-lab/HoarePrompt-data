Output State: **After executing the loop for each test case, the value of `ans2` for each test case will be printed. `ans2` represents the maximum possible sum of the array `a` after performing the specified operations.**

In each iteration of the loop, the code processes the input values `n`, `k`, and `x`, sorts the array `a` in descending order, calculates `ans1` initially as the sum of the array, then modifies `ans1` based on the specified operations, and finally determines `ans2` as the maximum value between the current `ans1` and the previous `ans2`. The result `ans2` is printed at the end of each test case.
