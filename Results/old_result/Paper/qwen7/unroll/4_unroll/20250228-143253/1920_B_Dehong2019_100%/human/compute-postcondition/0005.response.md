Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the list \( a \) after performing specific operations (subtracting and adding elements based on indices). Finally, it prints the maximum sum for each test case.**
