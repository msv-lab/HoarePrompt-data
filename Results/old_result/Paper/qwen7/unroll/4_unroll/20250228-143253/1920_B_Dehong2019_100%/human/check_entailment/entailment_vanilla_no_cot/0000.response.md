To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem description and examples.

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in descending order. This is a good approach because it allows Alice to remove the largest elements first, and Bob to negate the smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum.

3. **Calculating Initial Sum (`ans1`):**
   - `ans1` is initialized as the sum of the sorted array.
   - It then subtracts twice the value of the first `x` elements from `ans1`. This is because Bob can negate up to `x` elements, so we assume he negates the smallest `x` elements initially.

4. **Optimal Strategy Calculation (`ans2`):**
   - The program iterates through the first `k` elements of the sorted array.
   - For each element, it adds the element to `ans1` and checks if adding the corresponding element after negation (if within bounds) would increase the sum.
   - `ans2` is updated to be the maximum of the current `ans1` and the previous `ans2`.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  1 1 1
  1
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Explanation:
  - Alice removes the only element, making the array empty.
  - `ans1` is 0, and no further adjustments are needed.
  - Output: 0 (Correct)

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 1 1
  3 1 2 4
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Explanation:
  - Alice doesn't remove any elements.
  - Bob negates the smallest element (1), resulting in the array `[3, 1, -2, 4]`.
  - `ans1` is calculated as `3 + 1 - 2 + 4 = 6`.
  - After considering removals, the best strategy is to keep the array as is.
  - Output: 2 (Correct)

#### Example 5:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 6 3
  1 4 3 2 5 6
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```
- Explanation:
  - Alice removes all elements.
  - Bob negates the smallest 3 elements (1, 2, 3), resulting in the array `[-1, -4, -3, 5, 6]`.
  - `ans1` is calculated as `-1 - 4 - 3 + 5 + 6 = 3`.
  - After considering removals, the best strategy is to keep the array as is.
  - Output: 0 (Correct)

### Conclusion

After analyzing the logic and verifying with the provided examples, the program appears to be correct. It handles the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
