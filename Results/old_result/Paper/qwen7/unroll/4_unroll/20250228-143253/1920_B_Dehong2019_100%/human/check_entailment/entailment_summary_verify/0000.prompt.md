You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    2 2 1
    
    4 3
    
    2 1 2
    
    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), \( x \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the list \( a \) after performing specific operations (subtracting and adding elements based on indices). Finally, it prints the maximum sum for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the scenario where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1 in an optimal way for all cases. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal strategy for both players to play simultaneously.

Let's analyze the provided solution:

1. The program sorts the array in descending order.
2. It calculates `ans1` by subtracting twice the smallest `x` elements from the total sum.
3. It then iterates through the first `k` elements, adding them to `ans1` and checking if removing the corresponding elements and multiplying others by -1 can yield a higher sum.

However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution. For example, consider the following input:

```
3 1 1
-1 2 -3
```

- Alice can remove the smallest element `-1`.
- Bob can then multiply the largest element `2` by `-1`.

The optimal strategy would be:
- Alice removes `-1`.
- Bob multiplies `2` by `-1`.

The resulting array would be `[-3]`, and the sum would be `-3`. However, the program calculates the sum as `2` because it does not properly account for the interaction between Alice's removal and Bob's multiplication.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases optimally, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.
