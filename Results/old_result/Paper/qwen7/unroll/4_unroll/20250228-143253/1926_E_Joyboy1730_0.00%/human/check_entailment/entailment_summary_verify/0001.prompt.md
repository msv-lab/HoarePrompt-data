You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        L = []
        while n:
            m = (n + 1) // 2
            n -= m
        tot = 0
        pow = 1
        for a in L:
            if tot < k and k <= tot + a:
                print(pow * (2 * k - 1))
                break
            tot += a
            k -= tot
            pow *= 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \), and prints this value. The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated values for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The variable `L` is initialized as an empty list.
   - The while loop `while n:` is intended to reduce `n` by half, but it does not serve any purpose in the context of the problem. This loop should be removed or modified.

3. **Initialization:**
   - Variables `tot` and `pow` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
   - The list `L` is used to store the counts of cards that can be laid down at each step. However, the list `L` is never populated with values in the given code.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The for loop iterates over the list `L`, which is empty, leading to an infinite loop because `L` is never populated.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`. Since `L` is empty, `a` will always be 0, making the condition `k <= tot + a` always false.
   - If the condition is met, it prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)`, which is supposed to be the k-th card. However, since `L` is never populated, this logic is flawed.

### Correctness Analysis

Given the analysis above, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. Specifically:

- The while loop `while n:` is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution.
- The list `L` is never populated with the correct values.
- The main logic inside the for loop is flawed due to the empty list `L`.

### Conclusion

Since the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the k-th card laid down by Vladislav, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
