Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and `n` is the length of the array, and `l` is 0, `r` is n.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value `0`, and `r` is assigned the value `n`. The initial state of `array` and `n` remains unchanged.
