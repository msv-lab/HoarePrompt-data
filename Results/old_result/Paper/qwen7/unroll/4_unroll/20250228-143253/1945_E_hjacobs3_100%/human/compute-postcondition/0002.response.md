Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `r` and `l`.
3. **Check the current values of these variables**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

4. **Evaluate the loop condition with the current values**:
   - The expression `r - l` becomes `n - 0 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n - 0 > 1` must be true, which means `n > 1`.

5. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since `l` is fixed at 0, no adjustment is needed for `l`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, and `n` must be greater than 1, and `l` is 0, `r` is n**
