Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 1000.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, after executing the code, `t` remains within this range but its specific value is now determined by the user's input. The other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state (such as `n` and `m` being defined later, and `a` being a string) remain unchanged.
