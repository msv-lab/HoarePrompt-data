Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex of a graph and then add edges between pairs of vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \). The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
   - It calls `make_array` to fill `arr` and `cliquess`.

3. **Analysis of `make_array`**:
   - `make_array` fills `arr` and `cliquess` based on the `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns values in a specific pattern to ensure the conditions for forming cliques are met.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach in `func_1` and `make_array` seems to follow a logical pattern to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The assignment of values in `arr` ensures that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied within each clique.
   - The `cliquess` array correctly assigns each vertex to a clique.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summaries, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem by ensuring the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques and providing the necessary output format.

Correctness: **True**
