Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter, and it starts from 0 and goes up to `not_mid - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `not_mid` must be at least 1 because if `not_mid` is 0, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0.
   - The value of `i` can be anything from 0 to `not_mid - 1`, but since we are only concerned with the initial state, we can set `i` to 0 (the starting point).

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`, and `not_mid` are all derived from the initial conditions and do not need to be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: `not_mid` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`not_mid` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**.
