Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n)` generates values from 0 to n-1).
   - `n` is given as a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute because `range(0)` generates no values.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, we don't need to change its value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`pos` is -1, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`**
