Output State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The line `pos = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `pos`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
