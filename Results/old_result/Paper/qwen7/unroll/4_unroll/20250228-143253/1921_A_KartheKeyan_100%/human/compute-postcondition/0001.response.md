Output State: **`n` is an input integer, t is 1, n is 0, l is an input integer, s is the sum of (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2 for each test case.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions that there are four lines of input representing the corners of a square, but since no further operations are performed on these inputs, they remain unchanged. The variable `t` is initialized to 1, and `n` is set to 0. The variable `l` is mentioned as an input integer, and `s` is defined as the sum of \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each test case. Since no test cases have been processed yet, `t` remains 1.
