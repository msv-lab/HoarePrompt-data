The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( s \). It then constructs a string \( r \) by mapping each integer in \( s \) to a corresponding character in a predefined string \( a \) (containing lowercase English letters), and updates a count list \( b \) accordingly. Finally, it prints the constructed string \( r \) for each test case.
