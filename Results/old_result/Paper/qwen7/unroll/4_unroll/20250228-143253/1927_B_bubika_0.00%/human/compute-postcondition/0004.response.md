Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; b is a list of 26 zeros; r is a string that is constructed based on the input lists s and a according to the given logic inside the loop. For each integer i in list s, the corresponding character from list a at index i is appended to r, and the count of i in list b is incremented.
