Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; b is a list of 26 zeros; r is a string constructed from concatenating elements of a based on the frequency count in b after processing all inputs.

In simpler terms:
Output State: t remains the same; n remains the same; a remains the same; b remains a list of 26 zeros; r is a string made by concatenating elements from list a according to how many times each element appears in list b after processing all inputs.
