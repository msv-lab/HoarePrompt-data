Output State: **`removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `pos` is an empty list, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`.**

The code calculates the sum of all elements in the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial state.
