Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` has hardcoded logic for the case where `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns 0. This hardcoded condition is not general and does not account for other possible values of `removals` and `negatives`.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 6 3
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```

The expected output should be calculated based on the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. However, the current implementation returns 0 due to the hardcoded condition, which is incorrect.

A correct approach would involve dynamically calculating the optimal strategy for both players based on the values of `removals` and `negatives`. The current implementation fails to do so.
