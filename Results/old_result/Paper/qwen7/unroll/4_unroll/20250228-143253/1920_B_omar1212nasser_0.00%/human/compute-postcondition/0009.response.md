Output State: `removals`: 0, `negatives`: 0, `elements`: original list, `pos`: [original `s` - 2 * original `n`], `s`: original sum of `elements`, `n`: original sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.

Explanation: The loop runs from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), but since `removals` is initially 0, the loop body is never executed. Therefore, none of the variables inside the loop are modified, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.
