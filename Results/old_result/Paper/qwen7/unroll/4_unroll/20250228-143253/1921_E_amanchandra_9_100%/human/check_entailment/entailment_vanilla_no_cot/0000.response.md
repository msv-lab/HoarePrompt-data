Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if a > c:` is not sufficient to determine the outcome. The correct approach should consider the relative positions and the possible moves of both players.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Moves**: The calculation of possible moves for Alice and Bob is not correctly implemented. The code attempts to calculate the range of possible moves but does not correctly determine whether a player can force a win or if the game will end in a draw.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The code does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when Alice or Bob is at the boundary of the board, which affects their possible moves.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Determine the vertical distance between Alice and Bob
        vertical_distance = abs(xa - xb)
        
        # Determine the horizontal distance between Alice and Bob
        horizontal_distance = abs(ya - yb)
        
        # If Alice is in the last row and Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
        if xa == h and xb == 1:
            print("Draw")
            continue
        
        # If Alice can reach Bob's position before Bob can reach Alice's position, Alice wins
        if vertical_distance % 2 == 0:
            if horizontal_distance <= vertical_distance:
                print("Alice")
            else:
                print("Draw")
        else:
            if horizontal_distance < vertical_distance:
                print("Alice")
            else:
                print("Draw")

func()
```

This corrected version checks the relative positions and distances between Alice and Bob to determine the outcome of the game more accurately.
