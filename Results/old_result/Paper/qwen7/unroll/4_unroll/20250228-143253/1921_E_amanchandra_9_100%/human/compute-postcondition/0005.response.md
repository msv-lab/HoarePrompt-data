Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). For each test case, it determines whether 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' should be printed based on the values of x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. Specifically, if x_a is greater than x_b, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a midpoint x and checks if the other coordinates fall within certain ranges with a specified tolerance. Depending on these checks, it prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each test case.**
