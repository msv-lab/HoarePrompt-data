Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for buying \(n\) yogurts given the prices for one and two yogurts. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Price Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it first checks if \(n > 1\). If true, it calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This represents the cost if each yogurt is bought individually at price \(a\).
     - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: This represents the cost if pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price \(b\) and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price \(a\).
   - It then prints the minimum of these two calculated values.
3. **Single Yogurt Case**: If \(n = 1\), it directly prints the price \(a\) since no promotion applies.
4. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the result for each test case on a new line, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program accurately computes the minimum cost for each test case based on the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
