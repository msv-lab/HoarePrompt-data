Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates the cost of buying `n` yogurts without any promotion (`ans1 = a * n`) and with the promotion (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
4. It prints the minimum of these two costs.
5. The logic handles both cases where `n` is greater than 1 and where `n` is 1.
6. The conditions and calculations align with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
