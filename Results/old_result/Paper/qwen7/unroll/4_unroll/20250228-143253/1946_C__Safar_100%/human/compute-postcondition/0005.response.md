Output State: **`c` is 0, `g` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, `l` is 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `1` to the variable `l`. The initial values of `c` and `g` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `l` and retains the original values of `c` and `g`.
