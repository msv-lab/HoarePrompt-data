Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and performs the required operations within the constraints.

1. **Matrix Initialization**: The program initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` with values ranging from 1 to \( n \) for each row. This ensures that the matrix is filled with the desired permutations for the first type of operation.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the matrix elements is calculated using the formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1)(2i + 1) \). This formula is derived from the structure of the matrix after applying the first type of operation.

3. **Operations Execution**: The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \). It then performs the operations in reverse order, ensuring that the matrix is correctly updated according to the problem statement.

4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the operations in the correct format, specifying the type of operation, the row or column index, and the permutation used.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified.
