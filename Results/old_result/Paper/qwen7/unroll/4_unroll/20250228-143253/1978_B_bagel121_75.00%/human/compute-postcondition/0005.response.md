Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic series, and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for `n - k` times. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each test case.**
