You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` based on the given formulae, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic series, and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for `n - k` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2`, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic series, and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for `n - k` times. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling any bun at a lower price would result in less profit.
     ```python
     if a >= b:
         print(n * a)
     ```

3. **Optimal Strategy for `a < b`:**
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the optimal strategy involves choosing an integer `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The modified price for the `i-th` bun (where `1 <= i <= k`) is `(b - i + 1)`.
   - The total profit from the first `k` buns is the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     \text{Profit from first } k \text{ buns} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - The profit from the remaining `n-k` buns is `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two parts:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \frac{k(2b - k + 1)}{2} + (n - k) * a
     \]

4. **Choosing `k`:**
   - The value of `k` should be chosen such that the total profit is maximized. The optimal `k` can be up to `b - a + 1` because beyond this point, the modified price would be non-positive, which is not feasible.
   - The program correctly sets `k` to `min(b - a + 1, n)` to ensure it does not exceed the number of buns available.
   - It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and adds the profit from the remaining buns.

### Correctness Verification

- The logic for handling the base case (`a >= b`) is correct.
- The formula for calculating the profit from the first `k` buns is correct and matches the arithmetic series sum.
- The choice of `k` is within the valid range and ensures the calculation is accurate.
- The final profit calculation combines both parts correctly.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
