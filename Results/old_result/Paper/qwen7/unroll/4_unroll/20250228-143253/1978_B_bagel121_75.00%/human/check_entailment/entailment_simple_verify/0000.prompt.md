You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` based on the given formulae, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic series, and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for `n - k` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the modified price (b - i + 1) could potentially yield a higher profit than the usual price (a) for the first few buns. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 3`, `a = 10`, `b = 15`

According to the problem description, Bob should choose `k` such that the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices is maximized. For `n = 3`, `a = 10`, and `b = 15`, the optimal choice would be `k = 2`. This means Bob should sell the first two buns at prices 15 and 14, and the last bun at the usual price 10. The total profit would be `15 + 14 + 10 = 39`.

However, the program calculates the profit as follows:
- It checks if `a >= b`. Since `10 < 15`, it enters the else block.
- It sets `k = min(b - a + 1, n) = min(15 - 10 + 1, 3) = 3`.
- It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k) = int((15 + (15 - 3 + 1)) / 2 * 3) = int(13 * 3) = 39`.
- It calculates the profit from the remaining buns: `p2 = (n - k) * a = (3 - 3) * 10 = 0`.
- The total profit is `ans + p2 = 39 + 0 = 39`.

This calculation is correct for this specific case. However, the issue arises when `b - a + 1` is less than `n`. For example, if `n = 4`, `a = 10`, and `b = 15`, the program incorrectly sets `k = 3` and calculates the profit as `39`, whereas the optimal choice would be to set `k = 2` and calculate the profit as `15 + 14 + 10 = 39`, which is the same in this case but might differ in other scenarios.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit, which involves comparing the sum of the modified prices for different values of `k` and choosing the maximum.
