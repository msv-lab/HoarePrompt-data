### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program's logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly uses `min(x, y)` to find the maximum number of draws. Let's break down why this is incorrect and how we can fix it.

1. **Sum Check:**
   - The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores is even. This ensures that the total points distributed among the players are consistent with the game's rules.

2. **Calculating Total Games:**
   - The calculation of `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2` is correct. This represents the total number of games played, where each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.

3. **Determining Maximum Draws:**
   - The original program uses `y = a + b` to represent the total points scored by the first two players combined. However, this does not directly help in determining the maximum number of draws. Instead, we need to consider the distribution of points among the players more carefully.

To determine the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- Each draw gives 1 point to each player, contributing 2 points in total.
- Each win/loss scenario gives 2 points to one player and 0 points to the other.

Given the scores \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the maximum number of draws can be calculated by:
- Subtracting the sum of the highest score and the lowest score from the total points (since the middle score must account for the remaining points).
- Dividing the result by 2 to get the maximum number of draws.

Here's the corrected logic:
1. Calculate the total points: \( \text{total\_points} = a + b + c \).
2. Calculate the points contributed by the highest and lowest scores: \( \text{remaining\_points} = \text{total\_points} - \max(a, b, c) - \min(a, b, c) \).
3. The maximum number of draws is \( \text{remaining\_points} // 2 \).

Let's apply this corrected logic to the examples:

- **Example 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Total points: `0`.
  - Remaining points: `0 - 0 - 0 = 0`.
  - Maximum draws: `0 // 2 = 0`.
  - Correct output: `0`.

- **Example 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Total points: `2`.
  - Remaining points: `2 - 1 - 0 = 1`.
  - Maximum draws: `1 // 2 = 0`.
  - Correct output: `1`.

- **Example 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Total points: `3`.
  - Remaining points: `3 - 1 - 1 = 1`.
  - Maximum draws: `1 // 2 = 0`.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Example 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Total points: `4`.
  - Remaining points: `4 - 2 - 1 = 1`.
  - Maximum draws: `1 // 2 = 0`.
  - Correct output: `2`.

- **Example 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Total points: `9`.
  - Remaining points: `9 - 3 - 3 = 3`.
  - Maximum draws: `3 // 2 = 1`.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Example 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Total points: `12`.
  - Remaining points: `12 - 5 - 3 = 4`.
  - Maximum draws: `4 // 2 = 2`.
  - Correct output: `6`.

- **Example 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Total points: `12`.
  - Remaining points: `12 - 10 - 1 = 1`.
  - Maximum draws: `1 // 2 = 0`.
  - Correct output: `2`.

With the corrected logic, the program now accurately determines the maximum number of draws for each test case.
