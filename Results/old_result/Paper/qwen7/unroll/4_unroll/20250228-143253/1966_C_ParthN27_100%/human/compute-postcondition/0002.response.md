Output State: Alice or Bob will be printed based on the input test cases. For each test case, if there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in the sorted unique list of stone piles (with an added 0 at the beginning) such that their difference is greater than 1, the game starts with Alice's turn and she wins ('Alice' is printed). Otherwise, if no such pair exists, Bob wins ('Bob' is printed). The exact output depends on the input values for each test case.
