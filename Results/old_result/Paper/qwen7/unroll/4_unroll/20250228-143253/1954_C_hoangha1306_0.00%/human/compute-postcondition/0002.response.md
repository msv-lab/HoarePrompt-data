Output State: **x and y are unchanged, t is the final value after the loop, kq1 and kq2 are strings generated from the loop based on the inputs provided during each iteration.**

Explanation: The variables `x` and `y` are not affected by the loop, so they remain unchanged. The variable `t` is used as the range for the loop, so its final value will be the number of iterations completed. During each iteration of the loop, `kq1` and `kq2` are constructed based on the comparison and conditions specified in the loop body, but their final values depend on the inputs provided during each iteration.
