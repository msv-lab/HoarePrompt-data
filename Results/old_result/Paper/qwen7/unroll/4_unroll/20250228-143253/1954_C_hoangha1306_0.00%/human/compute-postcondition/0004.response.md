Functionality: **The function processes multiple pairs of strings representing integers of the same length (digits from 1 to 9). For each pair, it generates two new strings: `kq1` and `kq2`. In `kq1`, the function pairs the smaller digit from each position of the input strings, while in `kq2`, it pairs the larger digit. If the digits at a position are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` contain the same digit. After processing all pairs, it prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each pair.**
