You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

        b = input()

        vt = 0
        for i in range(len(a)):

                kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
                kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
                continue
            else:
                (x, y) = (min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i])))
                if vt == 0:
                    vt = 1
                    if a[i] > b[i]:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                    else:
                        kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                        kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        print(kq1)
        print(kq2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple pairs of strings representing integers of the same length (digits from 1 to 9). For each pair, it generates two new strings: `kq1` and `kq2`. In `kq1`, the function pairs the smaller digit from each position of the input strings, while in `kq2`, it pairs the larger digit. If the digits at a position are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` contain the same digit. After processing all pairs, it prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each pair.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their digits. The logic in the program only checks if the digits at the same position in `x` and `y` are the same. If they are different, it swaps the smaller digit from `a[i]` and the larger digit from `b[i]`. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible product.

For example, consider the input:
```
x = 93
y = 39
```
- The program will swap the digits '9' and '3', resulting in `x = 33` and `y = 99`.
- The product of `33 * 99` is `3267`.

However, the optimal solution would be to keep `x = 93` and `y = 39`, resulting in a product of `3587`.

Thus, the program does not correctly maximize the product in all cases.
