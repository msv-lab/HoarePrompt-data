Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each containing either `1`, `math.ceil(k / 2)`, or `k // 2 + 1`, depending on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. For each test case, if `k` equals 1, the output is `1`. If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, the output is `math.ceil(k / 2)`. Otherwise, the output is `k // 2 + 1`. The number of lines in the output state corresponds to the number of test cases provided as input.
