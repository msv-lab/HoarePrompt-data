Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

Given the constraints, the function indirectly accepts `t`, `n`, and `k` as inputs and returns a value determined by the relationship between `n` and `k`.
