You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and n is the length of the string s such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6.
def func_2():
    s = input()
    n, x = len(s), -1
    if (func_1(s[0:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(s)
        #This is printed: s (where s is the input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters)
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is -1. The function `func_1(s)` returns True.
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is either the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same.
    if (x == -1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to -1
    if (func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
        #This is printed: s[:x + 1] s[x + 1:]
    else :
        if (x == 1 or x == n // 2) :

            print(2)
            #This is printed: 2
            print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
            #This is printed: s[:x + 2] s[x + 2:]
        #State: Postcondition: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to -1, and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns True. If `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s`, the function continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function continues as specified in the else part.
    #State: Postcondition: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns False, the function continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function continues as specified in the else part. Specifically, if `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s`, the function continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function continues as specified in the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns None

Case_2: The program returns None

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
