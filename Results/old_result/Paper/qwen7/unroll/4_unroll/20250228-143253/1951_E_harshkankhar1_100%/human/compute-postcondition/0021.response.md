Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. Here, `x` is not equal to -1, and it is either 1 or half the length of `s`.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`.

The print statement in question is `print('NO')`.

Given the information, the print statement directly outputs the string `'NO'`. The values of `x`, `s`, and `n` do not affect this specific print statement.

Output: **NO**
