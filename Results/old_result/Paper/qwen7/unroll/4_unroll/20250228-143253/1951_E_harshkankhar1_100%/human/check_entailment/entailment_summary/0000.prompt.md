Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and returns `True` if the string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward), otherwise it returns `False`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters and determines whether certain conditions are met based on the characters in the string. It prints 'YES' or 'NO' and some indices or substrings of `s` depending on the conditions. The function ultimately returns `None`.
