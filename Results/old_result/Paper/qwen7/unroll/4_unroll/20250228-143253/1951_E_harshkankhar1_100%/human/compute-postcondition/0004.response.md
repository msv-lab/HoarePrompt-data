Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is -1.
- The function `func_1(s)` returns `False`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1)
```

This statement directly prints the integer `1`. Since there are no variables or objects within the `print` statement itself, the only thing being printed is the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
