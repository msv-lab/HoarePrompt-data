Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the array. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Length**: The program aims to find the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number. However, the logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. Specifically, the variable `same` is only incremented when `ar[i]` equals `num`, which does not correctly track the length of consecutive segments. Additionally, the logic for updating `minn` is also incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the transitions between different numbers.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire array consists of the same number. In such cases, the current logic would incorrectly identify the length of the array as the minimum segment length.

3. **Output Logic**: The program checks if `minn` is `inf` or equal to the length of the array to determine if the array cannot be made non-beautiful. This is incorrect because the condition should be checking if the entire array is uniform, which is already guaranteed by the problem statement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))

        minn = inf
        prev_num = ar[0]
        same = 1

        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == prev_num:
                same += 1
            else:
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            prev_num = ar[i]

        minn = min(minn, same)

        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - minn)

# Example usage
func()
```

Explanation of the corrections:
- The `prev_num` and `same` variables are used to track the previous number and the length of the current segment of the same number.
- The `for` loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` appropriately.
- After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time to account for the final segment.
- The final output is calculated as `n - minn`, which gives the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Given these corrections, the original program was incorrect, and the corrected version should now work as intended.

Correctness: **False**
