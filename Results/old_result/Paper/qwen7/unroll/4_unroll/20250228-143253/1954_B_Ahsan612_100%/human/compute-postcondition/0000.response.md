Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following objects:
   - `_`: This is a variable used to iterate over the input values.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `_` is initialized by the input function `int(input())`.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are more test cases to process.
   - The number of test cases is determined by the input value, which is read as an integer.

Given this information, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will be assigned to `_` in the loop. Specifically, we need to ensure that the input value is valid (i.e., within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be an integer within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
