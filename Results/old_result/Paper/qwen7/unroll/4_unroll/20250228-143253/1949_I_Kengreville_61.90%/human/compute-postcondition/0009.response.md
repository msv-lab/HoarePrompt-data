Output State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of `n` None values, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef1` is a list of `n` None values.

Explanation: The loop reads `n` sets of integers from the input for each index `i` in the range of `n`, and assigns these integers to `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]`. It does not modify `nodes`, `coef0`, `visited`, or `coef1`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged. The `x`, `y`, and `r` lists are populated with integers based on user input.
