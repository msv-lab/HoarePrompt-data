The function starts a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from the disk indexed by `i`. During the traversal, it marks all disks that are directly touchable (i.e., their distance equals the sum of their radii) from the current disk as visited and records the order of visited disks in the `nodes` list. The function does not return any value.
