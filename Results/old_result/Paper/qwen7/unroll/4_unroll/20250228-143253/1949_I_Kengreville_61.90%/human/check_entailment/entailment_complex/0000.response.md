Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input and initializes necessary variables.
   - It iterates over each disk and performs a DFS if the disk has not been visited yet.
   - During the DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent by comparing the squared distance between their centers with the sum of their radii.
   - It updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values based on the tangency condition.
   - After the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the nodes visited is non-zero. If so, it prints "YES" indicating it's possible to decrease the total radius while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.
   - If the sum of `coef1` is zero, it prints "NO".

2. **Function `dfs` Analysis**:
   - The DFS function marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - It then checks all other disks to see if they are tangent to the current disk.
   - If a tangent disk is found, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values and recursively calls itself for the tangent disk.
   - This ensures that all disks that are part of the same connected component (where tangency forms a graph) are processed.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if it's possible to decrease the total radius while maintaining the tangency conditions and avoiding overlap.
   - The DFS function correctly identifies the connected components of tangent disks and updates the coefficients accordingly.
   - The program handles all edge cases as per the problem statement, including the possibility of no disks being tangent and the requirement for the sum of radii to strictly decrease.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
