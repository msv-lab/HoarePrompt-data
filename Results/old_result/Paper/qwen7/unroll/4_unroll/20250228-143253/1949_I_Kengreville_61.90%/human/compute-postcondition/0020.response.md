Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (an integer between 1 and 1000), x (a list of n integers representing x-coordinates), y (a list of n integers representing y-coordinates), and r (a list of n integers representing radii). It returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and two lists `x` and `y`, each containing `n` integers representing coordinates, along with another list `r` containing `n` integers representing radii. The function does not directly return a specific value from the problem statement but rather implies it processes these inputs according to some unspecified logic related to the disks' positions and radii.
