You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of

        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function starts a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from the disk indexed by `i`. During the traversal, it marks all disks that are directly touchable (i.e., their distance equals the sum of their radii) from the current disk as visited and records the order of visited disks in the `nodes` list. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients.
   - `nodes` is used to store nodes during DFS traversal.
   
3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each disk to perform a DFS starting from unvisited disks.
   - During DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent (`(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`).
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure that the tangency condition remains true even after decreasing the radii.
   - It then recursively calls DFS on the neighboring disk.
   - After completing the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is non-zero. If so, it means we can reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

4. **Output:**
   - If any DFS results in a non-zero `coef1` sum, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Tangency Condition:**
   - The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the distance formula between their centers and their radii.
   
2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are processed.
   
3. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.
   
4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced by checking the non-zero `coef1` sum.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles the case where disks are tangent and the tangency condition must be preserved.
- It correctly identifies when it is possible to reduce the radii without violating the tangency conditions.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.
