`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively, and `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`. `nodes` is a list used to store the order of visited nodes during the DFS traversal, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to `0`.
