The function processes a set of disk centers represented by their x and y coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on these disks and calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each disk. Based on the sum of `coef1` values obtained from the DFS, it determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state includes an empty `nodes` list, `coef0` filled with zeros, `coef1` filled with ones, `visited` marked as `True` for all disks, and `ok` set to `True` if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, otherwise `False`.
