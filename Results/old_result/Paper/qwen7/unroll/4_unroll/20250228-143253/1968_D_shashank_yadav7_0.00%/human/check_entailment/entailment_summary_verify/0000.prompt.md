You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads values for n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. It then calculates scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on specific rules involving the elements of p and a. Finally, it prints the result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') for each test case based on the comparison of the calculated scores.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the logic for updating scores and positions is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

According to the problem description, the game consists of `k` turns, and on each turn, the players can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. The program incorrectly updates the scores and positions without properly considering all possible moves.

Let's walk through the example step-by-step:

- Initial positions: Bodya at position 3 (`p[2]`), Sasha at position 2 (`p[1]`).
- Initial scores: Bodya has `a[3] = 5`, Sasha has `a[2] = 2`.

**First Turn:**
- Bodya's position: 3, score: 5.
- Sasha's position: 2, score: 2.
- Bodya can either stay at 3 or move to 1 (since `p[3] = 1`).
- Sasha can either stay at 2 or move to 3 (since `p[2] = 3`).

If Bodya moves to 1 and Sasha stays at 2:
- Bodya's new position: 1, score: 5 + a[1] = 5 + 7 = 12.
- Sasha's new position: 2, score: 2 + a[2] = 2 + 2 = 4.

If Bodya stays at 3 and Sasha moves to 3:
- Bodya's new position: 3, score: 5 + a[3] = 5 + 5 = 10.
- Sasha's new position: 3, score: 2 + a[3] = 2 + 5 = 7.

In the given program, the logic for updating scores and positions is not fully capturing these possibilities. The program incorrectly assumes that both players will always move to the position specified by the permutation, which does not account for the optimal strategy where players might choose to stay at their current position to maximize their score.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game rules for all possible scenarios, making it incorrect.
