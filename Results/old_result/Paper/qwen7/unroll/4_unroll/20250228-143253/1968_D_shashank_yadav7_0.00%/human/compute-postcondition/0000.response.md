Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each testcase, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; p is a permutation of length n; a is an array of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) remain in their initial state as described in the precondition.
