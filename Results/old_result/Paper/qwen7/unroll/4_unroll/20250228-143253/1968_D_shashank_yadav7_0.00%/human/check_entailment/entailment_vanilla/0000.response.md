Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to zero-based indices.
   - This is necessary because Python uses zero-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are also initialized to these values multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - A loop runs up to `n` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their respective `p` values.
   - The scores are updated based on the current positions and the remaining turns.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated using the `max` function to ensure they reflect the best possible outcomes.

5. **Final Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the final scores are compared.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it's a draw.

### Detailed Check:

- **Initialization:**
  - The initial scores are correctly set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]`.
  - The maximum possible scores are correctly initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
  - The scores are updated correctly based on the current positions and the remaining turns.
  - The maximum possible scores are updated using the `max` function, which ensures that the best possible outcomes are considered.

- **Final Comparison:**
  - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is correct and outputs the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
