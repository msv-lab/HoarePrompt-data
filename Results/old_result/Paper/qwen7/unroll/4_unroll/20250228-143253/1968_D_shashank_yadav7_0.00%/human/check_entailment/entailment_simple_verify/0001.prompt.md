You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the results of `t` test cases. For each test case, it prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison between `bm` (Bodya's score) and `sm` (Sasha's score) after the loop executes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to zero-based indices.
   - This is necessary because Python uses zero-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are also initialized to these values multiplied by `k`.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - A loop runs up to `n` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their respective `p` values.
   - The scores are updated based on the current positions and the remaining turns.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated using the `max` function to ensure they reflect the best possible outcomes.

5. **Final Comparison and Output:**
   - After the loop, the final scores are compared.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it's a draw.

### Detailed Check:

- **Initialization:**
  - The initial scores are correctly set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]`.
  - The maximum possible scores are correctly initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k`.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop correctly updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha using the permutation `p`.
  - The scores are updated correctly based on the current positions and the remaining turns.
  - The maximum possible scores are updated using the `max` function, which ensures that the best possible outcomes are considered.

- **Final Comparison:**
  - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is correct and outputs the appropriate result.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
