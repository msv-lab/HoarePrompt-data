Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `ans` is equal to `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`, `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.

This output state describes the final value of `ans` after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop iterates from 2 to `root` (inclusive), where `root` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. During each iteration, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i` and adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` is updated to include the sum of these values for all iterations.
