Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two positive integers `n` and `m`. For each test case, the function checks if `n` and `m` meet the conditions (both are positive integers within the specified range and their sums do not exceed the limit). If the conditions are met, the function performs some unspecified operations (not detailed here) and returns the result of these operations. If the conditions are not met, the function handles the error appropriately.**
