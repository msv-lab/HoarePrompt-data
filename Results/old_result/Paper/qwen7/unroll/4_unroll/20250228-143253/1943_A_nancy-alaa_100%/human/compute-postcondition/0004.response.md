Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it finds and prints either the smallest missing index in the array or the smallest index that appears exactly once in the array after its first occurrence. If no such index exists, it prints -1.**
