Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, for each test case, the output is either the smallest missing integer in the array or the smallest integer that appears exactly once in the array after the first unique integer. If there is no such integer, it prints nothing for that test case.
