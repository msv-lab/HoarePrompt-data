Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n. The array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for all i, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The given code is a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would modify the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
