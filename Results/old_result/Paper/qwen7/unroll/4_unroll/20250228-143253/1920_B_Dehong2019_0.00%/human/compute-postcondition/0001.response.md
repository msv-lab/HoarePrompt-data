Output State: **`t` is reduced to an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` now holds the value of the input integer provided by the user. All other conditions and constraints on `n`, `k`, `x`, and the array `a` remain unchanged.
