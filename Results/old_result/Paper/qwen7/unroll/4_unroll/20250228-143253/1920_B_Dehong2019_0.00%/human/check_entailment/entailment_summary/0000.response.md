Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
3. It sorts the array `a` in non-increasing order.
4. It calculates `ans1` by initially summing the entire array and then subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements (since Bob can negate up to `x` elements).
5. It calculates `ans2` by initially summing the entire array and then adding the sum of the first `k` elements (since Alice can remove up to `k` elements).
6. For each test case, it iterates through the first `k` elements, adjusting `ans1` by adding the current element and subtracting twice the element at position `i + x` if `i + x` is within bounds. This simulates Bob's optimal negation strategy after Alice has removed elements.
7. It determines the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` and prints it.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the problem statement, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution.

Correctness: **True**
