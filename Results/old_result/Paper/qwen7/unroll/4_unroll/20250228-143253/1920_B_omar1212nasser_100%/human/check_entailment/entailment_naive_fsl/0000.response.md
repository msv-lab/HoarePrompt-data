Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1 in an optimal manner. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not consider the optimal strategy for both players. Here's a counterexample to demonstrate this:

Consider the following input:
```
3 1 1
-1 1 -1
```

According to the problem description:
- Alice can remove at most 1 element.
- Bob can multiply at most 1 element by -1.

The optimal strategy would be:
- Alice removes the element `-1`.
- Bob multiplies the remaining `-1` by -1, resulting in `1`.

Thus, the final sum should be `1`, but the current implementation does not achieve this. The function `func_2` does not correctly account for the optimal moves of both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
