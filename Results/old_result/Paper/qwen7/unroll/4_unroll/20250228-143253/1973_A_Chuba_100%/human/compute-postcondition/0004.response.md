Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the conditions defined for the variables t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. For each test case, if t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 500 and p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, the function evaluates these values and returns a corresponding output.**

Note: The actual return value based on the conditions for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3 is not specified in the given information.
