Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either '-1' or a non-negative integer result. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`. Each line's content depends on the input provided during each iteration of the loop. If the sum of the three integers in a line is odd, it will print '-1'. Otherwise, it will print the calculated result based on the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
