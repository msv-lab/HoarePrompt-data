Functionality: **The function reads a positive integer `t` and then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` and checks if their sum is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result using the formula `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - max(0, p_3 - p_1 - p_2)) // 2` and prints this result. After processing all test cases, the function ends, printing a series of `-1` or calculated results based on the input provided.**
