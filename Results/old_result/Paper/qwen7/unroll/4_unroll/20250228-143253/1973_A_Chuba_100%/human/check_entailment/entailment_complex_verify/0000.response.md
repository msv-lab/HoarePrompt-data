### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and compare it with the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- The scores \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \) must satisfy \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \).
- The sum of the scores \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 \) must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (two draws).

#### Given Program:
```python
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- For each test case, it reads three integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3 \).
- It checks if the sum of these integers is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`.
- If the sum is even, it calculates the result using the formula \( \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2} \) and prints the result.

#### Analysis of the Formula:
The formula \( \frac{v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])}{2} \) is intended to calculate the maximum number of draws. However, let's break down why this formula might be incorrect.

1. **Sum of Scores**: The sum \( v[0] + v[1] + v[2] \) must be even. This part is correct.
2. **Max Draws Calculation**: The term \( \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]) \) is supposed to adjust for the fact that the difference \( v[2] - v[0] - v[1] \) represents the excess points that need to be accounted for as draws. However, this term does not correctly reflect the maximum number of draws.

#### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of draws, we should consider the following:
- Let \( d \) be the number of draws.
- Let \( w \) be the number of wins (and losses, since each win corresponds to a loss).
- The total points can be expressed as \( 2w + d \).
- We need to maximize \( d \) while ensuring \( 2w + d = v[0] + v[1] + v[2] \).

Given \( p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \), the maximum number of draws \( d \) can be found by:
\[ d = \min(v_2 - v_1, v_3 - v_2, \frac{v_0 + v_1 + v_2}{2} - \max(v_2 - v_1, 0)) \]

However, the given program uses a simpler but incorrect approach.

#### Example Analysis:
1. **Input: `1 1 2`**
   - Correct Solution: Maximum draws = 1 (as described in the problem statement).
   - Program Output: 2 (incorrect).

2. **Input: `3 4 5`**
   - Correct Solution: Maximum draws = 3 (as described in the problem statement).
   - Program Output: 6 (incorrect).

The program's formula does not correctly reflect the maximum number of draws, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws and is therefore incorrect.

**Final: False**
