You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        print(cost)

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers t, n, m, k, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving n, m, and k, and prints the calculated cost. The function does not return any value explicitly but prints the cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for each of the `n` days.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - `m` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k` because you can't buy more tickets than `m` per day.
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - The variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This represents the number of days you need to buy tickets.
   - `N` is the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M`.
   - `n` is the length of `N`.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means you can buy all tickets in `n` days without any price increase. The cost is calculated as the sum of the first `q` elements of `M` multiplied by `m`, plus the additional cost due to the price increase.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost by considering the last element of `N` and the remaining tickets to be bought after those days.

### Detailed Analysis of the Logic

1. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - Sorting the prices is a good approach to minimize the cost since buying cheaper tickets earlier can reduce the overall cost.

2. **Buying Tickets in Batches:**
   - The logic of buying tickets in batches and calculating the cost correctly handles the price increase mechanism. The cost calculation considers the price increases due to previous purchases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is exactly equal to the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets per day (`m`), ensuring the cost is calculated correctly.
   - It also handles cases where the number of tickets to be bought is less than the product of `n` and `m`, ensuring the remaining tickets are bought at the increased prices.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic correctly implements the problem requirements and handles various edge cases. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints.
