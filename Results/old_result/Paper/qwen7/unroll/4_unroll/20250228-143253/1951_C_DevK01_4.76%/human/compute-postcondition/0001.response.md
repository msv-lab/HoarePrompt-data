Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only object here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the problem, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop `for _ in range(t)` to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). Since `t` is given as an input, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: The initial state of `t` is given as an integer between 1 and \(10^4\). We need to ensure that this condition holds true for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive**
