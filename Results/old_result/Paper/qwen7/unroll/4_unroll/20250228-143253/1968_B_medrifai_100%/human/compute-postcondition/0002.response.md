Output State: **The program returns the value of j plus the index of the first occurrence of a[i] in the substring b[j:].**

This means that the program will add the current index `j` (where the substring of `b` starts) to the index of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` within that substring. The result is a new index that points to the position of `a[i]` relative to the start of `b`.
