#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i and j are non-negative integers representing the current indices being compared in strings a and b respectively, such that 0 <= i <= len(a) and 0 <= j <= len(b).
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the value of j plus the index of the first occurrence of a[i] in the substring b[j:].
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. If found, it returns the index of this occurrence relative to `b[j]` added to `j`. If not found, it returns `-1`.
