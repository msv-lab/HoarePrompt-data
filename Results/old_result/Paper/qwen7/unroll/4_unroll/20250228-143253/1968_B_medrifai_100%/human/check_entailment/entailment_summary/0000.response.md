Reasoning:

The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum prefix length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`.

1. The program iterates through both strings `a` and `b` using two pointers (`i` for `a` and `j` for `b`).
2. For each character in `a`, it uses the helper function `func_1` to find the next occurrence of that character in the remaining part of `b`.
3. If the character is found, it increments the pointer `j` to the position after the found character and continues checking the next character in `a`.
4. The counter `c` keeps track of the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

The helper function `func_1` is correctly implemented to search for the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` and return the appropriate index. If the character is not found, it returns `-1`, which correctly breaks the loop and stops further checks.

Given the structure and the implementation of both the main loop and the helper function, the program should work as expected according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
