Output State: **`a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, indicating the initial position of your cow, and `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`.**

The code assigns the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a` to the variable `x`. All other elements in the list `a` and the value of `k` remain unchanged.
