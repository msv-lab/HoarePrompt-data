Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is the loop variable that starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range function, which determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `ind` is an empty list.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), indicating the initial position of your cow.
   - `x` is the integer at index `k` in list `a`.
   - `c` is 0.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop runs based on the value of `n`, `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and will increment until it reaches `n-1`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state should be:
**`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
