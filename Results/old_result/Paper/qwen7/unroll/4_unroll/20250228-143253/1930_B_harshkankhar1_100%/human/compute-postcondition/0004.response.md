Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3) and an integer \( n \) (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it creates a list of integers from 1 to \( n \), reverses every second element in the list, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the list for each test case.**
