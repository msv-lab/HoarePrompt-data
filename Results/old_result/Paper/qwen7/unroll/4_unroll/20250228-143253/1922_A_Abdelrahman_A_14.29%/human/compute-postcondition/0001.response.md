State: **`tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `tests`.
2. For the loop to execute, `tests` must be a valid integer within the specified range (1 to 1000, inclusive).
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, as per the `range(tests)` syntax.
4. Therefore, the state of `tests` must be adjusted to ensure it is within the valid range, and `i` should be set to 0.

Thus, the required state adjustment is that `tests` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `i` must be 0.
