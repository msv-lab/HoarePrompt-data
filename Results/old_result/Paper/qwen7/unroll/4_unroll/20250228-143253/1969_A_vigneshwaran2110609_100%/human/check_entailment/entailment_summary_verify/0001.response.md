### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.
   - The program should output the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`t`), but it does not handle each test case properly.
   - The code attempts to check if a pair of friends `(i, l[i]-1)` are each other’s best friends and prints `2` if true.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not ensure that at least 2 friends will come to the party.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each test case, we need to identify pairs of friends who are each other’s best friends.
   - If there is at least one such pair, we only need to invite those two friends, which requires 2 invitations.
   - If no such pair exists, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

4. **Corrected Code:**
   - We need to iterate through the list of friends and check for pairs where `l[l[i]-1] == i+1`.
   - If such a pair is found, we add both friends to a set to avoid counting duplicates.
   - If the set size is at least 2, we print the size of the set (which represents the minimum number of invitations).
   - Otherwise, we print `3`.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary describes the logic correctly: it checks for pairs where `l[l[i]-1] == i+1` and prints `2` if such a pair is found, otherwise it prints `3`.
   - However, the implementation in the given code does not follow this logic correctly.

6. **Evaluation:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the given code is incorrect because it does not ensure that at least 2 friends will come to the party.
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment is also correct and follows the right logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately identified the flaw in the given code and proposed a correct solution. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
