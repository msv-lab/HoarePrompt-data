Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program incorrectly handles the input. It reads `n` which is the number of friends, but then it should read the list of best friends `p` for each test case. However, the program reads `x` (which is not defined in the problem statement) and then reads the list `l` of best friends. This is incorrect because `x` is not part of the problem input.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1` for any `i` in the range 0 to `x-1`. This condition is checking if the best friend of the best friend of a friend is the friend itself, which is not relevant to the problem. The problem requires that both a friend and their best friend receive an invitation to attend the party.

3. **Output Logic**: If the condition `p[p[i] - 1] == i + 1` is met for any `i`, the program prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`. This logic is incorrect because:
   - If there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, only 2 invitations need to be sent.
   - If no such pair exists, we need to consider the worst-case scenario where we might need to invite more than just pairs to ensure at least 2 friends attend.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, in the third test case where `n=2` and `p=[2, 1]`, the program should print `2` because inviting both friends ensures that both attend. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
