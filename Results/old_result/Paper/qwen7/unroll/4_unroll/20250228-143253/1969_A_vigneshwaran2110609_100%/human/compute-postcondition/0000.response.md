Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while `t` remains unchanged and still satisfies the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`. The list `p` is not modified by this code.
