You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop prints either 2 or 3 for each iteration based on the condition inside the loop. Since the loop does not modify any of the variables outside its scope (t, n, and p), their states remain unchanged. The output consists of a series of 2's or 3's printed during the loop executions, depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` was met for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list p of n distinct integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i). For each test case, it reads the list p and checks if p[p[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in the range 0 to x-1, where x is another integer input. If the condition is met for any i, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but outputs a series of 2's or 3's based on the condition check for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.
   - The program should output the minimum number of invitations needed for each test case.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`n`), but it does not handle each test case properly.
   - The code attempts to check if a pair of friends `(i, l[i]-1)` are each other’s best friends and prints `2` if true.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not ensure that at least 2 friends will come to the party.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each test case, we need to identify pairs of friends who are each other’s best friends.
   - If there is at least one such pair, we only need to invite those two friends, which requires 2 invitations.
   - If no such pair exists, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come to the party.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to iterate through the list of friends and check for pairs where `l[l[i]-1] == i+1`.
   - If such a pair is found, we print `2`.
   - Otherwise, we print `3`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        invited = set()
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                invited.add(i + 1)
                invited.add(l[i])
        if len(invited) >= 2:
            print(len(invited))
        else:
            print(3)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
