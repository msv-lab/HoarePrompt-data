Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This expression calculates \(2^{31} - 1\), which equals 2147483647. The variable `times` remains unchanged from its initial state as it was not modified by the given code snippet.
