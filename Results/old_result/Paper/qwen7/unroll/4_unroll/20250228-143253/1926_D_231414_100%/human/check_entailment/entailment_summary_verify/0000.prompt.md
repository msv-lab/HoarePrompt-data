You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dic = dict()
        ans = 0
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if i in dic:
                dic[i] -= 1
                if dic[i] == 0:
                    del dic[i]
            else:
                if s not in dic:
                    dic[s] = 0
                dic[s] += 1
                ans += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of subsequent test cases, then for each of these test cases, it reads another positive integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the count of elements in the list that do not have their bitwise XOR with `2^31 - 1` present in a dictionary. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses bitwise XOR (`^`) with `check` (which is `2**31 - 1`, or `111...111` in binary, with 31 ones) to flip all bits of the input numbers. However, this approach does not ensure that any two numbers in the same group will differ in all 31 bits. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2
1 2
2
3 4
2
5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
2
2
2
```

However, the program's output for this case would be:
```
2
2
2
```

But let's analyze the actual behavior:
- For the first test case, `1` and `2` have different last 31 bits, so they should be in different groups.
- For the second test case, `3` and `4` also have different last 31 bits, so they should be in different groups.
- For the third test case, `5` and `6` have different last 31 bits, so they should be in different groups.

The program incorrectly counts these pairs as needing only one group because it uses the XOR operation, which does not guarantee that all bits are different. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement that any two numbers in the same group must differ in all 31 bits.

A correct solution would involve checking all 31 bits individually and ensuring that no two numbers share the same bit pattern across all 31 bits.
