t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. Similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. a and b are binary strings of lengths n and m respectively.
