Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints involving an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), where each test case contains n constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x), with a being an integer in {1, 2, 3} and x being an integer (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9). The function ensures there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
