Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to represent the upper and lower bounds of the range of valid `k` values, respectively. It also initializes a set `cx` to store the values that `k` cannot be (from type 3 constraints).
3. It iterates through each constraint, updating `ax`, `bx`, and `cx` accordingly:
   - For type 1 constraints (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
   - For type 2 constraints (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
   - For type 3 constraints (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
4. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there is no valid `k` and appends `0` to the result list `r`.
5. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of invalid `k` values (those in `cx` and within the range `[bx, ax]`) and subtracts this from the total number of valid `k` values (`ax - bx + 1`). This calculation ensures that only the valid `k` values outside the set `cx` are counted.
6. Finally, it prints the list of results, each on a new line.

Given the logic and the constraints mentioned in the problem statement, the function appears to handle all cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
