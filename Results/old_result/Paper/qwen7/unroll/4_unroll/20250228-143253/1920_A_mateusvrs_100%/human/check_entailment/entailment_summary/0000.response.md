Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes variables to track the maximum value (`bx`) for type 1 constraints and the minimum value (`ax`) for type 2 constraints.
2. It uses a set `cx` to store values for type 3 constraints.
3. For each constraint, it updates `bx`, `ax`, or adds the constraint value to `cx` based on the constraint type.
4. After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list because no integer can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.
5. If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that do not match any value in `cx`.
6. The final result is calculated as the length of the range minus the count of overlapping values from type 3 constraints.
7. The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over them and storing the results in a list before printing.

Given the execution summary and the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem accurately.

Correctness: **True**
