### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes variables `ax` and `bx` to store the upper and lower bounds of the range of valid `k` values, respectively.
   - It also uses a set `cx` to store the values that `k` cannot be (`k != x`).
   - The program correctly updates `ax` and `bx` based on the constraints:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), the value `x` is added to the set `cx`.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of invalid `k` values (stored in `tmp`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, with each result on a new line.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
