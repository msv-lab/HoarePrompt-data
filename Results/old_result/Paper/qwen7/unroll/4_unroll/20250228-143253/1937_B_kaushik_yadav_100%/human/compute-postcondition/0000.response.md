Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n} and a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n} are provided, where each a_{ij} is either 0 or 1; input function is updated to read from standard input.**

Explanation: The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` updates the `input` function to read from standard input (stdin) instead of the default behavior. However, it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the binary strings. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only change is in the way the `input` function is used.
