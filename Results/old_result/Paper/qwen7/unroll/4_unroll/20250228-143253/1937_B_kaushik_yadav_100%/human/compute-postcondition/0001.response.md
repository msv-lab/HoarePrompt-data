Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `t` is updated to the value of `int(input())`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `t` is now updated to the value entered by the user.
