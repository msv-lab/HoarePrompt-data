Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5), and two binary strings `a_1` and `a_2` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the comparison of these two binary strings for each test case.**

Note: The actual logic for processing the binary strings and determining the return value is not described here, only the parameters and their constraints are outlined.
