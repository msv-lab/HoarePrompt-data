Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple groups of `k` cards with the same number exist, and the frequency of each group is less than `k`. For example, consider the input:

```
3
5 3
2 2 3 3 3
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
6 3
10 20 30 10 20 40
```

For the first test case, the program will output `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. This is because we can exchange the three `3`s for two new cards, leaving us with two cards: one `2` and one `3`.

The issue lies in the way the frequency table is handled. The function `func_1` limits the frequency of any number to `k`, but it does not ensure that we are minimizing the number of cards. Instead, we need to count how many full groups of `k` cards we can form and then calculate the remaining cards accordingly.

A corrected approach would involve counting the number of full groups of `k` cards and then calculating the remainder. Here's a revised version of the solution:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    from collections import Counter
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    result = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        result += (count // k) * (k - 1) + (count % k)
    
    print(result)
```

This revised solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cards by forming as many full groups of `k` cards as possible and then adding the remaining cards.
