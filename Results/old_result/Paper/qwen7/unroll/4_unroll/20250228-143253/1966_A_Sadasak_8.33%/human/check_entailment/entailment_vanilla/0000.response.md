Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if you cannot select `k` cards, you cannot perform any exchanges.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because you can exchange all `n` cards for `n - 1` new cards.

3. **Handling General Case:**
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - It checks if `k` is present in the values of the frequency table.
     - If `k` is present, it prints `k - 1`. This is incorrect because even if `k` is present in the frequency values, it doesn't necessarily mean you can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1`.
     - If `k` is not present, it prints `n`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of reducing the number of cards further.

### Detailed Explanation

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function creates a frequency table of the card numbers.
  - It ensures that no number appears more than `k` times by setting the count to `k` if it exceeds `k`.

- **Main Logic:**
  - The logic to determine the minimum number of cards is flawed.
  - The condition `if k in freq.values()` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards.
  - The program should consider the distribution of card counts and the ability to exchange groups of `k` cards.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Group the card numbers by their counts.
2. Determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Corrected Program

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = sum(v // k for v in freq.values()) * (k - 1) + sum(v % k for v in freq.values())
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Count the Frequency:**
   - Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each card number.

2. **Calculate Minimum Cards:**
   - For each group of card numbers, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed (`v // k`).
   - Multiply by `(k - 1)` to get the number of cards after exchanging.
   - Add the remaining cards that cannot form a full group (`v % k`).

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect. The corrected program provided above should be used instead.

Correctness: **False**
