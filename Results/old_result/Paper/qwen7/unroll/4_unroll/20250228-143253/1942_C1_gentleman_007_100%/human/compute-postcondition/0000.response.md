Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where every element is initially set to True.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `prime` with a length of `num + 1`, where every element in the list is set to `True`. This means that before the code is executed, `num` is a non-negative integer, and after the code is executed, `prime` is a list of boolean values, each initialized to `True`, and its length is `num + 1`.
