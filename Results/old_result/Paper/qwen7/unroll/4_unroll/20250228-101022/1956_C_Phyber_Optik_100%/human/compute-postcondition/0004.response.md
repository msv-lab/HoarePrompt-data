Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. For each test case, the function determines and returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`, and it processes these test cases according to the given constraints. It does not directly accept `t` and `n` as parameters within the function definition but rather seems to receive them through an external mechanism or loop over the test cases.
