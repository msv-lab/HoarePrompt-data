You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. For each iteration of the loop, the following operations are performed:
    #
    #1. A new value of `n` is taken as input.
    #2. A variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
    #3. A nested loop calculates `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`.
    #4. The result of `sum` and `n + n` are printed.
    #5. Another nested loop prints two lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, with the first line containing `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line containing `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `t` and `n` will be the last values provided as input within the loop. The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to an iteration of the loop, showing the calculated `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two lines of printed ranges for each value of `j`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. There are two types of operations:
   - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
   - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - The program calculates `sum` as \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \). This simplifies to \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \).
   - The program prints `sum` and `2n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It then performs `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The calculation of `sum` seems incorrect. The formula provided does not match the problem's requirements.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum sum is simply \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \), which is not true.
   - The program correctly prints `2n` as the number of operations, but the operations themselves do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to set each row and each column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - We can achieve this by performing `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and the operations to achieve it.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
