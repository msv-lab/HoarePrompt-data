Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The program attempts to calculate a sum using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. However, this formula does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through the allowed operations. The goal is to fill the matrix with permutations of numbers from 1 to `n` in such a way that the sum of all elements is maximized, not to compute some mathematical expression.

2. **Operations Description**: The program prints operations of type 1 and type 2, but these operations are not correctly defined according to the problem statement. Specifically, the operations should assign a permutation of numbers from 1 to `n` to either the entire `i`-th row or the entire `j`-th column, but the program simply prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n` without ensuring they form a valid permutation or follow the problem's constraints.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program prints a sum (`sum`) and `n + n` but does not ensure that the sum is actually the maximum possible sum for the given matrix. Moreover, the operations printed do not reflect the actual permutations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
