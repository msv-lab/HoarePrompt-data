### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calculates `sum` as \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \).
   - This simplifies to \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \).
   - The expression further simplifies to \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i) \).
   - This results in \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} 2i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \).
   - Which simplifies to \( 1 + 2 \sum_{i=2}^{n} i^2 - \sum_{i=2}^{n} i \).
   - This is not directly related to maximizing the sum of the matrix elements.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum, we need to set each element \( a_{i,j} \) to its maximum possible value within the constraints.
   - The maximum value for any element in the matrix is \( n \).
   - We can achieve this by performing \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, setting each row and column to the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Review of the Given Code:**
   - The code incorrectly calculates a sum and prints it without actually performing the required operations.
   - It prints `n + n` operations, which is correct in terms of the upper limit, but the operations themselves are not correct.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly solve the problem. It calculates an incorrect sum and does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the matrix sum.

**Correctness: False**
