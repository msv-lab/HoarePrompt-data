Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, where `t` is now the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 remains valid, and now `t` is specifically set to the integer input value. The variable `n` is not yet defined and still follows its precondition of being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, but its specific value is not known at this point.
