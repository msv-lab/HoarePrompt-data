The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`. It then prints the calculated sum and `n + n`. Additionally, it prints two lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, with the first line containing `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line containing `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs multiple lines of results corresponding to each test case.
