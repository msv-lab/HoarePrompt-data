Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Expression Analysis:**
   - Since `n` is 0, let's evaluate the expression for `h`:
     - `n // (n - k + 1)` becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `0 // (-k + 1)`.
     - If `k` is any positive integer, `-k + 1` will be a negative number, and dividing 0 by a non-zero negative number results in 0.
     - Therefore, `0 // (-k + 1) = 0`.
     - `n // 1` is simply `0 // 1`, which equals 0.
     - So, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `h >= k` must hold true. Given that `h` is 0, this implies that `k` must be 0 or less. However, since `k` is typically a positive integer in such contexts, this condition might not hold unless `k` is explicitly set to 0.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(2)`.
   - This will directly print the integer 2.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will execute and print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
