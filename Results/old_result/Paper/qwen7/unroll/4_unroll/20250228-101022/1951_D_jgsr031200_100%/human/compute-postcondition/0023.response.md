Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and 1, then returns `k` (or `n`). If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' and returns `None`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, it calculates the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, stores these values in `h` and `n`, respectively, and prints 'YES', 2, and the values of `costs`. Finally, it returns `None` if `h` is less than `k`, otherwise, it returns `None`.**
