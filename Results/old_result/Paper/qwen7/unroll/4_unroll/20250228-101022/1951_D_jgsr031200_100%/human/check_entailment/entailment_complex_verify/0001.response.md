### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires setting up stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she cannot afford any more jewels in the next stall.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined to handle the logic for determining if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels.
   
3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and each jewel costs 1 coin, she can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is also correct because if Alice has fewer coins than needed to buy even one jewel, it's impossible.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost array `costs` and checks if the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls is at least `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls and the cost array. If not, it prints "NO".

4. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The program attempts to use only 2 stalls, which might not always be sufficient. However, the problem statement allows for up to 60 stalls, but the solution only uses 2 stalls.
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels with 2 stalls is correct, but it doesn't explore other potential solutions involving more stalls.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the basic cases correctly but does not cover all edge cases, especially when more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is close to `n`, the program might fail to find a solution with just 2 stalls.
   - The program does not consider scenarios where more than 2 stalls are necessary to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow of the program.
   - The program logic is sound for the specific cases it handles, but it fails to explore all possible configurations of stalls and prices.

### Conclusion:

While the program correctly handles some basic cases, it does not explore all possible configurations of stalls and prices, which could lead to incorrect results for certain inputs. Specifically, the program only considers using 2 stalls, which may not always be sufficient to achieve the exact number of jewels `k`.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
