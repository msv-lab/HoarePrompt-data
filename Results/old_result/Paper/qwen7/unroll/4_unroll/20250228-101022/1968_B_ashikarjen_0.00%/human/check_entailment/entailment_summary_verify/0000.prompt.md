You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

    0

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)



- Function Summary: 
For each test case, the function reads integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then counts the number of positions in string \( b \) where the characters match those in string \( a \) up to the current position in \( a \), without exceeding the length of \( b \). Finally, it prints the total count of such matching positions across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program iterates through each character of the string `a` and checks if it can be found in the string `b` as a subsequence. The logic seems to correctly implement the requirement to find the maximum prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:
- It initializes `k` to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- It uses a nested loop to compare each character of `a` with the characters of `b`.
- For each character in `a`, it advances in `b` until it finds a match or reaches the end of `b`.
- If a match is found, it increments `k` and continues to the next character in `a`.

This approach ensures that the program works correctly for all given examples and potential cases within the constraints. There doesn't seem to be any edge case that this program would fail to handle based on the problem description and provided examples.
