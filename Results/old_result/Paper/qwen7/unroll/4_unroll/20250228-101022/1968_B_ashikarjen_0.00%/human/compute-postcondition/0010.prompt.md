You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and two binary strings a and b are provided where the length of a is n and the length of b is m. The sum of all n values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; `b` is a string obtained from the input; `k` is an integer representing the number of times the condition `b[j] == a[i]` was true for all `i` in `range(n)` and before `j` reached `m`; `j` is an integer representing the position in string `b` after the loop has executed.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of occurrences where b[j] == a[i] for all i in range(n) and before j reached m)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts integers t, n, and m, and two binary strings a and b. It returns a result based on the comparison or manipulation of these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
