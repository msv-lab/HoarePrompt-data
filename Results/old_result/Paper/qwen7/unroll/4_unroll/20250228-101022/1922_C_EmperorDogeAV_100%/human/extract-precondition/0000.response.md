Precondition: **cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1]), and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Additionally, the function takes another parameter m, which is the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. Each x_i and y_i is an index into the cities list, satisfying 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.**
