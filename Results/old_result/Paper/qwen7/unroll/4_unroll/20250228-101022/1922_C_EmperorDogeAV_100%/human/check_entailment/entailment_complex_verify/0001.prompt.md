You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1]), and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Additionally, the function takes another parameter m, which is the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. Each x_i and y_i is an index into the cities list, satisfying 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.

    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and checks whether moving forward to the next city or backward to the previous city is closer. If moving forward is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city. Since the cities are in ascending order, moving forward will always be closer, so `prog_cities[i]` will be set to 1 for all valid indices i. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero as they do not have both a preceding and succeeding city to compare with.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of city coordinates in ascending order and returns a list of \(n-1\) ones, where \(n\) is the number of cities. The first and last elements of the returned list are zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost depends on the closest city concept. The closest city to a given city `i` is the city `j` such that the distance between `i` and `j` is minimized compared to distances to all other cities.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the closest city for each city using the function `func_1`.
   - It then calculates prefix sums for both forward and backward directions.
   - Finally, it processes each query using these prefix sums to find the minimum cost.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to determine the closest city for each city.
   - It initializes an array `prog_cities` to store the closest city information.
   - It iterates through each city and determines the closest city by comparing distances to the next and previous cities.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` seems flawed. It should determine the closest city based on the unique closest city condition, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.

4. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are calculated based on the closest city information.
   - These sums are used to quickly compute the minimum cost for each query.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the code uses the prefix sums to determine the minimum cost efficiently.
   - The logic for determining the direction of traversal (`forward` or `backward`) is correct.

6. **Flaw in `func_1`**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city based on the unique closest city condition.
   - The logic should be revised to ensure that each city's closest city is uniquely identified.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. Therefore, the overall solution will not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
