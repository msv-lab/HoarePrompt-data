You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1]), and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Additionally, the function takes another parameter m, which is the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. Each x_i and y_i is an index into the cities list, satisfying 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and checks whether moving forward to the next city or backward to the previous city is closer. If moving forward is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city. Since the cities are in ascending order, moving forward will always be closer, so `prog_cities[i]` will be set to 1 for all valid indices i. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero as they do not have both a preceding and succeeding city to compare with.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and returns a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros.

```

Return Postconditions: `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
