Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to travel between any two cities, where the cost depends on the closest city rule and direct travel.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the "closest city" difference for each city except the first and last, which should always be zero because they don't have a closer city before or after them.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city. It incorrectly sets all values to either 1 or the absolute difference with the next city, without considering the actual closest city logic.
3. **Execution Summary**:
   - The execution summary states that the function returns a list of \(n-1\) ones, where \(n\) is the number of cities. This is incorrect because the function should return a list where each element represents the distance to the closest city, not just a constant value.
4. **Output Analysis**:
   - Given the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the overall program will produce incorrect results for the queries. The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are calculated based on incorrect data, leading to wrong outputs for the queries.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the logic to find the closest city for each city, resulting in incorrect prefix sums and thus incorrect answers for the queries.
