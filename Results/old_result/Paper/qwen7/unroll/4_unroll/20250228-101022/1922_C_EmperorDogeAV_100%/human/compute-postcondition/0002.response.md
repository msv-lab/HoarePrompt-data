Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 0 or 1 based on the condition specified in the loop. Specifically, for each city at index `i` (where 0 < i < n-1), `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1 if the distance to the next city (`cities[i+1]`) is closer than the distance to the previous city (`cities[i-1]`), otherwise it is set to the absolute difference between the distances to the next and previous cities. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` are always 0.
