cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the function is called with a valid number of test cases t (1 <= t <= 10^4) where each test case follows the described format.
