Output State: **`prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros**

Explanation: Given the initial state where `cities` is a list of n integers in ascending order and `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones with the first and last elements being zeros, the loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and checks the distance to the next city. Since the cities are in ascending order, moving forward to the next city is always closer. Therefore, for every valid index `i` in `prog_cities`, the value is set to 1. The first and last elements remain zero as specified. Thus, the final state of `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones with the first and last elements being zeros.
