Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros.

Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and checks whether moving forward to the next city or backward to the previous city is closer. If moving forward is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city. Since the cities are in ascending order, moving forward will always be closer, so `prog_cities[i]` will be set to 1 for all valid indices i. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero as they do not have both a preceding and succeeding city to compare with.
