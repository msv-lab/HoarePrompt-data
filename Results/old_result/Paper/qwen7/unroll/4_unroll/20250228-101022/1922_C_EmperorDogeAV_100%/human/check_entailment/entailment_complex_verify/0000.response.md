### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Preprocessing:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities (`n`), the coordinates of the cities (`cities`), and the number of queries (`m`).
   - It then calls `func_1` twice: once to find the closest city going forward and once to find the closest city going backward.
   - It computes prefix sums for both the forward and backward closest city lists.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed:
     - It initializes `back` to a very large negative value and `forward` to a very large positive value.
     - It then updates these values based on the previous and next city coordinates.
     - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):` is incorrect because it only considers the next city without checking the previous city properly.
     - Instead, it should check both the previous and next cities to determine the closest one.

3. **Prefix Sums Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are computed based on the results of `func_1`.
   - These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the minimum cost to travel between any two cities by either moving directly or using the closest city.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the code determines whether to use the forward or backward prefix sums based on the relative positions of the query cities.
   - It prints the minimum cost to travel between the two cities using the appropriate prefix sums.

Given the above analysis, the `func_1` function does not correctly determine the closest city for each position. The logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not properly identify the closest city. Therefore, the prefix sums computed using `func_1` will also be incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city to a given city, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

**Final: False**
