#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1]), and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Additionally, the function takes another parameter m, which is the number of queries, and a list of m pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the queries. Each x_i and y_i is an index into the cities list, satisfying 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n and x_i != y_i.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and checks whether moving forward to the next city or backward to the previous city is closer. If moving forward is closer, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city. Since the cities are in ascending order, moving forward will always be closer, so `prog_cities[i]` will be set to 1 for all valid indices i. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain zero as they do not have both a preceding and succeeding city to compare with.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of n-1 ones where the first and last elements are zeros
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of city coordinates in ascending order and returns a list of \(n-1\) ones, where \(n\) is the number of cities. The first and last elements of the returned list are zeros.
