### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.
   - It identifies the rating of the cow `k` (index `k-1` in the list).
   - It then iterates through the list to find the indices of the cows with ratings greater than `x` (the rating of cow `k`).
   - Depending on the number of such cows (`ind`), the function returns different values:
     - If no such cow exists (`ind == []`), it returns `n - 1`.
     - If there is exactly one such cow, it handles different cases based on the index of this cow relative to `k`.
     - If there are two such cows, it handles different cases based on the indices of these cows relative to `k`.

2. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where no cow has a higher rating than the cow at index `k-1` (returns `n - 1`).
   - It correctly handles the case where there is exactly one cow with a higher rating than the cow at index `k-1`:
     - If this cow is at index 0, it returns `k - 1`.
     - If this cow is at a position greater than `k`, it returns the position of this cow minus 1.
     - If this cow is at index 0 and the cow at index `k` has a lower rating, it returns the maximum of `k - 0` and `0 - 1`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where there are two cows with higher ratings than the cow at index `k-1`:
     - If the cow at index 0 has a higher rating, it returns the minimum of `ind[1] - 1` and `k - 1`.
     - If the cow at index 0 does not have a higher rating, it returns the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

3. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The function logic is consistent with the problem statement and the examples provided.
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum number of wins for the cow at index `k-1` by considering the optimal swaps and positions.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for the cow at index `k-1` based on the given constraints and examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
