You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, and 1 <= k <= n where k is the index of the cow owned by the user.
def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []

        #State: Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing exactly one index from the list `a` where the corresponding cow rating is greater than `x`. `a` is the original list of n distinct integers. `c` is the number of elements added to `ind` (at least 1). The current value of `len(ind)` is 1. `x` is the k-th element of the list `a`, and the first element of `ind` is not 0.

        #The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), given that ind[0] is not 0 and k (the element at index ind[1]) is greater than ind[1]
    #State: Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of at most two elements from the list `a` where the corresponding cow ratings are greater than `x`, `a` is the original list of n distinct integers, `c` is the number of elements added to `ind` (at least 1), and `x` is the k-th element of the list `a`. The length of `ind` is not equal to 1, and `ind[0]` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])
    #The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers. Based on certain conditions, it returns either n - 1, the value of the k-1th element in the list a, one less than the index stored in `ind[0]`, the value of k, the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` decreased by 1 and the index `k` decreased by 1, or the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]).

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns n - 1, where n is the number of distinct integers in the original list `a`.

Case_2: The program returns the value of x minus 1, which is the k-1th element in the list a.

Case_3: The program returns an integer which is one less than the index stored in `ind[0]`

Case_4: The program returns the value of k, which is the x-th element in list a.

Case_5: The program returns the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` decreased by 1 and the index `k` decreased by 1.

Case_6: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), given that ind[0] is not 0 and k (the element at index ind[1]) is greater than ind[1]

Case_7: The program returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0])
