You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:

    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of n distinct integers representing cow ratings and an index `k` indicating the position of a specific cow. It searches for indices of at most two cows in the list whose ratings are greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. Based on the results of this search, it returns one of seven possible values: `n - 1`, the rating of the cow at index `k-1`, one less than the index of a cow with a higher rating, the rating of the cow at index `k`, the minimum value between the second highest index and `k-1`, or the maximum difference between the indices of the two highest-rated cows found, adjusted based on their positions relative to `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the number of matches a specific cow (cow `k`) can win by potentially swapping its position with another cow before the matches begin.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - A cow can only win a match if its rating is higher than the opponent's.
   - The first match is always between the cows in positions 1 and 2.
   - Subsequent matches involve the cow that won the previous match and the next cow in line.

3. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`.
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows and calls the function `func_1` with these ratings.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of ratings `a` as input.
   - It identifies the rating of cow `k` (`x = a[k]`).
   - It then tries to find up to two positions where a cow has a higher rating than `x`.
   - Based on the positions found, it calculates the maximum number of matches cow `k` can win.

5. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - If no cow has a higher rating than `x`, the function returns `n - 1`, which is incorrect because the cow cannot win any matches.
   - If only one cow has a higher rating, the logic handles the edge cases correctly.
   - If two cows have higher ratings, the function calculates the maximum possible wins based on the positions of these cows.

6. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case, the function correctly identifies that doing nothing results in one win.
   - For the second test case, the function correctly identifies that swapping to position 3 results in two wins.
   - For the third test case, the function correctly identifies that no swaps result in zero wins.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of wins for cow `k`.
