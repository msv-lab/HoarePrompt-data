Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `a` and `b`:**
   - The variable `a` is used to store the number of test cases, but inside the loop, `a` is not being used correctly. Instead, you should use `b` which represents the number of moves.
   
2. **Incorrect Conditions for Printing 'Yes' or 'No':**
   - The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' are not correctly implemented. Specifically, the condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())  # Read number of moves and desired number of cubes
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage:
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input:** 
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `b` is the number of moves and `c` is the desired number of cubes.
  
- **Conditions:**
  - If the number of moves `b` is greater than or equal to the desired number of cubes `c`, and the difference `(b - c)` is even, then it is possible to achieve the desired number of cubes. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and an even difference means the operations can balance out.
  - Otherwise, it is not possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

This logic ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
