The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( b \) and \( c \). For each test case, it prints 'YES' if \( b \) equals \( c \), 'NO' if \( b \) is less than \( c \), 'Yes' if both \( b \) and \( a \) have the same parity (both even or both odd), and 'No' otherwise. The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) first, then iterates through each test case to perform these checks and print the corresponding result.
