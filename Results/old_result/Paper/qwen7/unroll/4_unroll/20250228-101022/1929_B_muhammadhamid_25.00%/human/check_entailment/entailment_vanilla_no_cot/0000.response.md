Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when `k` is greater than `2 * n`. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis:**
   - When `k == 1`, the solution prints `1`, which is correct.
   - When `k <= 2 * n`, the solution uses `math.ceil(k / 2)` to determine the minimum number of cells to color. This approach is incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal way to color cells to satisfy the condition for all diagonals.
   - When `k > 2 * n`, the solution prints `k // 2 + 1`, which is also incorrect. The logic here is flawed because it doesn't consider the structure of the diagonals in an `n x n` grid.

2. **Optimal Solution:**
   - For an `n x n` grid, we need to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The key observation is that each row and column can contribute to multiple diagonals. Specifically, each row and column can be used to cover diagonals in a structured manner.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # If k is less than or equal to 2*n, we can use the rows and columns to minimize the number of cells colored
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            # For k > 2*n, we need to color enough rows and columns to cover all required diagonals
            # We need to color at least n rows and columns to ensure all diagonals are covered
            min_cells = n + max(0, k - 2 * n)
            print(min_cells)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that the minimum number of cells are colored to meet the requirement of having at least `k` diagonals with at least one colored cell.
