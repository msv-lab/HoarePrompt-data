You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(n\) and \(k\). For each test case, it prints a specific value based on the conditions: if \(k = 1\), it prints 1; if \(k \leq 2n\), it prints \(\text{math.ceil}(k/2)\); otherwise, it prints \(\text{k} // 2 + 1\). After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of lines, each containing one of the aforementioned values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `4n - 2`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of diagonals in an `n x n` grid is `4n - 2`. However, the program attempts to calculate the minimum number of cells to color using `k // 2 + 1` when `k > 2 * n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 15
```
Here, `n = 4` and `k = 15`. The maximum number of diagonals is `4 * 4 - 2 = 14`. The program will incorrectly calculate the result as `15 // 2 + 1 = 8`, but the correct answer should be `4` because we can color the cells along the main diagonal and one other diagonal to satisfy the condition.

To fix this, the program should check if `k` exceeds `4n - 2` and handle it appropriately.
