Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (since `range(n)` starts from 0).
   - `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a string, we need to convert it to an integer to check this condition.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `j` is not involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `t` is not involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `b` is not involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `k` is not involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `i` is already set to 0, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 after conversion from string to integer.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

So, the final state is:

**State: **`j` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be a positive integer, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0**
