Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0.**

The code simply initializes `j` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
