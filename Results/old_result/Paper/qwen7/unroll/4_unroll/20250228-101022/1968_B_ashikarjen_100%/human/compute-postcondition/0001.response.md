Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code `a = input()` reads a line of input from the user. This line is stored in the variable `a`. Since the input is read as a string, `n` (which was supposed to be an integer) is now a string. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. The value of `m` also remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
