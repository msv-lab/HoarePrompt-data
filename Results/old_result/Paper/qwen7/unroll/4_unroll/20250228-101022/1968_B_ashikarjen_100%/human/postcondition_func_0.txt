The function reads input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from standard input. It then iterates through each character in `n` and checks if it exists in `b`. For each match found, it increments a counter `k`. After processing all characters in `n`, it prints the value of `k` and returns the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `k` as specified in the return postconditions.
