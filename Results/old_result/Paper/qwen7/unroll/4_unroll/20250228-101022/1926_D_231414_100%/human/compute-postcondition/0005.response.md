Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list of n non-negative integers a_1, ..., a_n (each less than 2^31). The function returns a result based on the input for each test case, where the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes each test case individually and returns a result for each, adhering to the given constraints.
