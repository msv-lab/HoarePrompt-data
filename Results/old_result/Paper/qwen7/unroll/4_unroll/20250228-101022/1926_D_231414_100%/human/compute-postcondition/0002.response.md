Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder) and `times`. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable when the index itself is not needed within the loop body.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0. If `times` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `times` must be greater than 0. The other variables (`t` and `check`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted for this specific condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `times`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0**
