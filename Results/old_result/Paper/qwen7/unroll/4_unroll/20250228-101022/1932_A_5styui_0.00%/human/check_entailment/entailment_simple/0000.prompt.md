Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
During your journey through computer universes, you stumbled upon a very
interesting world. It is a path with n consecutive cells, each of which can
either be empty, contain thorns, or a coin. In one move, you can move one or
two cells along the path, provided that the destination cell does not contain
thorns (and belongs to the path). If you move to the cell with a coin, you
pick it up.

Here, green arrows correspond to legal moves, and the red arrow corresponds to
an illegal move.

You want to collect as many coins as possible. Find the maximum number of
coins you can collect in the discovered world if you start in the leftmost
cell of the path.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the
number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the length of the path.

The second line of each test case contains a string of n characters, the
description of the path. The character '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes
a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. It is guaranteed that
the first cell is empty.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer, the maximum number of coins you
can collect.

Example

Input

    10
    
    .@@*@.**@@
    
    5
    
    .@@@@
    
    15
    
    .@@..@***..@@@*

Output

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.') and the string does not contain consecutive '*'s.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    s = 0
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s = s + 1
            elif b[j] == '*':
                if b[:]:
                    break
                elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                    break
        
        print(s)
        
        s = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop processes each value of `i` from 0 to `a-1`. For each iteration, it reads an integer `d` and a string `b`. It then iterates through each character of `b`, counting occurrences of the '@' character and breaking out of the inner loop under certain conditions. After processing `b`, it prints the count of '@' characters and resets `s` to 0 for the next iteration. Since `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration, the final value of `s` will always be 0 regardless of the input. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for `s`.
