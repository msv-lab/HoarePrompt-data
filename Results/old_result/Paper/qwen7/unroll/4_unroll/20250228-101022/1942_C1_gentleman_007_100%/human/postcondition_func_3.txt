The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( m \), and \( v \), where \( n \) represents the number of sides of a polygon, \( m \) represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and \( v \) represents the number of vertices you can choose (which is always 0). It returns a 2D list with \( n \) rows and \( m \) columns, where each element in the list is 0.
