The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a list of lists `l`, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. These elements are indices of other sublists in `l` and are connected bidirectionally. The function constructs these connections by iterating `m` times, appending one of the indices returned by `func_1()` to the corresponding sublist in `l` and ensuring the same index is added to the corresponding sublist, thus creating bidirectional connections.
