Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop condition is `p <= num`.

2. **Determine the Current State:**
   - `p` is currently 2.
   - `num` is a non-negative integer.
   - `prime[0]` is False.
   - `prime[1]` is False.
   - `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0.
   - `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0.

3. **Check the Loop Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `p <= num` must be true.
   - Currently, `p` is 2.
   - Therefore, `num` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since `p` is 2, the only variable that needs to be adjusted is `num`.
   - `num` must be greater than or equal to 2.

### Final Answer:
State: **`p` is 2, `num` is a non-negative integer and must be greater than or equal to 2; `prime[0]` is False, `prime[1]` is False; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0.**
