Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it simply repeats the first `k` lowercase letters `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the generated string. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to construct a string that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. One effective way to do this is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of length `n` appears exactly once.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def de_bruijn(k, n):
    def db(t, p):
        if t == n:
            for j in range(n - p + 1):
                yield ''.join(path[j:j + p])
        else:
            for c in range(k):
                path[t] = c
                for d in db(t + 1, p):
                    yield d

    path = [0] * (n + 1)
    return ' '.join(db(0, n + 1))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    result = de_bruijn(k, n)
    print(result)
```

This program uses a generator function to create a de Bruijn sequence, ensuring that all subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are included.
