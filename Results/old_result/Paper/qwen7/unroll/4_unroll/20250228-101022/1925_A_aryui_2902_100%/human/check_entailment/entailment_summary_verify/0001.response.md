### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided solution based on the function summary and the requirements.

1. **Problem Requirements**: We need to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets is a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Function Summary**: The function `func_1` generates a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet ('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'), repeated `n` times.

3. **Analysis of the Solution**:
   - For `n=1` and `k=2`, the solution generates "ab" repeated once, which is "ab". This is correct because "a" and "b" are subsequences of "ab".
   - For `n=2` and `k=1`, the solution generates "a" repeated twice, which is "aa". This is correct because "aa" is the only possible string of length 2 using the first letter "a".
   - For `n=2` and `k=2`, the solution generates "ab" repeated once, which is "ab". This is not sufficient to ensure that all combinations like "ba" are subsequences. However, the function summary does not guarantee that the order or combinations are maintained.
   - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the solution generates "abc" repeated once, which is "abc". This is not sufficient to cover all combinations like "ab", "ac", "bc", "acb", etc.

The key issue is that the function summary does not specify how the repetitions are arranged to ensure all combinations are subsequences. The solution simply repeats the first `k` characters `n` times, which does not inherently guarantee that all combinations will be subsequences.

To meet the problem requirements, the generated string must include all possible combinations of length `n` from the first `k` characters. The provided solution does not ensure this.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly points out that the current implementation does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
