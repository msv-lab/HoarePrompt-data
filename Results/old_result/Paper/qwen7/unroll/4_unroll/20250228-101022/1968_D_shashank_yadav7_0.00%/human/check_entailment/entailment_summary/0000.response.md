Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each one.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the necessary inputs including the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3. The program initializes the starting positions for Bodya and Sasha, adjusting them to zero-based indices.
4. It then calculates the maximum possible scores for both players over `k` turns. This involves:
   - Moving to the new position based on the permutation `p`.
   - Accumulating the score for each position visited.
   - Using the `max` function to ensure the score reflects the best possible outcome for each player.
5. After calculating the scores, the program correctly compares them and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the detailed logic and the correct handling of the problem constraints, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
