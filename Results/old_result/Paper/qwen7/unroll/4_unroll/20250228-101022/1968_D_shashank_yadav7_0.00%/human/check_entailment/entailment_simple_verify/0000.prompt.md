You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input set, the output will either be 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison between `bm` and `sm`. Since the input values are not specified, the final output state cannot be determined precisely without knowing the specific inputs. However, it will consist of a sequence of 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' outputs corresponding to each input set provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate the issue:

### Counterexample:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3 3 1 2
  3 1 2
  10 2 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 1.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's position: 1 → 3 (since \(p_1 = 3\))
    - Sasha's position: 2 → 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\))
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's position: 3 → 2 (since \(p_3 = 2\))
    - Sasha's position: 1 → 2 (since \(p_1 = 2\))
  - After the third turn:
    - Bodya's position: 2 → 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\))
    - Sasha's position: 2 → 3 (since \(p_2 = 3\))

- **Expected Scores:**
  - Bodya's score: \(a_1 + a_3 + a_2 = 10 + 5 + 2 = 17\)
  - Sasha's score: \(a_2 + a_1 + a_3 = 2 + 10 + 5 = 17\)

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the scores and outputs "Draw" instead of checking the final scores accurately.

### Issue in the Program:
The program incorrectly accumulates the scores in a way that doesn't reflect the actual game rules. Specifically, the scores are updated without properly considering the sequence of moves and the maximum possible score at each step.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly simulate the game, the program should:
1. Initialize the starting positions and scores.
2. Simulate each turn, updating positions and scores based on the rules.
3. Ensure the scores are updated correctly for each possible move.

Since the provided program does not handle the game logic correctly, it fails to produce the expected output for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
