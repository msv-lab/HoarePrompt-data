Output State: The output state depends on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program compares the maximum possible scores `bm` (Bodya's score) and `sm` (Sasha's score) based on the given rules and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' accordingly. After all iterations, the final printed result for each iteration will be the output state.
