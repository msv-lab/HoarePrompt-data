Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing this line of code, `t` retains its properties but now also holds the specific value input by the user. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) are not mentioned in the initial state and are not affected by this line of code.
