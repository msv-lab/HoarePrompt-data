Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of one iteration of the loop. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` where `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic sequence and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for the remaining elements.
