You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). If \( a \geq b \), it prints \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it calculates and prints the sum of an arithmetic sequence and a linear sequence.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum profit for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the modified price `b` is less than the usual price `a` and `k` is set to `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This can lead to incorrect results.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = 10`, `b = 8`

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to sell the first `k` buns at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` and the rest at the usual price `a`. Here, `k = min(8 - 10 + 1, 5) = 0`, which means no buns are sold at the modified price. However, the program incorrectly calculates `k` as `min(8 - 10 + 1, 5) = 0` and then proceeds to calculate the profit as `ans + p2`, where `ans` is `0` and `p2` is `5 * 10 = 50`. The correct profit should be `8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 40`.

The program does not handle the case where `k` should be greater than 0 when `b < a`, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
