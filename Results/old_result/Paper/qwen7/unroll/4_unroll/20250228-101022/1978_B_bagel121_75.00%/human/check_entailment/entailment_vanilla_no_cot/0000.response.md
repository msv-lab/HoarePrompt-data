Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all the buns under the given promotion rules. Let's break down the solution to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, then it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is handled by the condition `if a >= b`.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The value of `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`, which ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns `n` or the range from `b - a + 1`.

3. **Calculating Profit**:
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` is simply `(n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is the sum of these two values: `ans + p2`.

Given the example test cases, the program produces the correct output, confirming its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct.
