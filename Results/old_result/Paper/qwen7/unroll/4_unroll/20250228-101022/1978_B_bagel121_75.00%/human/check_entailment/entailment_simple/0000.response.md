Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case and reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic to calculate the maximum profit is as follows:
   - If `a >= b`, the profit is simply `n * a` because there's no benefit in applying the promotion.
   - If `a < b`, the optimal strategy is to apply the promotion to the first `k` buns where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
     - The price of the `i-th` bun (for `1 <= i <= k`) is `(b - i + 1)`.
     - The total profit from the first `k` buns is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
     - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `p2 = (n - k) * a` to the total profit.
     - The final profit is `ans + p2`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
