State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i < t`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid integer because the `range()` function requires an integer argument.
3. Additionally, `t` must be within the specified range (1 to \(10^4\)) to ensure the loop runs the correct number of times.
4. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `t` is an integer within the specified range and `i` is set to 0.
