### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its function `func_2` to determine if it correctly simulates the pinball's movement and inversion rules as described in the problem statement.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Movement Rules**: The pinball moves left or right based on the current character and then inverts the character.
2. **Inversion**: The character changes from `<` to `>` or vice versa after each move.
3. **Stopping Condition**: The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

#### Function `func_2` Breakdown:
- **Initialization**:
  - `pre` stores the indices where the character is `>`.
  - `totalOne` counts the number of `>` characters.
  - `preOne` accumulates the prefix sums of `pre`.
  - `suffZero` stores suffix sums of indices where the character is `<`.
  
- **Main Logic**:
  - The loop iterates backward through the string `s1`.
  - For each character, it calculates the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid based on the balance of `>` and `<` characters.
  - The calculations involve using `func_1` to compute certain values based on the accumulated sums.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Accumulation and Sums**:
   - `preOne` and `suffZero` are used to keep track of the cumulative positions of `>` and `<` respectively.
   - These sums help in calculating the distance traveled by the pinball and the number of steps taken.

2. **Time Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the calculation of `ans[i]` is designed to account for the distance traveled and the number of steps required to reach the boundary.
   - The logic handles both cases where the pinball is moving towards a `>` or a `<` character and updates the positions accordingly.

3. **Inversion Handling**:
   - The inversion of characters is implicitly handled by the way the sums are accumulated and used to calculate the distances.
   - Each time the pinball moves, the character is effectively inverted, and the accumulated sums are updated to reflect this change.

#### Verification with Example:
Consider the example `s = "<><<>"`:
- Initial grid: `"<><<>"`
- Expected output: `1 4 7 10 8 1`

Let's trace the pinball movement for each starting position:
- **Starting at index 0 (`<`)**:
  - Move right to index 1 (`>`), time = 1.
  - Invert to `<`, move right to index 2 (`>`), time = 2.
  - Invert to `<`, move right to index 3 (`>`), time = 3.
  - Invert to `<`, move right to index 4 (`>`), time = 4.
  - Invert to `<`, move right to index 5 (`>`), time = 5.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 4 (`>`), time = 6.
  - Invert to `>`, move left to index 3 (`>`), time = 7.
  - Invert to `>`, move left to index 2 (`>`), time = 8.
  - Invert to `>`, move left to index 1 (`>`), time = 9.
  - Invert to `>`, move left to index 0 (`>`), time = 10.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index -1 (out of bounds), time = 11.
  - Output: `11` (but the expected is `1`).

- **Starting at index 1 (`>`)**:
  - Move right to index 2 (`>`), time = 1.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 1 (`>`), time = 2.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 0 (`>`), time = 3.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index -1 (out of bounds), time = 4.
  - Output: `4` (expected is `4`).

- **Starting at index 2 (`>`)**:
  - Move right to index 3 (`>`), time = 1.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 2 (`>`), time = 2.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 1 (`>`), time = 3.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 0 (`>`), time = 4.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index -1 (out of bounds), time = 5.
  - Output: `5` (expected is `7`).

- **Starting at index 3 (`>`)**:
  - Move right to index 4 (`>`), time = 1.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 3 (`>`), time = 2.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 2 (`>`), time = 3.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 1 (`>`), time = 4.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 0 (`>`), time = 5.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index -1 (out of bounds), time = 6.
  - Output: `6` (expected is `10`).

- **Starting at index 4 (`>`)**:
  - Move right to index 5 (`>`), time = 1.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 4 (`>`), time = 2.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 3 (`>`), time = 3.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 2 (`>`), time = 4.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 1 (`>`), time = 5.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 0 (`>`), time = 6.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index -1 (out of bounds), time = 7.
  - Output: `7` (expected is `8`).

- **Starting at index 5 (`>`)**:
  - Move left to index 4 (`>`), time = 1.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 3 (`>`), time = 2.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 2 (`>`), time = 3.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 1 (`>`), time = 4.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index 0 (`>`), time = 5.
  - Invert to `<`, move left to index -1 (out of bounds), time = 6.
  - Output: `6` (expected is `1`).

From the above analysis, it appears that the program does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and inversion rules. The calculations do not match the expected outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and inversion rules, leading to incorrect outputs.
