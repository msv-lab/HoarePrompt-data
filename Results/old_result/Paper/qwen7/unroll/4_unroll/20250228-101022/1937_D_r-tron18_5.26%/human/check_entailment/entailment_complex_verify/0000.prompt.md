You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

    #
    #To explain in natural language:
    #After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans` list will contain values determined by the conditions inside the loop for each character in `s1`. The `preOne` and `pre` lists will be empty because they are being modified and reduced in size within the loop. The `totalOne` variable will be 0 since it is decremented in each iteration of the loop. The `suffZero` list remains unchanged as it is only appended to in the case of the '<' character, which does not occur in the final iterations of the loop.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: [values determined by the conditions inside the loop]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` where each element is determined based on the balance of '<' and '>' in `s1` relative to `n`. The final state of the program includes an output list `ans` containing the calculated values, while internal lists `preOne`, `pre`, and `suffZero` are emptied, and `totalOne` is set to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the given rules. Specifically, the program attempts to use a complex accumulation-based approach to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, but this approach does not accurately reflect the pinball's movement and the inversion of the grid characters.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- For the input `s = "<><<>"` (i.e., the grid is `"<><<>"`), the expected output should be `1 4 7 10 8 1`.

However, the provided program does not correctly handle the inversion of the grid characters and the movement of the pinball. For instance, when the pinball starts at position 2 (the third character from the left, which is `>`), it should move to the right, but the program's logic does not account for the correct sequence of movements and inversions.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. The program uses a complex accumulation method to calculate positions, but it does not properly handle the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
2. The logic for determining the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the pinball's movement and the inversion of characters.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the described behavior for the pinball's movement and thus is incorrect.
