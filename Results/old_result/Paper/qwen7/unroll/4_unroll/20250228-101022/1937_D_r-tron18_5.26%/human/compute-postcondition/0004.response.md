Output State: **`ans` is a list of length `totalOne` filled with zeros, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` with an initial 0 added at the beginning, `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s1` plus one, `totalOne` is the number of elements in the list `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of zeros with a length equal to `totalOne`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
