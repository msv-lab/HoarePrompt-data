The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `times`. It calculates and returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index which is the maximum of -1 and -1 minus `times`. If `times` is 0, it returns the difference between the last two elements. If `times` is greater than 0, it returns the difference between the last element and the element at the index `-1 - times`, ensuring the index does not go out of bounds.
