Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, k, x, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases implicitly through its body. For each test case, it receives a positive integer `t` (though `t` is not used in the description of the return values), and then three more integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, along with a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. Based on these inputs, the function performs some operations and returns a result specific to each test case.
