Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.
2. **Sorting**: The list `a` is sorted in descending order, which is a crucial step for both Alice and Bob to play optimally.
3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum of the array (`ans1`) is calculated correctly.
4. **Alice's Removal**: Alice removes the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the sum. This is done by subtracting twice the value of the smallest `k` elements from `ans1`.
5. **Bob's Negation**: Bob negates the largest elements to minimize the sum. This is done by subtracting twice the value of the largest `x` elements from `ans1` and adding them back with their original value.
6. **Optimal Strategy**: The program checks both scenarios (removing elements first and then negating elements) and selects the maximum possible sum, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
7. **Output**: The program prints the maximum sum for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob play their moves.

Correctness: **True**
