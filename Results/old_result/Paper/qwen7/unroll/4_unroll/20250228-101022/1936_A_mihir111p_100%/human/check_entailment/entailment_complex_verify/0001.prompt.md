You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) within the range \([0, n)\), where \(n\) is a positive integer between 2 and \(10^4\). It prints these parameters and then waits for user input, returning the input value, which is also a non-negative integer within the same range \([0, n)\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_0 | p_i)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. This comparison helps in finding a candidate index `i` such that `(p_0 | p_i)` is maximized.
   - After finding a candidate index `i`, it updates `ans1` to this index.

3. **Further Refinement:**
   - The program initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` as a list containing 0.
   - It iterates through indices from 1 to `n-1` again and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_mx | p_i)` with `(p_ans1 | p_i)`.
     - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and sets `mx` to the current index `i`.
     - If the result is `=`, it appends the current index `i` to `v`.
   - After this loop, `mx` is set to the first element of `v`, and `ans` is also set to the first element of `v`.

4. **Final Selection:**
   - The program iterates through the elements of `v` and uses the `func_1` function to compare `(p_ans | p_v[i])` with `(p_ans | p_v[i])` to ensure `ans` is indeed the correct index.
   - It prints the final answer as `! ans ans1`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used incorrectly in the comparisons. Specifically, the comparisons should involve actual values from the permutation array `p`, but the function only takes indices and does not access the permutation array.

2. **Logic Flaws:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is flawed. The approach of comparing `(p_a | p_b)` with `(p_c | p_d)` does not necessarily help in finding the maximum XOR pair directly. The program should focus on comparing individual elements to find the maximum XOR.

3. **Missing Permutation Array Access:**
   - The program does not actually access the permutation array `p` to perform the necessary comparisons. Instead, it relies on the `func_1` function, which is not correctly implemented to handle the permutation array.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
