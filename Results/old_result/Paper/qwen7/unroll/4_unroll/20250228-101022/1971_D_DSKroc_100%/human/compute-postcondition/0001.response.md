Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `q` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `t` is given as an input, and it is a positive integer between 1 and 500. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
   - The variable `q` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, for the first iteration, `q` should be 0.

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `t` is initially set to an input value, we need to ensure that this value is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `q` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (it must be at least 1) and `q` (it must be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be at least 1, `q` is 0**
