You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
        res = 0
        for i in range(n):
            res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
        print(res, n << 1)
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
            print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)). For each test case, it calculates a value \( res \) based on a specific formula involving \( n \), and prints this value along with \( n \) left-shifted by 1 bit. It then prints two lines for each row index from \( n \) down to 1, each line starting with either '1' or '2' followed by the row index and the sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( j \). This ensures that the first column of the matrix is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \). This sum is derived from the fact that the maximum possible sum is achieved when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - It performs \( n \) operations of type 1 (permuting rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (permuting columns) to achieve the desired permutations.

3. **Verification**:
   - The sum calculation is correct because each element \( a_{i, j} \) will eventually be part of the sum, and the sum is maximized when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.
   - The operations performed ensure that each row and column is a permutation, thus maximizing the sum.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix and uses no more than \( 2n \) operations.
