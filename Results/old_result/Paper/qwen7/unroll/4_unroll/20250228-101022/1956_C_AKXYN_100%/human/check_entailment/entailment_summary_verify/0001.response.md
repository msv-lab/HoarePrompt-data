Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( j \). This ensures that the first column of the matrix is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \). This sum is derived from the fact that the maximum possible sum is achieved when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - It performs \( n \) operations of type 1 (permuting rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (permuting columns) to achieve the desired permutations.

3. **Verification**:
   - The sum calculation is correct because each element \( a_{i, j} \) will eventually be part of the sum, and the sum is maximized when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.
   - However, the implementation of the operations is incorrect. The matrix is initialized such that the first column is a permutation, but the subsequent elements are not necessarily permutations. Specifically, the matrix is initialized with the first column being a permutation and the rest of the elements being the same as the column index, which does not ensure that each row and column is a permutation.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- For \( n = 2 \), the matrix initialization would be:
  ```
  [[1, 1],
   [2, 2]]
  ```
  This matrix does not have all rows and columns as permutations.

Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix by ensuring that each row and column is a permutation.

Final: **False**
