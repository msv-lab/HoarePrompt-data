### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( j \). This ensures that the first column of the matrix is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \). However, this sum is incorrect. The correct approach would be to calculate the sum of the matrix after performing the operations.
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - It performs \( n \) operations of type 1 (permuting rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (permuting columns) to achieve the desired permutations.

3. **Verification**:
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The correct sum should be the sum of all elements in the matrix after performing the operations. Since each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \), the sum of each row and each column is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \). Therefore, the total sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.
   - The operations performed ensure that each row and column is a permutation, thus maximizing the sum.

4. **Evaluating the Given Solution**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly calculate the sum of the matrix. The sum is incorrectly calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \), which does not reflect the actual sum of the matrix after the operations.
   - The operations performed are correct in terms of achieving the permutations, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the sum calculation in the provided solution is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} \).

**Final: False**
