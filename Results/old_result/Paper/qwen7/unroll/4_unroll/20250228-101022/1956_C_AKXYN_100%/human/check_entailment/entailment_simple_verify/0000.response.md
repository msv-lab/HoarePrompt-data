### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and its behavior compared to the problem requirements.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. **Operations**: Two types of operations are allowed:
   - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
   - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
2. **Objective**: Maximize the sum of all elements in the \( n \times n \) matrix.
3. **Constraints**: No more than \( 2n \) operations.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Matrix Initialization**:
   ```python
   mat = [list(range(1, n + 1)) for i in range(n)]
   ```
   This line initializes the matrix such that each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \). For example, for \( n = 3 \):
   ```
   [[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
   ```

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   ```python
   res = 0
   for i in range(n):
       res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)
   ```
   This loop calculates a sum based on a formula, which does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through operations.

3. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(res, n << 1)
   for i in range(n, 0, -1):
       print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
       print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```
   - The sum `res` is printed, which is not related to the matrix sum.
   - For each row index `i` from `n` down to `1`, two operations are printed:
     - A Type 1 operation on row `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - A Type 2 operation on column `i` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum `res` calculated in the loop is not relevant to the problem's objective. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements, not some unrelated sum.

2. **Operations**:
   - The operations printed are indeed Type 1 and Type 2 operations, but they do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix elements. The initial matrix is already a permutation matrix, and applying these operations repeatedly does not change the sum of the matrix.

3. **Maximum Sum**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by ensuring that the largest numbers are placed in the top-left corner. However, the program does not achieve this. Instead, it simply prints a series of operations that do not affect the sum optimally.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
