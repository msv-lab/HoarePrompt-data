Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution initializes a matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) for each row.
   - It then calculates a value `res` which seems to be derived from a specific formula involving \( n \).
   - For each row index from \( n \) down to 1, it performs two operations: one permuting the row and one permuting the corresponding column.
   - The operations are structured such that the first operation sets the row values and the second operation sets the column values.
3. **Verification**:
   - The calculation of `res` as \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \) is correct for the initial matrix configuration.
   - The operations ensure that each element in the matrix is set to its maximum possible value (i.e., \( n \) for the main diagonal and decreasing values for other positions).
   - The total number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix elements and adheres to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
