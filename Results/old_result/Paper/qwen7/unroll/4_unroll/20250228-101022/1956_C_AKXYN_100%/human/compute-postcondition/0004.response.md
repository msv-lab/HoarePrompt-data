Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)). For each test case, it calculates a value \( res \) based on a specific formula involving \( n \), and prints this value along with \( n \) left-shifted by 1 bit. It then prints two lines for each row index from \( n \) down to 1, each line starting with either '1' or '2' followed by the row index and the sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \). The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
