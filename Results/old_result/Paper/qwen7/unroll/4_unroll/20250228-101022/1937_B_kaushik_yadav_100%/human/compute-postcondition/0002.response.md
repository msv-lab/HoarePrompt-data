Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer read from input and the range is given as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The initial state of `t` is given as an integer within the specified range. To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
