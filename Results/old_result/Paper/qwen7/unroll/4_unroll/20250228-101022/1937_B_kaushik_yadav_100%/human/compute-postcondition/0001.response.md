Output State: **`t` is an integer read from input, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and remains unchanged; two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are provided, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1.**

The code reads an integer `t` from the input, which updates the value of `t` to the integer input. The values of `n`, the two binary strings, and the upper limit constraints remain unchanged.
