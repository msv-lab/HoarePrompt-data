Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and two binary strings `a_{11}a_{12}…a_{1n}` and `a_{21}a_{22}…a_{2n}` are provided, where each `a_{ij}` is either 0 or 1. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5; input function is now used to read input from stdin.**

Explanation: The code simply changes the way input is read from `sys.stdin.readline` without affecting the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the binary strings. The precondition remains the same, and the input reading method is updated.
