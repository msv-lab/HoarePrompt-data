You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(k - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100. Additionally, a list of n integers representing the numbers on the cards is provided for each test case, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500. For each iteration i in the range of t, two integers n and k are read, followed by a list of n integers. The code then prints k - 1. After all iterations, the output consists of t lines, each containing a single integer which is k - 1 for the corresponding iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of n integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). It then prints k - 1 for each test case, resulting in t lines of output, each containing a single integer which is k - 1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, the goal is to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards. However, the program simply prints `k - 1` without considering the actual distribution of card numbers.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5 3
4 1 1 4 4
```
The expected output should be `2`, as we can exchange the three `4`s for two new cards. However, the program will output `2 - 1 = 1`, which is incorrect.

Another example is:
```
7 2
4 2 1 100 5 2 3
```
The expected output here is `1`, as we can exchange all pairs of cards with the same number, leaving only one card. But the program will output `2 - 1 = 1`, which is correct in this case but does not handle the general logic of minimizing the number of cards.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description.
