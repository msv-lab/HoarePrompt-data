Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual distribution of card numbers. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations. However, the program does not account for the different numbers on the cards and their counts, which is necessary to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain.

The program should:
1. Count the occurrences of each card number.
2. Determine how many full sets of `k` cards can be formed for each unique number.
3. Calculate the remainder of cards that cannot form a full set of `k`.
4. Sum up the minimum number of cards that can remain for each unique number.

Given this analysis, the provided program is incorrect because it does not perform these necessary steps.

Correctness: **False**
