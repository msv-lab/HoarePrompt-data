Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function simply prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual numbers on the cards or performing the operations as specified. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards left after performing the allowed operations. However, the current implementation does not take into account the values of the cards or the possibility of merging cards with the same value to achieve the minimum number of cards.

The function should group the cards by their values, count how many groups of `k` cards exist, and then calculate the remaining cards after performing the operations optimally. The provided function does not do this, hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
