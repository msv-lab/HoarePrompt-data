Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, which is not the correct approach. According to the problem statement, the goal is to minimize the number of cards left, not to always print `k - 1`.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to count the occurrences of each card number and then determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be fully grouped into sets of `k`. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the occurrences of each card number
        card_counts = {}
        for card in l:
            if card in card_counts:
                card_counts[card] += 1
            else:
                card_counts[card] = 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
        min_cards_left = sum(1 for count in card_counts.values() if count % k != 0)
        print(min_cards_left)

func()
```

This program correctly counts the occurrences of each card number and calculates the minimum number of cards that cannot be fully grouped into sets of `k`, thus providing the correct solution to the problem.
