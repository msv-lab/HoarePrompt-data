### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - It then reads the dimensions of the board (`r`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).

2. **Basic Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if Alice's row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's row position (`c`). If true, it directly prints "Draw". This condition is correct because if Alice is already below Bob, Bob can never catch up, so the game is a draw.

3. **Detailed Logic for Winning Conditions**:
   - The logic calculates the difference in row positions (`abs(a - c)`).
   - If this difference is odd, it calculates the possible range for Alice's chip (`l` and `r`) based on the middle point between Alice and Bob.
   - It then checks if Bob's column position (`b`) falls within this range plus one extra cell to account for diagonal moves. If it does, Alice can win; otherwise, it's a draw.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the possible range for Bob's chip similarly and checks if Alice's column position (`d`) falls within this range. If it does, Bob can win; otherwise, it's a draw.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the calculated ranges might extend beyond the board boundaries (using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`).
   - However, there are some issues with the logic for determining the winning conditions:
     - When the difference `abs(a - c)` is odd, the logic calculates the range for Alice's chip correctly, but it incorrectly assumes that Bob can win if `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1`. This is not always true because Bob's moves are restricted to vertical and diagonal moves, and the range should be checked more carefully.
     - Similarly, when the difference is even, the logic calculates the range for Bob's chip correctly, but it incorrectly assumes that Alice can win if `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x`. Again, this is not always true due to the same reasons.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program uses `print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[condition])` to format the output, which is correct for the given problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical errors in determining the winning conditions. Specifically, the ranges calculated for Alice and Bob are not correctly accounting for the constraints of the game. The program incorrectly assumes that Bob can win if his column position falls within the calculated range, and similarly, it incorrectly assumes that Alice can win under certain conditions.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
