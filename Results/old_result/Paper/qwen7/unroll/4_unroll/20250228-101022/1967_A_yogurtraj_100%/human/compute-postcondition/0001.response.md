Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, after all iterations of the loop, r is the final value of the smallest card type after applying the operations, rem is the remaining value of k after the loop, y is the count of operations applied to the last segment of the sorted list, and the output is calculated based on these values.
