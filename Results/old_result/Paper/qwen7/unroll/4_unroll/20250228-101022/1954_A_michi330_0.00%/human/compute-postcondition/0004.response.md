Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined conditions involving positive integers t, n, m, and k where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, 1 ≤ m, k ≤ n ≤ 50.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but seems to work with values (t, n, m, k) that are defined elsewhere and must satisfy specific constraints. The function evaluates these values and returns a result based on the given conditions.
