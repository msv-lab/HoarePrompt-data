Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and adjusts `k` based on whether each element is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to zero after adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.**
