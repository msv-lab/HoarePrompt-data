Output State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m and i^2 ≤ n + i after calling `func_7()` which assigns new values to `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` to 0. No changes are made to `i`, `n`, or `m`. The precondition that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the specified range, and the relationship between `i`, `n`, and `m` remains unchanged. The function `func_7()` is called, which will modify `n` and `m`, but the exact values are not specified in the given code snippet.
