Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= m and i * i <= n + i`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop condition).
   - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \leq i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\) after calling `func_7()`.

3. **Check the loop condition with current state**:
   - The first part of the condition is `i <= m`. Since `i` is 1, this part is already satisfied as long as `m` is at least 1.
   - The second part of the condition is `i * i <= n + i`. Substituting `i = 1`, we get \(1^2 \leq n + 1\), which simplifies to \(1 \leq n + 1\). This is always true because `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since both parts of the loop condition are already satisfied with the current state (`i` is 1 and `n` and `m` are positive integers), no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \leq i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\) after calling `func_7()`**
