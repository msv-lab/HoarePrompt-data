Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided in each iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify the exact input values for `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` for each iteration, it's impossible to provide a specific output state without additional information. Each iteration of the loop processes the input values according to the conditions specified and prints the result. The final output state will be a series of printed results from each iteration.
