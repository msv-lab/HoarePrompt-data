Output State: **`pos` is an empty list, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements`.**

The code calculates the sum of all integers in the list `elements` and assigns it to the variable `s`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
