Output State: `pos` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, with `s` being the current sum of the list `elements` excluding the last `i` elements, and `s2` being the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements from the end of `elements`. `removals` is reduced by 1 after each iteration, `negatives` remains unchanged, and `elements` is modified by removing the last `i` elements during each iteration.
