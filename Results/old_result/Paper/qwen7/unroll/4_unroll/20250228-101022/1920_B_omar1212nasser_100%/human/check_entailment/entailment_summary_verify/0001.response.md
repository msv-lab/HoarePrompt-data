### Reasoning

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and flow of the program. Let's break down the key points to ensure the correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - Sorts the array `a` before passing it to `func_2`.
   - This sorting step is crucial because it allows Alice to optimally remove the smallest elements and Bob to optimally negate the largest elements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Takes the sorted array and computes the possible sums after Alice and Bob make their moves.
   - It correctly handles the removal of elements and the negation of elements.
   - The logic of updating `s` and `s2` ensures that the program considers all possible scenarios where Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob negates up to `negatives` elements.
   - The function returns the maximum possible sum, which is the optimal solution.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to minimize the impact on the total sum.
   - Bob should negate the largest remaining elements to minimize the sum further.
   - The function `func_2` correctly implements this strategy by considering all possible combinations of removals and negations.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `removals` or `negatives` are equal to the length of the array. In such cases, the function still correctly computes the optimal sum.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the program.
