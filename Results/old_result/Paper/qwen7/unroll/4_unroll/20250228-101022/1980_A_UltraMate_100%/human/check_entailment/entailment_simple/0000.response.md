### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.
   
2. **Counter Initialization**: A `Counter` object `hmp` is created to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Initial Calculation**: 
   - The first loop iterates over the difficulty levels 'ABCDEFG'. If a difficulty level is not present in `hmp`, it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
   - The second loop iterates over the keys in `hmp`. If the count of a difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans` to account for the additional problems needed.

4. **Output**: The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case, which represents the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure each round has at least one problem of each difficulty level.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
