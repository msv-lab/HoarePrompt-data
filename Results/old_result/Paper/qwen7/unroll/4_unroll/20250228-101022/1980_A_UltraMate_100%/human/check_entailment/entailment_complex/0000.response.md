Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the string `s`.

2. **Character Count Calculation**: The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in the string `s`. This ensures that it accurately keeps track of how many times each difficulty level appears.

3. **Additional Problems Calculation**:
   - For each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'), it checks if the count in `hmp` is less than `m`.
   - If the count is less than `m`, it adds the difference (`m - hmp[i]`) to `ans`. This step ensures that the program calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of having `m` rounds.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the provided program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
