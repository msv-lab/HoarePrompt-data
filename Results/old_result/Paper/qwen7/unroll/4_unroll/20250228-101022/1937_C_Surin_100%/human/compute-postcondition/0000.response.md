Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, the function I is defined as a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `I` that processes input from the user. It does not assign any new values to existing variables or change their states. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the definition of the lambda function `I` is added.
