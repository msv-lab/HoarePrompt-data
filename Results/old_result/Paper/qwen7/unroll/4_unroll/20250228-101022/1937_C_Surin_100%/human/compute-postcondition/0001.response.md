Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `R` is a lambda function that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input, splits it by spaces, and maps each element to an integer. This does not affect the value of `t`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and `R` is the newly defined lambda function.
