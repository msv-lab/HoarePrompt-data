Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes the main loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Query Generation**:
   - The program starts by comparing `p_1` with itself and another index `i` (from 1 to `n-1`). This seems redundant since `p_i \mid p_i` will always be `p_i`.
   - It prints a query `? v1 v1 v2 v2` and waits for the result.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `v1` to `v2`. This logic doesn't seem to serve a clear purpose in the context of finding the maximum XOR.

3. **Second Phase of Queries**:
   - The program then iterates from `1` to `n-1` again.
   - It prints a query `? v1 i v1 prev` and waits for the result.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `prev` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it prints another query to confirm the equality and updates `prev` if necessary.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - After the queries, it outputs the indices `prev` and `v1` as the result.

### Issues Identified

1. **Redundant Queries**:
   - The initial query `? v1 v1 v2 v2` is redundant and does not provide useful information for finding the maximum XOR.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic for updating `v1` and `prev` is not aligned with the goal of finding the maximum XOR. The program does not ensure that the indices selected maximize the XOR value.

3. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes more than 3n queries in some cases, which violates the constraint of making at most 3n queries.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the maximum XOR pair within the allowed query limit. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness

**False**
