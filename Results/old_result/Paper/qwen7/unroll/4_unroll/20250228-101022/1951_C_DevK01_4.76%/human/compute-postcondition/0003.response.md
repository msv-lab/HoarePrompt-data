Output State: The final value of `t` will be the same as the initial value of `t`. For each iteration of the loop, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` will be updated based on the input lists `L` and `M`. The variable `cost` will be calculated differently depending on the values of `n` and `m`, and printed at the end of each iteration. After all iterations, the final state of `t`, along with all the `cost` values printed during each iteration, will be the output state.
