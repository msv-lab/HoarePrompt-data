The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and prints the cost. The function updates the values of \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) based on the input, sorts the list \( M \), and computes the cost using specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final value of \( t \) and the costs calculated for each test case.
