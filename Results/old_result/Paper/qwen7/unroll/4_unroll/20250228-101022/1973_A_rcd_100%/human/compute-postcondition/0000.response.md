Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property. The other conditions and constraints on `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged and are still valid, but they are not directly affected by the given code snippet.
