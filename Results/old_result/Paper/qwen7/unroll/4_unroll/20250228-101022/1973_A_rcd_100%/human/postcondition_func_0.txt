The function processes up to 500 test cases, each consisting of three integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) where \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). If the sum is even, it calculates and prints one of the following values: \( p_1 + p_2 \), \( p_1 - x + p_3 \), or \( p_3 \), where \( x \) and \( y \) are determined by a specific algorithm involving a while loop. After processing all test cases, the function ends with no return value.
