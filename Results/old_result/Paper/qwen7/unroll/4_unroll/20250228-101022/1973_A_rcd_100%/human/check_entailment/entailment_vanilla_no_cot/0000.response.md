Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of Draw Conditions**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current approach does not correctly account for all possible scenarios where draws can happen.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when the sum of the scores is odd, which should directly return `-1`.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Calculating Draws**: The logic inside the `while` loop is not designed to find the maximum number of draws. It attempts to adjust `x` and `y` values but does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if the total score is even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games played
        min_games = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Initialize variables to store the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = -1
        
        # Iterate over possible number of games
        for games in range(min_games + 1):
            # Calculate the remaining points after accounting for wins
            remaining_points = p1 + p2 + p3 - games * 2
            
            # Check if the remaining points can be distributed as draws
            if remaining_points % 2 == 0:
                draws = remaining_points // 2
                # Ensure the distribution is valid
                if draws <= min(games, p3 - p1) and draws <= min(games, p3 - p2):
                    max_draws = max(max_draws, draws)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This solution correctly handles the conditions for the total score being even, calculates the minimum number of games needed, and then iterates through possible numbers of games to find the maximum number of draws that can be made while satisfying the constraints.
