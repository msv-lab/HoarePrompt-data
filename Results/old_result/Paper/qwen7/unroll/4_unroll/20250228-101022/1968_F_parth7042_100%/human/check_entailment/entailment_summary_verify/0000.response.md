### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness according to the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Reading and Processing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into tokens.
   - It processes each test case individually, extracting `n`, `q`, and the array `a`.
   - It calculates the prefix XOR values and stores them in `pf`.
   - It uses a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.

2. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, the subarray is considered interesting, and the result is 'YES'.
   - If the XOR is not zero, the program checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray using binary search (`bisect_left`).

3. **Binary Search Check:**
   - The binary search is used to find the smallest index `i` in the subarray such that the XOR of the subarray `a[l:i]` is equal to the XOR of the subarray `a[i:r+1]`.
   - This check ensures that the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR values.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. The program handles all the necessary cases and examples provided in the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the provided code that would cause it to fail for any input within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description.
