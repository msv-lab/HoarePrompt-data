### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the original assessment.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers \( n \).

2. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the total water is divisible by \( n \).
   - If not, it returns 'No'.
   - If the total water is divisible by \( n \), it calculates the target amount of water per container.
   - It then checks if redistributing the water according to this target would result in any container having less than zero water.
   - If any container ends up with less than zero water, it returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and splits it into `n` and the list `a`.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1`:
     - Calculates the total water and checks if it is divisible by \( n \).
     - If not, it returns 'No'.
     - If divisible, it calculates the target amount of water per container.
     - It then iterates through each container and checks if the accumulated difference between the current water and the target water is negative.
     - If any difference is negative, it returns 'No'.
     - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function correctly checks if the total water is divisible by \( n \).
   - If the total water is not divisible by \( n \), it correctly returns 'No'.
   - If the total water is divisible by \( n \), it calculates the target amount of water per container.
   - It then checks if redistributing the water according to this target would result in any container having less than zero water.
   - This check ensures that the redistribution process does not violate the condition that no container can have less than zero water.

Given the function summary and the program code, the logic is sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. The function handles all the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the function summary provided.
