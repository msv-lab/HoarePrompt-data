Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into parts, which is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case.
3. **Initial Checks**: The function first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
4. **Target Water Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
5. **Container Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts, adjusting a balance variable (`container`). If at any point the balance goes negative, it means it's impossible to equalize the water amounts, so it returns 'No'. If the loop completes without issues, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly identifies whether it's possible to equalize the water amounts across all containers. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
