### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another.
   - The key observation is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`).

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes it in a specific way.
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through the containers and keeps track of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the containers, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the program is sound. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, it is always possible to balance the containers by pouring water from containers with more water to those with less water until they all have the same amount.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` and immediately returns 'No'.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the total amount of water is divisible by `n` and checks if it's possible to balance the containers.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Correctness:
**True**
