Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The key observation is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, then it is always possible to equalize the water in all containers. This is because the average amount of water per container is an integer, and we can always distribute the water to achieve this average.
3. The program correctly calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
4. If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`) and iterates through each container to check if redistributing the water can achieve this target without any container having a negative water amount.
5. The logic in the loop ensures that if at any point the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the target, and thus it returns 'No'.
6. If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the redistribution is possible, and it returns 'Yes'.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and the provided test cases validate its correctness.

Correctness: **True**
