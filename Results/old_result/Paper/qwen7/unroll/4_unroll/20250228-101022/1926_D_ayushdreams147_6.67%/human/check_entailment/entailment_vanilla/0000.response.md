### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to divide a set of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value at any of the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` which takes the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `a`.
   - It initializes a result variable `res` to keep track of the number of groups.
   - A dictionary `count` is used to keep track of the modified version of the numbers (`num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`).
   - For each number in the list, it checks if the modified number is already in the dictionary. If not, it increments the result and adds the modified number to the dictionary. If it is already in the dictionary, it decrements the count for that number.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The expression `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all the bits of the number `num`. This effectively maps all numbers to a unique value based on their 31 least significant bits.
   - The use of XOR with `(1 << 31) - 1` ensures that each number is mapped to a unique value that depends only on its 31 least significant bits.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies that each number should be placed in a group based on its 31 least significant bits.
   - The dictionary `count` ensures that each unique 31-bit pattern is counted only once, thus determining the minimum number of groups required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases like duplicate numbers and numbers with all bits set to zero correctly.
   - The solution works within the constraints provided (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) integers).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
