The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, which is a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). After applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in the list `a`, the function returns the count of unique numbers in the modified list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, applies the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in `a`, and returns the count of unique numbers in the modified list.**
