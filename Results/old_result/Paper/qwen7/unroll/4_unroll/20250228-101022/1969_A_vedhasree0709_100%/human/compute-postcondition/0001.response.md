Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and after executing the loop, if there exists an index i such that the element at index i in the list l is equal to i+1 after swapping elements according to the list l, the output will be 2, otherwise the output will be 3.
