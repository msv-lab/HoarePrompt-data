The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) and a list \(p\) of \(n\) integers. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index \(i\) such that \(p[i] = i + 1\). If such an index is found, it prints 2 and breaks out of the loop. If no such index exists after checking all elements, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
