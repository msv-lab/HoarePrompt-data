Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where no pair of friends can form a valid invitation pair (i.e., where no friend and their best friend both receive invitations).

Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, the program should output `3` because Monocarp needs to send invitations to friends 1, 2, and 3 to ensure that at least two friends come to the party. However, the current implementation will incorrectly output `2`, assuming that sending invitations to friends 1 and 2 would suffice, which is not the case.

The program only checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and outputs `2` if such a pair is found. This logic is insufficient because it does not account for cases where no such pairs exist, requiring more than two invitations to satisfy the condition.
