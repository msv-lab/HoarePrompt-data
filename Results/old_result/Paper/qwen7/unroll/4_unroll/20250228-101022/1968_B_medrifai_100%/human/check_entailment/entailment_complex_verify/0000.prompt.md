You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while j < m and i < n:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are binary strings, i is an integer representing the current index in string a being considered, and j is an integer representing the current index in string b being checked for the subsequence.
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if (index != -1) :
        return j + index
        #The program returns the value of j plus index, where index is the position where a[i] is found in the substring of b starting from j, and both a and b are binary strings.
    else :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the value of `j` plus the index within the substring where `a[i]` is located; otherwise, it returns `-1`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`.

Here's a counterexample:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 5
  100
  11010
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly returns `2` instead of `3`, because it finds the next `0` at index `2` in `b` (which is the third character), but it should find the next `0` at index `4` (which is the fifth character), making the entire prefix `100` a valid subsequence of `b`.

To fix this, the function `func_1` should correctly handle the search for the next occurrence of the current character in the remaining part of `b`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    index = b[j:].find(a[i])
    if index != -1:
        return j + index
    else:
        return -1
```

However, the main issue lies in the logic of the loop where `func_1` is called. The loop should continue until either the end of `a` or `b` is reached, and it should correctly update the indices `i` and `j` based on the result of `func_1`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = str(input())
    b = str(input())
    i = 0
    j = 0
    c = 0
    while i < n and j < m:
        new_j = func_1(a, b, i, j)
        if new_j != -1:
            j = new_j + 1
            i += 1
            c += 1
        else:
            break
    print(c)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly finds the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of `b`.
