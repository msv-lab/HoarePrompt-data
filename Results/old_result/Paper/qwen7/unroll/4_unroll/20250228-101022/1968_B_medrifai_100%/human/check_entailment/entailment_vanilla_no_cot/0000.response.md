Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Main Loop**: For each test case, it initializes indices `i` and `j` to traverse through strings `a` and `b`, respectively. It also initializes a counter `c` to keep track of the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Subsequence Check Function (`func_1`)**: This function checks if the character at position `i` in `a` appears in the remaining part of `b` starting from position `j`. If found, it returns the position in `b` where the character was found relative to `j`. If not found, it returns `-1`.

4. **Prefix Matching Logic**: In the main loop, it uses the result from `func_1` to update the indices `i` and `j` and increment the counter `c`. If no matching character is found, the loop breaks.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `c`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.

The provided implementation correctly follows the problem statement and handles all the given constraints and examples accurately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
