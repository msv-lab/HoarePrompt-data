Output State: **The program returns the count of indices `i` for which the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` (which is the ceiling of `k / 2`) or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b` (which is the floor division of `k` by 2)**.
