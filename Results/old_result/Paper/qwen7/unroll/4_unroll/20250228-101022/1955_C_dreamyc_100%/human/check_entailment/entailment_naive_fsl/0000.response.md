Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not accurately reflect the sequence of attacks. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship, but the current implementation checks if the cumulative durability of the first `a` and last `b` ships is less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively, which does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
The expected sequence of attacks would be:
1. Attack the first ship: Durabilities become [0, 2, 4, 3]
2. Attack the last ship: Durabilities become [0, 2, 4, 2]
3. Attack the first ship: Durabilities become [0, 1, 4, 2]
4. Attack the last ship: Durabilities become [0, 1, 4, 1]
5. Attack the first ship: Durabilities become [0, 0, 4, 1]

In this case, all ships sink, but the program incorrectly returns 2.

To fix this, the program needs to simulate the attacks in the correct order, reducing the durability of the ships accordingly and updating the positions of the first and last ships as they sink.
