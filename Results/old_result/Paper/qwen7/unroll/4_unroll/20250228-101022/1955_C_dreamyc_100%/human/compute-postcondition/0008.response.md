Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` is the floor division of `k` by 2, `ans` is the count of indices `i` for which the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`.
