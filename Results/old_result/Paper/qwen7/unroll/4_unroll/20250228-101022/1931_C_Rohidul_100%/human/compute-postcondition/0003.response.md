Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). It also ensures that the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The function returns the result based on the given test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a count of test cases (t), the number of elements in an array (n), and an array of positive integers (a). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified conditions and constraints.
