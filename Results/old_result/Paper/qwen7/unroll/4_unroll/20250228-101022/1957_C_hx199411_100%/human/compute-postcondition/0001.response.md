The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
