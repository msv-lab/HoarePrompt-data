Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`. It is either 1 or half the length of `s`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is True, meaning that the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the entire string `s`.
- `x` is not equal to -1.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is True, meaning that the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the substring starting from index `x + 1`.

Given this information, the `print('NO')` statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
