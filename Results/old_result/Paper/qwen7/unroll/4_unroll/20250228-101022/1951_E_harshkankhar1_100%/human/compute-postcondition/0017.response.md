Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character of `s`.
- `func_1(s[0:])` is `True`, meaning the function `func_1` returns `True` when applied to the entire string `s`.
- `x` is not equal to `-1`, indicating that there is at least one character in `s` that differs from the first character.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` evaluates to `False`, meaning the function `func_1` returns `False` when applied to the substring starting from index `x + 1`.

The print statement is simply `print(2)`, which will directly print the integer `2`.

Output: **2**
