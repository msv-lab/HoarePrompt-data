### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), otherwise `False`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
     - Otherwise, it iterates through the string to find the first character that differs from the first character.
     - If no such character is found, it means the string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
     - If a differing character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the second part is a palindrome.
       - If the second part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.
       - If the second part is a palindrome and the split is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO".
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition.

### Analysis:

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The function correctly identifies if the entire string is a palindrome.
  - When the entire string is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
  - When the entire string is a palindrome, it correctly outputs "NO".
  - However, there are issues with how the function handles the split at the beginning or middle of the string:
    - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is problematic because it only considers splits at the very beginning or exactly at the middle of the string. This does not cover all possible valid splits.
    - For example, consider the string "aabbaa". The function would incorrectly output "NO" because `x` is not 1 or `n // 2`, even though the string can be split into "aab" and "baa" which are both non-palindromic.

- **General Logic**:
  - The logic for finding the first differing character and splitting the string is generally sound.
  - However, the handling of the split position needs to be more robust to cover all valid partitions.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_2` has a flaw in its logic for handling the split position, which can lead to incorrect results in some cases. Specifically, the condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is too restrictive and does not account for all valid partitions.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
