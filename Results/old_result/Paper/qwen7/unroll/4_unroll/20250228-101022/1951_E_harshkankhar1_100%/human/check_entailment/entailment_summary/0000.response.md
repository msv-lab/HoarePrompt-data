Reasoning:
- The problem requires checking if a string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of these substrings are palindromes.
- `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome.
- `func_2` attempts to solve the problem by:
  1. Checking if the entire string is a palindrome using `func_1`.
  2. If the entire string is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition.
  3. If the entire string is a palindrome, it tries to find a point where the string can be split into two parts such that neither part is a palindrome.
  4. If such a split is found, it prints "YES" and the two resulting parts.
  5. If no valid split is found, it prints "NO".

Let's analyze the logic:
- If the entire string is not a palindrome, splitting it into one part (the whole string) satisfies the condition.
- If the entire string is a palindrome, `func_2` tries to find a split point:
  - If the first character is different from the last character, it splits at the first occurrence of a different character.
  - If the string is symmetric around the middle (e.g., "lllllll"), it checks if the split at the middle or near the middle results in non-palindromic parts.
  - If no valid split is found, it concludes that no such partition exists.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_2`, the function correctly handles all cases described in the examples and problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
