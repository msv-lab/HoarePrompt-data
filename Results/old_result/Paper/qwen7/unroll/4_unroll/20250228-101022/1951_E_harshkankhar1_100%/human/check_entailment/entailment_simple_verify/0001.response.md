### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to partition the string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **Initial Check**: It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single partition. This part is correct.
   - **Finding the First Differing Character**: It then iterates through the string to find the first character that differs from the first character. If no such character is found, it means the string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO". This part is correct.
   - **Splitting the String**: If a differing character is found, it splits the string at that point and checks if the second part is a palindrome.
     - **Second Part Not Palindrome**: If the second part is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition. This part is correct.
     - **Second Part Is Palindrome**: If the second part is a palindrome, it further checks the position of the split:
       - **Split at Beginning or Middle**: If the split is at the beginning or middle of the string, it prints "NO". This part is incorrect because the function should still consider the possibility of a valid partition even if the second part is a palindrome but the split is not at the beginning or middle.
       - **General Case**: Otherwise, it prints "YES" with the two-part partition. This part is correct.

### Analysis:

- The function correctly identifies if the entire string is a palindrome.
- When the entire string is not a palindrome, it correctly outputs "YES" and the string itself as a single partition.
- When the entire string is a palindrome, it correctly outputs "NO".
- When the string can be split into two non-palindromic parts, it correctly outputs "YES" and the appropriate partitions.
- However, the function incorrectly handles the case where the split is not at the beginning or middle of the string. It should still output "YES" if the second part is not a palindrome, regardless of the position of the split.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_2` correctly implements the required logic to determine if a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings in most cases, but it fails to handle the case where the split is not at the beginning or middle of the string correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
