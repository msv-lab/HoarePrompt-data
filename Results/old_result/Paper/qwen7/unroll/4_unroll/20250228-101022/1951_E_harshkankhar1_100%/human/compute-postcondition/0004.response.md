Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is `-1`.
- The function `func_1` applied to the entire string `s` returns `False`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(1)
```

This code simply prints the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1(s)`.

Output: **1**
