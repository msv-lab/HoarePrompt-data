Postcondition: **s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and if x is either 1 or half the length of s, the function continues to check that func_1(s[0:]) is True and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is neither 1 nor half the length of s, the function also ensures that func_1(s[0:]) is True and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True.**
