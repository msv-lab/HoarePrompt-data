Output State: **s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s**.

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads a string from the user input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The length of the string `s` is stored in the variable `n`. The initial conditions about `s` being a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters and the length `n` being between 1 and \(10^6\) remain valid.
