You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a sequence of n binary values. It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the sequence and then counts the number of zeros remaining in the sequence. For each test case, it outputs the modified sequence followed by the count of zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the cells with chips (1) and free cells (0).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The code removes leading free cells (`a[0] == 0`) using `while a and a[0] == 0: a.pop(0)` and trailing free cells (`a[-1] == 0`) using `while a and a[-1] == 0: a.pop()`. This part is correct as it ensures that the list `a` only contains cells with chips.

3. **Counting the Minimum Operations:**
   - The intention is to count the number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
   - However, the current logic simply counts the number of free cells in the list `a`, which is not correct. The number of operations required should be the maximum index of a chip in the list plus one, minus the length of the list `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the list `a` after removing free cells, but this is unnecessary for determining the number of operations.
   - The function prints the result `res`, which is incorrectly calculated.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly calculate the minimum number of operations, we need to find the maximum index of a chip and subtract the length of the list `a` from this index plus one.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        max_index = -1
        
        # Find the maximum index of a chip
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 1:
                max_index = i
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations
        if max_index != -1:
            res = max_index + 1 - len(a)
        
        print(res)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
