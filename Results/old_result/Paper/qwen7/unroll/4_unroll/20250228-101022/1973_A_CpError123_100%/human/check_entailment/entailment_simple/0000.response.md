Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.
3. It checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the given scoring system (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw).
4. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents half of the total points scored, which is necessary to determine the maximum number of draws.
5. It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the combined points of the first two players, which can help in determining the maximum possible number of draws.
6. Finally, it prints the minimum value of `x` and `y`. Since each draw gives 1 point to each player, the maximum number of draws is limited by the smaller of these two values.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to correctly determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

Correctness: **True**
