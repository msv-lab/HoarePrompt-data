Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of draws that could have happened given the scores of three players.
2. The provided solution correctly identifies when the scores are inconsistent by checking if the sum of the scores is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players).
3. For valid cases where the sum is even, the solution calculates the total number of games played as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This is correct because each game contributes 2 points in total.
4. The solution then calculates the minimum value between the total number of games and the sum of the first two players' scores (`a + b`). This is correct because each game can contribute at most 1 point to each of the first two players in the case of a draw.
5. The logic ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated correctly, as each draw gives 1 point to each of the first two players.

Given these points, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
