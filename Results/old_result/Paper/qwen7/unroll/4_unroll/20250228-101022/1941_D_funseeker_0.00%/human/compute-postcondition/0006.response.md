Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers including `n`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.add(n)` adds the value of `n` to the set `ans`. Since `ans` was initially a set of integers resulting from applying the operations defined by `c` within the inner loop for `m` iterations, starting with the initial elements in `ans` excluding 0, the addition of `n` to `ans` updates the set. All other variables and their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `ans` includes the integer `n`.
