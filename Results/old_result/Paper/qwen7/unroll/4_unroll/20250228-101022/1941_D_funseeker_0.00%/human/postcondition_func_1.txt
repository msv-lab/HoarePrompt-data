The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( x \), along with a list of \( m \) tuples containing integers \( r_i \) and characters \( c_i \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_1()` and returns an integer value which is the result of `func_1()` for each test case.
