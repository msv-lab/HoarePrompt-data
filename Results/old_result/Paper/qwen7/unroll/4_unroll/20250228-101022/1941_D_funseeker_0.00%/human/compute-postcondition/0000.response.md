Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`, `n` is now the value returned by `func_3()[0]`, `m` is now the value returned by `func_3()[1]`, and `x` is now the value returned by `func_3()[2]`.**

This means that the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` have been updated to the values returned by the `func_3()` function call, while `ans` remains a set initialized with the player `x`.
