Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers resulting from applying the operations defined by `c` within the inner loop for `m` iterations, starting with the initial elements in `ans` excluding 0. Each element in `ans` is updated based on adding or subtracting `r` modulo `n` depending on the value of `c`.**

Explanation: The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the element `0` from the set `ans`. All other elements and their transformations remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
