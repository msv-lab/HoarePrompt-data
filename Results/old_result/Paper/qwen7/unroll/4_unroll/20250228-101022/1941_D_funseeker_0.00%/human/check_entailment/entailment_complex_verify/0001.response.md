### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to track the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
   - The ball can be thrown either clockwise (`0`) or counterclockwise (`1`), or the direction might be unknown (`?`).
   - We need to consider all possible directions for each throw and update the set of players who could have the ball after each throw.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Converts the result of `func_1` to a list of integers.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
     - Reads `n`, `m`, and `x` from input.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
     - Iterates `m` times, reading each throw.
     - For each throw, updates the set `ans` to include both possible new positions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
     - If the final position is `0`, it is adjusted to `n` (since indices wrap around).
     - Prints the size of the set and its elements.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Initialization:** The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting position `x`.
   - **Loop Logic:** The loop iterates `m` times, reading each throw. For each throw, the set `ans` is updated to include both possible new positions based on the direction `c`. This handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws correctly.
   - **Adjustment for Zero:** If the final position is `0`, it is correctly adjusted to `n` using `ans.discard(0)` and `ans.add(n)`. This ensures that the set wraps around correctly.
   - **Output:** The size of the set and its elements are printed correctly, matching the requirements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the direction is unknown (`?`) by considering both possible directions.
   - The code correctly handles the wrap-around condition when the final position is `0`.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The logic correctly tracks all possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
   - The code reads and processes input as specified.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, considering all possible directions for each throw.

### Correctness:
**True**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
