You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

    #State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least `n` substrings where each substring has exactly `k` distinct characters. If such substrings exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a specific string `ans` constructed based on the bits set in `cur`. The final output is a combination of 'YES'/'NO' and the constructed string `ans` for each input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( m \), and a string \( s \). For each test case, it checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) substrings where each substring has exactly \( k \) distinct characters. If such substrings exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a specific string \( ans \) constructed based on the bits set in the variable \( cur \). The final output is a combination of 'YES'/'NO' and the constructed string \( ans \) for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It initializes `cnt` to count how many possible strings of length `n` can be formed.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to keep track of the characters seen so far in the string `s`.
   - For each character in `s`, it updates the bitmask `cur` if the character has not been seen before.
   - If all `k` bits in the bitmask are set (`cur == (1 << k) - 1`), it increments `cnt` and resets `cur`.

3. **Checking Validity:**
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES" because all possible strings of length `n` can be formed as subsequences.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans`:
     - `ans` is initialized with the last character seen in the bitmask.
     - It adds characters that were not seen in the current bitmask until the length of `ans` reaches `n`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Bitmask Usage:**
   - The bitmask approach correctly tracks which characters have been seen but might not be sufficient to ensure all subsequences are covered.
   - The logic to construct `ans` after determining "NO" is flawed. It does not guarantee that the constructed string is indeed a valid subsequence of `s`.

2. **Constructing the Invalid Subsequence:**
   - The program constructs a string `ans` by adding characters that were not seen in the current bitmask, but this does not necessarily mean such a string exists in `s`.
   - The construction logic might produce a string that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the following test case:
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

- For the first test case, the output is correct: "YES".
- For the second test case, the output should be "NO", but the constructed string `aa` is not necessarily a valid subsequence of `abb`.
- For the third test case, the output should be "NO", but the constructed string `ccc` is not necessarily a valid subsequence of `aabbccabab`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly identify all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed as subsequences of `s`. Additionally, the constructed string `ans` after "NO" is not guaranteed to be a valid subsequence.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
