Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 because `range(t)` generates values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^5\), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to start. The initial value of `i` is automatically set to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
