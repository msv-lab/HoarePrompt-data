Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, and `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^5, and the code does not change this condition, `t` remains a positive integer within this range. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `m`, and `s`) are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their unspecified but valid initial conditions.
