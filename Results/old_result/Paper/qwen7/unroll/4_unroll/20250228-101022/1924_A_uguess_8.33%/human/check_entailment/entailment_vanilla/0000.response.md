### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m`.

2. **Bitmasking Approach:**
   - The program uses bitmasking to keep track of the characters seen so far.
   - `cur` is a bitmask representing the set of characters seen in the current substring of `s`.
   - `cnt` keeps track of how many unique sets of `k` characters have been seen in `s`.

3. **Processing the String:**
   - For each character in `s`, the program updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen, and `cnt` is incremented.
   - `cur` is reset to 0 after each full set of `k` characters is seen.

4. **Checking Completeness:**
   - After processing the entire string, the program checks if `cnt` is at least `n`.
   - If `cnt` is at least `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string that is missing from `s`.

5. **Constructing the Missing String:**
   - The program identifies the missing character by checking which bit in `cur` is not set.
   - It constructs a string `ans` that includes the missing character and fills the rest with 'a'.

### Analysis:

- **Bitmasking Logic:** The bitmasking logic correctly tracks the presence of characters in the string `s`. This ensures that all combinations of `k` characters are checked.
- **Counting Unique Sets:** The variable `cnt` accurately counts the number of unique sets of `k` characters seen in `s`.
- **Constructing the Missing String:** The logic to construct the missing string is sound, ensuring that the constructed string is the lexicographically smallest one that is missing from `s`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct based on the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
