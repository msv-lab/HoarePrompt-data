Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each iteration, if the count of the favorite value being removed matches the total count of the favorite value in the sorted list, it prints 'YES'. If the favorite value is never removed, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.
