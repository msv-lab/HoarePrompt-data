Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each input set, if the number of times the favorite value appears in the top k elements of the sorted list is equal to the total number of times it appears in the list, it prints 'YES'. If the favorite value does not appear in the top k elements at all, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.
