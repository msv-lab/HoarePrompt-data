Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `input()` and converts it to an integer with `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Inside `func_1`, a list `a` is created containing integers from `1` to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is read from input.
   - The list `a` is then modified such that every other element starting from index `0` (even indices) is reversed.
   - Finally, the modified list `a` is printed using `print(*a)`.

3. **Permutation Generation:**
   - The permutation generated by the function is `a = [1, 2, ..., n]` where even-indexed elements are reversed.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the list becomes `[4, 2, 3, 1]`.

4. **Checking Validity:**
   - We need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition: there should not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
   - Consider the permutation `[4, 2, 3, 1]`:
     - For `i = 0` and `j = 2`, `p_0 = 4` divides `p_2 = 3` (not true).
     - For `i = 0` and `j = 3`, `p_0 = 4` divides `p_3 = 1` (true, but `p_1 = 2` does not divide `p_4 = undefined`).
     - For `i = 1` and `j = 2`, `p_1 = 2` does not divide `p_2 = 3` (true).
     - For `i = 1` and `j = 3`, `p_1 = 2` does not divide `p_3 = 1` (true).
     - For `i = 2` and `j = 3`, `p_2 = 3` does not divide `p_3 = 1` (true).

5. **General Case:**
   - For any `n`, the permutation generated by reversing every other element ensures that no two consecutive pairs `(p_i, p_{i+1})` will have both `p_i` dividing `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` dividing `p_{j+1}` because the division pattern is disrupted by the reversal.

### Conclusion:
The program generates a valid permutation for each test case according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
