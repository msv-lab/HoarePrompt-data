Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer obtained from input, each iteration of the outer loop processes values of b and c obtained from input, strings d and e obtained from input, and an integer k initialized to 0. After all iterations of the outer loop, k contains the value printed for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the inner loop.
