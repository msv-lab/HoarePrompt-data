Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the sorted unique stone counts. If there is a gap greater than 1 between any two consecutive piles, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The function prints "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case.**
