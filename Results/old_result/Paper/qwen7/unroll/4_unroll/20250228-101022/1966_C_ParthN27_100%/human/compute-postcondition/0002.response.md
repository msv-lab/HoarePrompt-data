Output State: Alice or Bob will be printed based on the input values for each test case. For each test case, if there exists an index `i` (1 < i < n-1) where `s[i] - s[i-1] > 1`, the loop breaks and "Alice" is printed. Otherwise, if `ans` is 1, "Alice" is printed; otherwise, "Bob" is printed. The specific output depends on the input values for each test case.
