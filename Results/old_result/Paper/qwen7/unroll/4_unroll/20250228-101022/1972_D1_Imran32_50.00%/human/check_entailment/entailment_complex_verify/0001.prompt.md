You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\sqrt{n}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \), and prints the final value of \( ans \). The function does not return any value but prints the calculated result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function takes two arguments `n` and `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` with `n`.
   - It calculates `root` as the square root of `n` plus one.
   - It iterates from `2` to `root` and for each `i`, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i`.
   - It adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called with `n` and `k`, but the problem requires `n` and `m`. This means `k` is being used where `m` should be used.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the square root of `n`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Ensure the function call passes the correct parameters.
2. Implement the correct logic to count the valid pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Iterates over each test case and reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), it checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic and has a mismatch in the function call parameters. The corrected program above addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
