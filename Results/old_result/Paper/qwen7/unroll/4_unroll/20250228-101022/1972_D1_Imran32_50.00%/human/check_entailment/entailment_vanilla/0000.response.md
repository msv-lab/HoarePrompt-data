Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates over each test case and calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function takes two arguments `n` and `k` (which should be `m` based on the problem statement).
   - It initializes `ans` with `n`.
   - It calculates `root` as the square root of `n` plus one.
   - It iterates from `2` to `root` and for each `i`, it calculates `cnt` as `i * i`.
   - It adds `(n + i) // cnt` to `ans`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called with `n` and `k`, but the problem requires `n` and `m`. This means `k` is being used where `m` should be used.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the square root of `n`.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, we need to:
1. Ensure the function call passes the correct parameters.
2. Implement the correct logic to count the valid pairs.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

"""

*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Iterates over each test case and reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), it checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic and has a mismatch in the function call parameters. The corrected program above addresses these issues and should work correctly according to the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
