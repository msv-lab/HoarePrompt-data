### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called with `n` and `k`, but the problem requires `n` and `m`. This means `k` is being used where `m` should be used.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the square root of `n`.

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect and provided a corrected version of the program. However, the original assessment did not fully validate the correctness of the corrected program. Let's re-evaluate the corrected program to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

"""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Analysis of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Iterates over each test case and reads `n` and `m`.

2. **Counting Valid Pairs**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), it checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `ans`.

### Validation:
- The corrected program iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and checks the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.

Given the corrected program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues but did not fully validate the corrected solution.

### Final Evaluation:
Since the corrected program accurately implements the required logic and addresses the identified issues, the original assessment was accurate.

**Final: True**
