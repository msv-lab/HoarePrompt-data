Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` has hardcoded conditions that do not account for all possible inputs. For instance, the condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3:` is hardcoded and will only work for this specific case. This hardcoded check is not general enough to cover all possible values of `removals` and `negatives`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
6 6 1
3 7 3 3 32 15
```
- Expected Output: `-9`
- Actual Output: `0` (due to the hardcoded condition)

The solution should dynamically calculate the optimal strategy based on the values of `removals` and `negatives`, rather than relying on hardcoded conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
