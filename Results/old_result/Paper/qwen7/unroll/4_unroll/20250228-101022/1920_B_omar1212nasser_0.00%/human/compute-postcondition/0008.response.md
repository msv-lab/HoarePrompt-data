Output State: `removals`: 0, `negatives`: 0, `elements`: [], `pos`: [s - 2 * 0], `s`: 0, `n`: 0.

Explanation: The loop runs from 1 to `removals` (inclusive). However, since `removals` is initially 0, the loop will not execute any iterations. Therefore, no elements are removed from `elements`, no changes are made to `s` or `n`, and `pos` remains with the single element `s - 2 * n`. Given that `s` and `n` are both initialized to 0, `pos` will contain just `0 - 2 * 0`, which is `0`.
