Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes variables `t`, `r`, `ax`, and `bx`. `t` is the number of test cases, `r` will store the results, `ax` is initialized to a large value, and `bx` is initialized to -1.

2. **Reading Constraints**: For each test case, the program reads `n` constraints and processes them. It correctly updates `ax` and `bx` based on the constraints:
   - For `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `x`.
   - For `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `x`.
   - For `a == 3`, `x` is added to a set `cx`.

3. **Validation and Calculation**: After processing all constraints for a test case, the program checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it appends `0` to `r` because there are no valid values for `k`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total range size `(ax - bx + 1)`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the results for all test cases.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly handle all scenarios as described. The logic ensures that only valid ranges and exclusions are considered, and the final result is calculated accurately.

Correctness: **True**
