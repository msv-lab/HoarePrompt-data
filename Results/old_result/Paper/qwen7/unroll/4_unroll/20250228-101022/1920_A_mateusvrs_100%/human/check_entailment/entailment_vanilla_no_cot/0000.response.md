Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (10^9 + 7) and `bx` to -1 to keep track of the upper and lower bounds of valid `k` values.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
3. **Updating Bounds and Exclusions**:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx`, ensuring `k` is at least this value.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax`, ensuring `k` is at most this value.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to the set `cx` to exclude these values from being valid `k`.
4. **Checking Validity**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there are no valid `k` values, so it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of excluded values (`tmp`) from the total range (`ax - bx + 1`).
5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Given the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement, the program handles all edge cases correctly and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.
