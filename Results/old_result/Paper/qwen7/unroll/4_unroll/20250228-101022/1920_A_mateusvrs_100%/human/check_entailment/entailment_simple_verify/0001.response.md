### Reasoning:

Let's break down the solution step-by-step to verify its correctness using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store results for each test case.
   - `cx` is a set to store values of `x` where `k` must not be equal to `x`.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (10^9 + 7) to ensure any valid lower bound will update it.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to ensure any valid upper bound will update it.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of constraints.
   - We iterate over each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, we update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`. This ensures `k` is at least `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, we update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. This ensures `k` is at most `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, we add `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures `k` cannot be `x`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, we check if `bx > ax`. If so, it means there is no feasible `k`, and we append `0` to `r`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - `ax - bx + 1` gives the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.
     - We subtract the count of elements in `cx` that lie within this range from `ax - bx + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, we print the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Initialization**:
  - The initialization of `ax` to a large value and `bx` to -1 ensures that any valid bounds will update them correctly.
  - Using a set `cx` to store values where `k` must not be equal to `x` ensures uniqueness.

- **Processing Each Constraint**:
  - Updating `bx` and `ax` correctly handles the constraints of type 1 and 2.
  - Adding values to `cx` ensures that `k` cannot be these specific values.

- **Feasibility Check**:
  - The check `if bx > ax:` correctly identifies when there is no feasible `k`.
  - The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the invalid values in `cx` from the total range.

- **Output**:
  - The output is formatted correctly, printing the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the provided solution correctly handles all aspects of the problem. The logic is sound, and the implementation accurately calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
