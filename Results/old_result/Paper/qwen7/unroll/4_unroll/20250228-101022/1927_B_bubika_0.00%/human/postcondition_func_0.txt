The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it constructs a string `s` by mapping each integer in the list `a` to a corresponding lowercase letter from the alphabet `a`, and then increments the count of that letter in another list `b`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the constructed string `s` for each case.
