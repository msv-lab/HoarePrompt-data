Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the trace `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n for all i; the string `a` is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `b` is a list of 26 zeros.

Explanation: The loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `s` of `n` integers. It then constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to its corresponding character in the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` and appending these characters to `r`. After processing all integers in `s`, it increments the count of the corresponding character in the list `b`. The final value of `r` is printed but does not affect the state of `a` or `b`. Therefore, the state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged after all iterations of the loop.
