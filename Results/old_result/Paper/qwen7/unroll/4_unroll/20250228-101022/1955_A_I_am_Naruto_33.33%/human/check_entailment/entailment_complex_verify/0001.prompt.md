You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of minimum values printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( n > 1 \), the output is the minimum value between \( a \times n \) and \( b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \). If \( n = 1 \), the output is simply \( a \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases, each consisting of three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times n \) or \( b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \), depending on whether \( n \) is greater than 1. It then prints the minimum of these two values. If \( n = 1 \), it simply prints \( a \). After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
3. **Single Yogurt Purchase Check**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `a`, which is the correct price for one yogurt.
4. **Promotion Calculation**: If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible total costs:
   - `ans1`: The cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price (`a * n`).
   - `ans2`: The cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price (`b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
5. **Minimum Cost Selection**: The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated values, which is the correct approach to minimize the total cost.

Given the logic and the calculations performed, the program correctly implements the required functionality.

**Conclusion:**
- The program handles all edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1).
- It correctly calculates the minimum cost using both the regular price and the promotion price.
- The logic for choosing between the two pricing methods is sound.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
