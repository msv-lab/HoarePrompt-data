Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is between 1 and 20. It then checks if the string `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` contains such a character, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `c` is entirely composed of characters found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for each of the `t` test cases provided, where `t` is between 1 and 1000. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
