Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
```
6 3 2
1 3 5
```
In this case, the program should be able to add up to 2 additional vertices. However, the current implementation does not account for all possible ways to maximize the number of triangles. The program checks for consecutive vertices and gaps but does not fully explore all possibilities for forming triangles.

A correct approach would involve a more comprehensive strategy to ensure that the maximum number of triangles is formed, considering all possible vertex combinations within the constraints. The current implementation may miss optimal solutions in certain scenarios, leading to an incorrect result.
