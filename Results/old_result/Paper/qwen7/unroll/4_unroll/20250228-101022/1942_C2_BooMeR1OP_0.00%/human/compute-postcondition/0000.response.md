Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an input integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y is an input integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values are assigned to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
