Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), `y` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`, `present` is a set containing all elements from the list `a` minus one, `ans` is x - 2**.

This means that the value of `ans` has been updated to `x - 2`, while all other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
