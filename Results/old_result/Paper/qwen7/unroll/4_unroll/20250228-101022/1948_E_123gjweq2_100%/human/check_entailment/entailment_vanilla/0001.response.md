Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters `n` and `k`.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.

2. **Loop to Assign Values**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
   - For each iteration `i`, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function fills the array in a specific pattern, ensuring that elements within the same segment (determined by `left` and `right`) are assigned different values but within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on `left` and `right`.
   - It splits the range into two parts (`mid` and `not_mid`) and fills the array accordingly.
   - Elements in the first half are filled with smaller values starting from `small_element`, and elements in the second half are filled with larger values starting from `big_element`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that:
1. The values in `arr` are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
2. The conditions for forming cliques are met: for every pair of vertices `(i, j)`, `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
3. The partition into cliques is minimal.

#### Example Verification

Let's take the example from the problem statement:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 4`:
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - The expected output is:
    ```
    3 1 5 2 4
    2
    1 1 2 1 2
    ```

- Let's manually check the conditions:
  - Vertices 1 and 2: `|1-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 3: `|1-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 4: `|1-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 5: `|1-5| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 > 4` (invalid, but they are in different cliques)
  - And so on...

- The partition ensures that vertices within the same clique satisfy the condition, and vertices in different cliques do not.

### Conclusion

The program correctly assigns values to the vertices and partitions them into the minimum possible number of cliques based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
