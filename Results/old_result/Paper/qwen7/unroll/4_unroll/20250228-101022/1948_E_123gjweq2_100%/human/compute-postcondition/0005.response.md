Output State: `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`, `arr` is a list where for each index `i` from `left + mid - 1` to `left + mid - 1 + mid - 1`, `arr[i] = small_element + i - (mid - 1)`, `cliquess` is a list where for each index `i` from `left` to `left + mid - 1`, `cliquess[i] = clique`.
