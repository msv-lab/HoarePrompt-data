Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the provided functions meet the requirements of the problem statement. Let's break down the problem and the provided functions:

### Problem Requirements:
1. **Input**: The program needs to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
2. **Output**: For each test case, the program must output:
   - An array `arr` of length \( n \) containing distinct integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - An integer `q` representing the minimum number of cliques needed to partition the graph.
   - An array `cliquess` of length \( n \) indicating which clique each vertex belongs to.

### Provided Functions:
1. **`func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes an array `arr` with `n` ones and an array `cliquess` with `n` zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` to populate these arrays.
   - It prints the arrays and the number of cliques.

2. **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
   - This function fills a segment of the array `arr` and `cliquess` with values.
   - It fills the first half of the segment with increasing values and the second half with decreasing values.
   - It ensures that the values in `arr` are distinct and cover the range from `left + 1` to `right + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **`func_1` Function**:
   - The calculation of the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)` is correct.
   - The initialization of `arr` and `cliquess` is done correctly.
   - The call to `make_array` is correct and ensures that the values in `arr` are distinct and cover the required range.

2. **`make_array` Function**:
   - The logic to fill the segment of `arr` and `cliquess` is correct. It ensures that the values are distinct and cover the required range.
   - The assignment of the same `clique` value to the corresponding segment in `cliquess` is correct.

### Verification:
- The provided functions ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
- The values in `arr` are distinct and cover the range from 1 to \( n \).
- The `cliquess` array correctly indicates the clique membership for each vertex.

Given that the provided functions meet the requirements of the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
