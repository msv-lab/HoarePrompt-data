Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, and m, and binary strings a and b. For each test case, t represents the number of cases, n and m represent the lengths of binary strings a and b respectively, and the function returns results based on these inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific integers and binary strings, without needing to be explicitly called with parameters within its definition. It handles up to 10,000 test cases, with each case involving two binary strings of specified lengths.
