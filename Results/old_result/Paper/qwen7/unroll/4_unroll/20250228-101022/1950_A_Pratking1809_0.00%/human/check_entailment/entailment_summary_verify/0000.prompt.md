You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if true; if \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, followed by the values for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' lines corresponding to the conditions met in each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` is equal to either `a` or `c`. According to the problem description, for the digits to form a stair, `a < b < c`, and for them to form a peak, `a < b > c`. However, the program does not check for equality conditions, which leads to incorrect outputs for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input `1 5 3`. Based on the problem description, this should be classified as a "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify it as "NONE" because it does not account for the case where `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`.
