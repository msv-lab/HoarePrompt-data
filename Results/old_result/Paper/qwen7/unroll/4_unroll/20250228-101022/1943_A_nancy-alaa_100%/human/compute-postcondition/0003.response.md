Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, and a, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 20000, n is a positive integer between 1 and 200000, and a is a list of n non-negative integers. The function returns information based on the values of t, n, and the list a.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each defined by a value of `t`, `n`, and a list `a`. It does not take any parameters explicitly but uses these variables to process and return a result based on the given constraints.
