Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the number of test cases.

2. **Determine the Initial State for the Loop**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as follows:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - For each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - Therefore, the loop will run exactly `t` times.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can execute `t` times. The key variable here is `t`, as it determines the number of iterations.

4. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, i.e., \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
