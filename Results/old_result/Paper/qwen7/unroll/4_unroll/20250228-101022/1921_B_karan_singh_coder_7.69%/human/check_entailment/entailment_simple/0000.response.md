Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly processes each test case as specified in the problem statement.
2. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state `s` of the boxes, and the desired state `t`.
3. The function calculates the number of cats in both the initial (`s`) and desired (`t`) states using `s1 = s.count('1')` and `t1 = t.count('1')`.
4. It then iterates through each box to count the number of differing positions between the initial and desired states using `cnt = 0` and `cnt += s[i] != t[i]` for each box.
5. The logic inside the conditional statements correctly handles the cases where the number of cats in the initial and desired states are the same or different:
   - If `s1 == t1`, it prints `cnt` if `cnt` is non-zero, otherwise it prints `0`. This is because if the number of cats is the same, the operations needed are just the direct changes in positions.
   - If `s1 != t1`, it calculates the absolute difference `d = abs(s1 - t1)` and adjusts the count of differing positions accordingly. The formula `(cnt - d) // 2 + d` ensures that the minimum number of operations is calculated correctly, considering both adding and removing cats.
6. The function outputs the result for each test case as required.

Given the above analysis, the provided function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes into the desired state.

Correctness: **True**
