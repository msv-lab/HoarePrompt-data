Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as required. For example, consider the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, a string with exactly one special character should be generated. However, the current implementation generates strings like "AB" which do not have exactly one special character. The pattern "AB" has zero special characters since neither 'A' nor 'B' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement for `n = 1`.
