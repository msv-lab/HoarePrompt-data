Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution checks if `n` is odd or even.
  - If `n` is odd, it directly prints "NO" because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string constructed from alternating characters.
  - If `n` is even, it constructs a pattern using alternating 'A' and 'B' characters and prints "YES" followed by this pattern.
- The pattern construction logic ensures that every character in the pattern is a special character since each character (except the first and last) has exactly one neighbor that is different.
- The pattern length is `n // 2 * 2`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).
- The solution handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

Correctness: **True**
