You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2 == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            pattern = []
            for i in range(n // 2):
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
                pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
            print(''.join(pattern))
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for `t` iterations, for each `n`, if `n` is odd, the output will be 'NO'. If `n` is even, the output will be 'YES' followed by a pattern consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters repeated `n//2` times.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the required number of special characters.

2. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to generate a string with `n` special characters.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - For an even `n`, the program generates a pattern using 'A' and 'B'.
   - It creates a list `pattern` where each pair consists of alternating 'A' and 'B'.
   - The pattern is constructed by appending pairs of 'AB' and 'BA' in an alternating fashion.
   - Finally, it joins the list into a string and prints it.

4. **Special Character Check:**
   - In the generated string, every character except the first and last will be special because each character (except the first and last) will be equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - For example, in the string "ABAB", 'A' and 'B' are special, but 'B' and 'A' are not special in the context of the problem statement.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1: n = 6**
  - The program generates "ABABAB".
  - Special characters: 4 (positions 2, 3, 4, 5).
  - This does not meet the requirement of having exactly 6 special characters.

- **Test Case 2: n = 1**
  - The program prints "NO" because 1 is odd.

- **Test Case 3: n = 2**
  - The program generates "AB".
  - Special characters: 2 (positions 1 and 2).
  - This meets the requirement of having exactly 2 special characters.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters when `n` is even. It instead generates a string with fewer special characters than required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
