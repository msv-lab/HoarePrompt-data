Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to n) and the corresponding value is a list containing all the nodes it is connected to through the edges specified in the `edges` list; `leaves` is a list containing all the nodes which have only one connection.**

Explanation: The code creates a list called `leaves` which contains all the nodes in the `tree` that have exactly one connection (i.e., nodes with a degree of 1). These nodes are considered leaves in a tree structure. The `start` variable remains unchanged.
