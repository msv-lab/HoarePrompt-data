Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the constraints where t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but operates under specific conditions regarding the variables t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. It evaluates these variables according to their given ranges and constraints and returns a value based on these evaluations.
