### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Score Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`) is even. This is necessary because the total score must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points in total (1 point to each in case of a draw). However, the check is not sufficient to ensure the validity of the scores. The original assessment did not fully address this.

3. **Invalid Score Configuration**: If the sum of the scores is odd, the program prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the described scoring system. This part is correct.

4. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`: Total points scored by all three players.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])`: This term ensures that the calculation does not go negative. If `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` is negative, it means the third player has more points than what can be explained by the first two players' scores alone, which is not possible without invalidating the scores.
     - Subtracting this term from the total points gives the minimum points that must have come from draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the maximum number of draws because each draw adds 2 points (1 to each player).

However, the formula provided in the program does not correctly account for all possible scenarios. Specifically, the formula does not ensure that the individual scores are achievable through valid games. For example, consider the test case `1 1 10`. The sum is even, but the scores are not achievable through any combination of games. The program would incorrectly output `2` draws, which is not valid.

To correctly determine the maximum number of draws, we need to ensure that the individual scores can be achieved through valid games. The correct approach involves checking if the scores can be decomposed into valid combinations of wins and draws.

### Correctness:
The original assessment did not fully address the need to validate the individual scores beyond checking the total sum. The provided formula in the program does not correctly handle all edge cases, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly validate the individual scores to ensure they can be achieved through valid games.
