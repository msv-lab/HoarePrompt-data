Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{15}, a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, where a_i represents the durability of the i-th ship. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet is a comment block that includes metadata about the file and its author. It does not contain any executable statements that would modify the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
