Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes four non-negative integers p_1, p_2, p_3, and p_4, where each represents the count of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence, respectively. It returns the total count of elements in the sequence.**

This means the function takes four integers as inputs indirectly through a sequence's composition and returns the total number of elements in that sequence.
