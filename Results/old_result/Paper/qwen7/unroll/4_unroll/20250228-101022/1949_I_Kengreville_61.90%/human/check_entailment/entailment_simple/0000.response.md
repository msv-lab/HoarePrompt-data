Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes necessary data structures.
2. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the graph formed by the tangency relationships between disks.
3. During the DFS, it calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) which represent the relationship between the radii of the disks. Specifically, `coef0[j]` represents the contribution of the radius of the `i`-th disk to the new radius of the `j`-th disk, and `coef1[j]` represents the scaling factor for the radius of the `j`-th disk.
4. After the DFS completes, it checks if there is any node with `coef1` equal to 1 and `c1` (sum of `coef1` values) not equal to 0. If such a node exists, it means it's possible to decrease the sum of radii while maintaining tangency and non-overlapping conditions.
5. The logic and implementation seem consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
