You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function performs a depth-first search starting from the disk indexed by `i`. It marks the current disk as visited and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for any unvisited disks that are tangent to the current disk. After the function concludes, all disks that are reachable from the initial disk `i` will have been marked as visited, and the `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated for those disks that are tangent to the current disk.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to check if we can adjust the radii of the disks so that:
   - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
   - No two disks overlap.
   - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**: The problem can be modeled using a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent. The goal is to find a way to decrease the radii of some disks while keeping the tangency conditions and ensuring no overlap.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each node.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` represent linear combinations of the original radii and the new radii, respectively.
   - If the sum of `coef1` for a connected component is non-zero, it means we can decrease the sum of radii in that component.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For each disk, if it hasn't been visited, we start a DFS from that disk.
   - During DFS, we update the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - After exploring all connected components, if any component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`, it means we can decrease the total radius of that component.

5. **Output**:
   - If any connected component allows a reduction in the sum of radii, we print "YES".
   - Otherwise, we print "NO".

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and processes the input.
   - The `dfs` function correctly updates the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - The main logic checks if any connected component allows a reduction in the sum of radii.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
