Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as described. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the condition that the sum of all radii must strictly decrease. The `dfs` function only checks for tangency between disks and updates coefficients without ensuring the sum of radii decreases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 2
2 0 2
0 2 2
2 2 2
```

In this case, the disks form a square configuration where each disk is tangent to its adjacent disks. The program would attempt to adjust the radii but does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. Since the initial radii are equal and no adjustment can make the sum strictly smaller while maintaining tangency, the program should output "NO" but may incorrectly output "YES" due to the lack of proper validation for the sum condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
