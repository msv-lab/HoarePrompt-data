State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `ok` is `False`, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
- The loop condition `i in range(n)` requires that `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should start at 0 and `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- All other variables (`nodes`, `coef0`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef1`, `ok`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their initial states are provided as they are.

Thus, the required adjustments are setting `i` to 0 and ensuring `n` is greater than 0.
