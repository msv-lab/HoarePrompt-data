Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are as follows: `visited[i]` is set to True. For each `j`, if there exists a disk `j` such that the distance between the `i`-th disk and the `j`-th disk is equal to the sum of their radii and `j` has not been visited, then `coef0[j]` is updated to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j]` is updated to `-coef1[i]`, otherwise `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` remain `None`.**
