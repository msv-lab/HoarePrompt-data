Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error**: The code checks for a specific condition where `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to decide whether to print `2` or `3`. This logic is flawed because it only checks if the best friend of a friend also has the same index, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The solution does not handle cases where no pair of friends can form a mutual invitation scenario. For example, in the third test case (`2 1`), the solution should output `2`, but it incorrectly outputs `3`.

3. **General Approach**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party. The solution needs to identify cycles or mutual pairs that can be invited together.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to find cycles in the friendship graph and ensure that at least one cycle of length 2 or more exists. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Create a dictionary to map each friend to their best friend
        best_friends = {i + 1: p[i] for i in range(n)}
        
        # Check for cycles of length 2 or more
        visited = set()
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i in visited:
                continue
            cycle_length = 0
            current = i
            while current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                current = best_friends[current]
                cycle_length += 1
            
            # If there is a cycle of length 2 or more, we can invite at most 2 friends from this cycle
            if cycle_length >= 2:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            # If no cycle of length 2 or more is found, we need to invite all friends
            print(n)

func()
```

This solution correctly identifies cycles in the friendship graph and ensures that at least 2 friends are invited, handling all edge cases appropriately.
