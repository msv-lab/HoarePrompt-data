Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop iterates n times. For each iteration, it reads an integer x and a list l of x integers. It checks if the element at index l[i]-1 in list l is equal to i+1. If true, it prints 2 and breaks the inner loop. If the condition is false for all elements in the list, it prints 3.

After all iterations, the output state will consist of a series of 2s and 3s printed during the loop's execution, with exactly n lines of output, one for each iteration of the outer loop.
