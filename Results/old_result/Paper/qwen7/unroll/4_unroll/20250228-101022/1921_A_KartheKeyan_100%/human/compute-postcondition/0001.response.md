Output State: **`n` is the input integer minus 1, `s` is updated based on the input `l`, `l` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input and assigns it to `n`. This means `n` is now one less than its previous value, which was decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop. The value of `s` remains unchanged from its previous state, and `l` remains an input integer as it is updated in each iteration based on the input `l`.
