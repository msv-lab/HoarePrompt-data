### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to identify whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle formed by '1's.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes no arguments but reads input from stdin.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.
   - It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - If the first count in `k` is equal to the second count, it prints these counts.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function processes a grid and checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's.
   - If they do, it prints the counts. Otherwise, it does nothing.
   - This summary is misleading because it does not reflect the full logic needed to solve the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the pattern of '1's in the rows.
   - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the count of '1's in each row should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...`, and the central '1's should align in one column.

5. **Function Logic**:
   - The current function only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine the shape.
   - The function does not check the entire grid for the required patterns of a square or a triangle.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not correctly implement the logic to identify the shape based on the given problem description.
   - The function summary is also misleading and does not capture the full logic needed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function provided does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a square or a triangle based on the given problem description.

### Final:
**False**
