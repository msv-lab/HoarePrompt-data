Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and collects the counts of '1's in each row.
3. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal, which is a very specific condition and does not cover all possible cases for both triangles and squares.

Here are some counterexamples:
- For a triangle, consider the following grid:
```
000
011
011
```
This is a valid triangle, but the program will not detect it because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are not equal.

- For a square, consider the following grid:
```
000
000
111
```
This is a valid square, but the program will not detect it because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are not equal.

Since the program does not handle the general cases for both triangles and squares, it is incorrect.
