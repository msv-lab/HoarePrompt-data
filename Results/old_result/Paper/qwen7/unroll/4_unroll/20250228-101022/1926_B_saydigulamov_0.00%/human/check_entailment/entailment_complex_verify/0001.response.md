### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to identify whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle formed by '1's.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes no arguments but reads input from stdin.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.
   - It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - If the first count in `k` is equal to the second count, it prints the counts. Otherwise, it does nothing.

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The function only checks if the first two counts of '1's in the rows are equal, which is insufficient to determine the shape.
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's, which would be `k` (where `k` is the side length of the square).
   - For a triangle, the counts of '1's in the rows should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...`, and the central '1's should align in one column.
   - The function does not check these patterns correctly. It only checks if the first two counts are equal, which can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the pattern of '1's in the rows.
   - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the count of '1's in each row should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...`, and the central '1's should align in one column.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not implement the correct logic to identify the shape.
   - Therefore, the function will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function provided does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a square or a triangle based on the given problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
