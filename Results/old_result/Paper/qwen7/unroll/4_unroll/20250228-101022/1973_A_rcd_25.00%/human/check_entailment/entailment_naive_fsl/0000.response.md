Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results. 

For instance, consider the input `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the scores should be achievable through a combination of wins and draws. However, the program incorrectly prints `2` for this input, which is not the correct maximum number of draws. The correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to achieve the scores `1, 1, 10` under the given rules.

To fix this, the program needs to properly check all constraints and ensure that the scores are consistent before calculating the maximum number of draws.
