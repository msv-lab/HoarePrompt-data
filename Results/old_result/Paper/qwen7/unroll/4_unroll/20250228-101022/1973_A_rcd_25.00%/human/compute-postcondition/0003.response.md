Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers or -1, depending on the input provided to the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even and \(p3\) is less than \(p1 + p2\), the output will be \(p1 + p2\). Otherwise, it will find a value of \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and print \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) is found, it will print \(p3\). Each output corresponds to the respective input triplet \((p1, p2, p3)\) provided in the loop.
