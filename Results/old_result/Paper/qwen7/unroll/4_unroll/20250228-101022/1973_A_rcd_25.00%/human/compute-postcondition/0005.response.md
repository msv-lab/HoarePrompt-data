Functionality: **The function processes a series of input triplets \((p1, p2, p3)\) and a positive integer \(t\). For each triplet, it checks if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even. If the sum is odd or \(p3\) is greater than or equal to \(p1 + p2\), it outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it finds a value \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and prints \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) exists, it prints \(p3\). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each triplet.**
