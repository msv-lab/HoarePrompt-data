You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers or -1, depending on the input provided to the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even and \(p3\) is less than \(p1 + p2\), the output will be \(p1 + p2\). Otherwise, it will find a value of \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and print \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) is found, it will print \(p3\). Each output corresponds to the respective input triplet \((p1, p2, p3)\) provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3, and a positive integer t. It validates that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
