Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Sum Check**: The function correctly checks if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, which is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total from draws).
3. **Condition Check**: The function correctly checks if \(p3 \geq p1 + p2\). If this condition is true, it prints \(p1 + p2\), which is correct because if \(p3\) is at least as large as the sum of \(p1\) and \(p2\), it means all points could have come from draws or one player winning all games.
4. **Binary Search-like Approach**: The function attempts to find a value of `cur` such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\). This approach is aimed at finding the maximum number of draws. However, the logic inside the loop needs to be carefully examined:
   - The function increments `cur` until it finds a valid value where \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\).
   - Once a valid `cur` is found, it prints \(p1 - cur + p3\), which represents the maximum number of draws.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases like when no valid `cur` can be found by printing \(p3\) in the `else` block. This is correct because if no valid `cur` can be found, it means the scores are inconsistent with the rules, and thus the function should print `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or to identify inconsistent scores.

Correctness: **True**
