Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here's why:

1. **Conditions for 'NO'**:
   - The program incorrectly checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row. This is not sufficient to determine whether it's impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - Similarly, checking if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's start and end characters is also insufficient.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The key insight is that if there are at least two distinct colors in the grid, it is always possible to make all squares the same color using the allowed operations. This is because any subrectangle operation can effectively merge adjacent regions of the same color.
   - Conversely, if the grid is initially monochromatic, it remains monochromatic throughout the operations.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The program should simply check if there are more than one distinct colors in the grid. If there are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
