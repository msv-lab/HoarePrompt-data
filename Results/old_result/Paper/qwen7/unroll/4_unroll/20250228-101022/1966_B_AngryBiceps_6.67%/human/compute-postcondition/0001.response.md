Output State: The output state consists of multiple lines, each containing either 'YES' or 'NO'. For each test case, if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's first and last elements, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'. The number of lines equals the number of test cases provided as input.
