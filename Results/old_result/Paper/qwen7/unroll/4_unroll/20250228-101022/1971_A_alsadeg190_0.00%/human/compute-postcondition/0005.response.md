Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), compares them, and prints either `(x, y)` in descending order if `x > y`, or `(y, x)` in ascending order if `x ≤ y`. After processing all test cases, it concludes with no return value.**
