State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer and x is not equal to 0, `subseq_lens` is an empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `x != 0`.
2. Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer and `x` is not equal to 2.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must be different from 0. Since `x` is not equal to 2, it could still be 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `x` is not equal to 0.
