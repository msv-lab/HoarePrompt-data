Output State: `ans` is the minimum value among `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` for all `i` in the range `k`, `c` is a list of length `n` where each element `c[i]` is equal to `min(a[i], b[i])`, and `suff` is a list of length `n+1` where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of `c[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-1`.
