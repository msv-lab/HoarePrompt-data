### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by lists `a` and `b`. This part matches the problem statement.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a new list `c` where each element is the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct according to the problem statement.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of elements from index `i` to `n-1` in `c`. This is done correctly using a reverse loop.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to one of these positions. For each position `i`, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` accordingly. However, there is a subtle issue here.
   - The problem statement specifies that Kirill can only swap with people ahead of him, and the cost includes paying `a_j` for swapping with the person at position `j` and `b_k` for each person `k` between `j` and `i`. The current implementation only considers the suffix sum `suff[i + 1]`, which does not account for the intermediate costs `b_k` for each `k` between `j` and `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the list `c` and the suffix sum array `suff`.
- However, the logic to find the minimum cost involves only considering `a[i] + suff[i + 1]`, which does not account for the intermediate costs `b_k` for each `k` between `j` and `i`. Therefore, the current implementation does not fully capture the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the program does not correctly account for the intermediate costs `b_k` when calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `k` people.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
