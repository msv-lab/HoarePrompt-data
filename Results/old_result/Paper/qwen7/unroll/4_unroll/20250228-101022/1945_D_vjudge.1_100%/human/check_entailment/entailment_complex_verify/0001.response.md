### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by lists `a` and `b`. This part matches the problem statement.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates a new list `c` where each element is the minimum between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This step is correct according to the problem statement.
   - It then computes a suffix sum array `suff` where `suff[i]` is the sum of elements from index `i` to `n-1` in `c`. This is done correctly using a reverse loop.

3. **Minimum Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to infinity and iterates through the first `k` positions to find the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to one of these positions. For each position `i`, it calculates the cost as `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` and updates `ans` accordingly. However, there is a critical flaw in this logic.
   - The cost calculation should consider the cumulative cost of bribing people from the current position to the target position. Specifically, when moving from position `i` to position `j` (where `j < i`), Kirill needs to pay `a[j]` and `b[k]` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`. The current implementation only considers the suffix sum `suff[i + 1]`, which does not account for the intermediate bribes.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
  - The suffix sum `suff[i]` is correctly calculated as the sum of elements from `i` to `n-1` in `c`. This part is correct.

- **Cost Calculation**:
  - The cost calculation `a[i] + suff[i + 1]` is incorrect because it does not account for the intermediate bribes. The correct cost should be the sum of `a[j]` and `b[k]` for all `j` and `k` such that `j < i` and `j < k < i`.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:

To correctly calculate the cost, we need to consider the cumulative cost of bribing people from the current position to the target position. We can achieve this by maintaining a running sum of the bribes as we iterate through the positions.

Here is the corrected logic within the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, a, b):
    c = [min(a[i], b[i]) for i in range(n)]
    suff = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        suff[i] = suff[i + 1] + c[i]

    ans = float('inf')
    total_bribes = 0
    for i in range(k):
        total_bribes += c[i]
        ans = min(ans, a[i] + total_bribes + suff[i + 1])

    print(ans)
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected logic, the original assessment was inaccurate because the cost calculation did not properly account for the intermediate bribes. The corrected code ensures that the minimum cost is accurately calculated.

**Final: False**
