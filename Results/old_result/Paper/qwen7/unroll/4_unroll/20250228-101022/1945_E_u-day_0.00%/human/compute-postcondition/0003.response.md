Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is given as a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer, and it should be the length of the permutation array `arr`.

Given the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (to ensure it is a positive integer and the length of `arr`).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer and the length of `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is a permutation array of length `n` returned by `func_2()`**
