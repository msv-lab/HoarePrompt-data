Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where multiple groups of `k` identical cards exist, and the goal is to minimize the total number of cards by optimally exchanging them. Specifically, the program only checks if the exact number `k` exists as a frequency and prints `k - 1` if it does, but this logic is incomplete.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 3
2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `1`, as we can exchange all three 2's into one card. However, the current implementation will not handle this case correctly because it does not account for the possibility of having multiple groups of `k` identical cards and merging them optimally.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequencies of each number and how they can be merged optimally.
