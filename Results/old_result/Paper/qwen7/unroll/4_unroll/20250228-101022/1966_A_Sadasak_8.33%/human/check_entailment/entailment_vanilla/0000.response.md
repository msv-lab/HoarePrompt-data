### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
   - Each operation allows us to exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards (`n`) and the value of `k`.
   - It then reads the values of the cards into a list (`nums`).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, we cannot perform any operations, so the result is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, we can only perform one operation, resulting in `k-1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the code calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of card numbers.
     - If `k` appears in the frequency table, we can perform operations until we have fewer than `k` cards of that number, leaving `k-1` cards.
     - Otherwise, no operations can be performed, and the result is `n`.

4. **Reviewing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` correctly creates a frequency table for the card numbers.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.
   - This function is used to check if `k` can be achieved as a frequency in the card numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where `k > n` and `k == n` correctly.
   - The logic for checking if `k` can be a frequency in the card numbers is sound.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. There are no logical errors or omissions that would lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**True**
