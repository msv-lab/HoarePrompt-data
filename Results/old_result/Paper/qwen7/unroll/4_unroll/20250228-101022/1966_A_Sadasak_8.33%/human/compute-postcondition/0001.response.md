Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which iterates over each element in the list `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop starts iterating over `arr`, the first value of `num` will be the first element in the list `arr`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `arr`**: The state of `arr` itself does not change within the loop, but its contents are accessed during each iteration.

4. **Determine the state of `frequency_table`**: The loop body (which is omitted) presumably updates the `frequency_table` dictionary. However, since the loop has not started executing yet, the state of `frequency_table` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an empty dictionary.

5. **Determine the state of `k`**: The variable `k` is not involved in the loop head and its state does not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `arr` to ensure it has at least one element.

**State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `frequency_table` is an empty dictionary**.
