Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Frequency Table**: The `func_1` function is designed to limit the frequency of any number to `k`, but this is unnecessary for solving the problem. Instead, we need to count how many times each number appears in the array.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**: The logic for determining the minimum number of cards left is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the frequency of a number is exactly divisible by `k`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the frequency of a number is exactly `k` and needs to be reduced to `k-1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we should:
1. Count the frequency of each number.
2. Determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further using the given operation.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in nums:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards_left = 0
    for freq in frequency_table.values():
        min_cards_left += freq % k
    
    print(min_cards_left)
```

This approach correctly counts the frequency of each number and then calculates the minimum number of cards that remain after performing the allowed operations.
