### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding `max_item_idx`:**
   - The function `func_2` initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p[max_item_idx] | p[i])` with itself.
   - If the result of the comparison is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
   - This process ensures that `max_item_idx` is set to the index with the highest bitwise OR value among the first `n-1` elements.

3. **Finding `pair_idx`:**
   - The function then sets `pair_idx` to `max_item_idx`.
   - It iterates through all indices from 0 to `n-1` and compares `(p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[max_item_idx] | p[i])`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it further checks `(p[pair_idx] | p[pair_idx])` with `(p[i] | p[i])` and updates `pair_idx` to `i` if the latter is `>`.

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` as the solution.

### Analysis:

1. **Finding `max_item_idx`:**
   - The logic to find `max_item_idx` is correct. It ensures that `max_item_idx` is the index with the highest bitwise OR value among the first `n-1` elements.

2. **Finding `pair_idx`:**
   - The logic to find `pair_idx` is flawed. The goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. However, the current implementation only considers the bitwise OR operation and does not directly address the XOR operation.
   - The current implementation might not always find the optimal pair of indices for the XOR operation.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i ⊕ p_j` is maximized. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
