Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**: The current logic checks if the maximum count of any card (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`, otherwise, it prints `n`. This approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the possibility of reducing the number of cards more effectively through multiple operations.

2. **Example Cases Not Covered Properly**: Let's consider the example cases:
   - For the first example case (`5 3` and `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`), the solution incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `1`.
   - For the third example case (`7 2` and `[4, 2, 1, 100, 5, 2, 3]`), the solution also incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `3`.

3. **General Approach**: The correct approach should involve determining the frequency of each card type and then calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further. Specifically, for each card type, if its count is divisible by `k`, it can be reduced to `count % k`. If not, it can be reduced to `count - (count % k)`.

### Correct Solution:
Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        freq = {}
        for card in l:
            if card in freq:
                freq[card] += 1
            else:
                freq[card] = 1
        
        result = 0
        for count in freq.values():
            result += count // k + (1 if count % k != 0 else 0)
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations optimally.
