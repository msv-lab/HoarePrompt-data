Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two strings `x` and `y` are equal.**

Given the constraints that `x` and `y` are strings of equal length consisting of digits from 1 to 9, the function should compare these two strings. If they are identical, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. However, since the parameters `x` and `y` are not actually passed to the function in the provided code snippet, the function as described does not accept any parameters.
