Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes multiple pairs of input strings `a` and `b`. For each pair, it compares corresponding characters. If the characters are the same, they are added to both `kq1` and `kq2`. If they are different, the smaller digit is added to `kq1` and the larger digit to `kq2`, alternating the order of addition between pairs. Finally, it prints the contents of `kq1` and `kq2` for each pair.**
