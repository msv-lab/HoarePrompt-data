Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
2. The provided `func_1` is intended to solve this problem, but its implementation is flawed. According to the output hints, `func_1` always returns 'No', regardless of the input array. This means it does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.
3. The `func_2` function reads input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` always returns 'No', `func_2` will also always return 'No' for every test case, which does not match the expected behavior based on the problem statement.
4. Based on the provided information, `func_1` should check if there exists a way to split the array and reorder it to be non-decreasing. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not do this. Instead, it checks if any substring of the concatenated list matches the sorted version of the original list, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Given these points, the program as described is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
