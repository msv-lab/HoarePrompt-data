Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but uses predefined variables t (an integer between 1 and 1000), n (an integer between 2 and 50), and a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6). It returns a value based on these predefined variables.**

This means the function `func_2` does not take any parameters when called directly. Instead, it relies on three predefined variables: `t`, `n`, and `a`. The variable `t` is an integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `n` is an integer within the range of 2 to 50, and `a` is a list containing `n` integers, each of which is within the range of 1 to 10^6. The function then processes these variables and returns a value based on their values.
