State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variable `t` which is used as the range parameter in `range(t)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`, and `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.
3. The variable `idx` is not directly involved in the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `results` is an empty list, and this state does not affect the loop's execution, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure it is greater than 0.
