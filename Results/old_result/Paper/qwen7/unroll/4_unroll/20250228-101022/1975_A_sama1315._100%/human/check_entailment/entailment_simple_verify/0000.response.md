### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes an array `a` and checks if it can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version of itself.
- It concatenates `a` with itself (`concatenated_a = a + a`) and then checks if any substring of length `len(sorted_a)` in `concatenated_a` matches `sorted_a`.
- If such a substring is found, it returns `'Yes'`, otherwise it returns `'No'`.

This approach is flawed because it only checks if the array can be rearranged to match its sorted version, not if it can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping according to the problem description.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

#### Example Test Case:
- Consider the input: `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
- Expected Output: `No`

The function `func_1` will incorrectly return `'Yes'` because it checks if the array can be split and rearranged to match a sorted version, but it does not check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping according to the problem description.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, the function needs to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the concatenation of the second part followed by the first part results in a non-decreasing sequence.
- This requires a more complex logic that iterates through possible splits and checks the resulting sequences.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
