Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. It simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` method, which changes how input is read from standard input. However, the initial values and conditions of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
