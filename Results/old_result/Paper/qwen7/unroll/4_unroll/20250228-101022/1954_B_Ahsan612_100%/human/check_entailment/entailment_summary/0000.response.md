Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Segments**: The program does not correctly handle the segments of consecutive identical values. It only increments `same` when it encounters the same value and does not properly reset `same` and update `num` when a different value is encountered. This leads to incorrect segment lengths being calculated.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Instead, it finds the minimum length of consecutive segments of identical values, which is not equivalent to the solution required.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as arrays with only one element or arrays where removing any element would not break the beauty condition.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
