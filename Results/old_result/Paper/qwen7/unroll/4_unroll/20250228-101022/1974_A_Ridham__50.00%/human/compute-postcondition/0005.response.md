Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `n`.

The `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` statement will join all the elements of the `result` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since the exact values of the elements in the `result` list are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of the conditions they were calculated under.

Given this, the output will be a string where each line represents an element from the `result` list, converted to a string and separated by newlines.

Output: **a string with each line representing an element from the `result` list, converted to a string and separated by newlines**
