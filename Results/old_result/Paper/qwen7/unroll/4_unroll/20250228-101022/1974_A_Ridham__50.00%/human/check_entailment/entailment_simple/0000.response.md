### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the values of `x` and `y` for each test case, which represents the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x = x * 1` calculates the total space required for 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4` calculates the total space required for 2x2 icons (each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells).

3. **Total Space Calculation:**
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x` calculates the total space required for all icons.

4. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` if `y` is even, otherwise `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`. This calculation is correct because each 2x2 icon requires 2 full screens (4 cells per screen).

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.

6. **Checking Remaining Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means there is enough space to fit all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons.

7. **Final Screen Count Calculation:**
   - The final screen count is the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and any additional screens required for 1x1 icons.

8. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case correctly.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is correct. The program handles the constraints and requirements accurately, and the calculations are performed as expected.

### Correctness:

**True**
