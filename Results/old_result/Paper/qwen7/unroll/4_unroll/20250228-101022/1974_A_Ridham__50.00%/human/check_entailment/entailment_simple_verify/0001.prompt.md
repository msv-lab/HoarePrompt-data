You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`.

2. **Calculating Space Requirements**:
   - It calculates the total space required for `x` 1x1 icons (`space_x = x * 1`).
   - It calculates the total space required for `y` 2x2 icons (`space_y = y * 4`).

3. **Calculating Required Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - If `y` is even, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2`.
   - If `y` is odd, the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Calculating Remaining Cells**:
   - It calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons (`remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`).

5. **Checking if Remaining Cells Can Fit 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), it adds the number of screens required for 2x2 icons to the result.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`).

6. **Outputting Results**:
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Space Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `space_x` and `space_y` seems correct.
   - However, the logic for calculating `remaining_cells` might be incorrect. The formula `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` does not account for the actual layout constraints of the grid.

2. **Remaining Cells Logic**:
   - The logic for determining `remaining_cells` should consider that each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - The current logic does not correctly handle the placement of 1x1 icons within the remaining cells.

3. **Additional Screen Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating `extra_screen` might be incorrect. It assumes that every 15 cells can accommodate one 1x1 icon, which is not always true due to the layout constraints.

### Correct Solution

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that we place the icons in a way that minimizes the number of screens used. Here’s a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        screens = 0
        while y > 0:
            screens += 1
            y -= 2
        while x > 0:
            if x >= 4:
                screens += 1
                x -= 4
            else:
                screens += 1
                break
        result.append(screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in how it calculates the number of screens required. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
