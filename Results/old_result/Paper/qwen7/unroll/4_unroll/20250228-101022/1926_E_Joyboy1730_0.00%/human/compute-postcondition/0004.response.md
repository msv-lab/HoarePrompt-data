Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes pairs of integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). The function returns results based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `k`. It processes these pairs and returns outputs based on the relationship between `n` and `k` for each pair within the given constraints.
