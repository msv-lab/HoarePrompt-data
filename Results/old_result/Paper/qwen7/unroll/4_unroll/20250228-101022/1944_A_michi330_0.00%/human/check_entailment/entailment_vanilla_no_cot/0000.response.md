Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all scenarios as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Case where `k < n - 1`:**
   - If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the program should ensure that Everule can still visit some islands beyond just island 1. The logic should consider the optimal way to destroy bridges to minimize the number of reachable islands, which is not fully addressed in the current implementation.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program incorrectly prints `n - 1` when `k < n - 1`, which means it assumes that destroying fewer than `n - 1` bridges would leave all islands reachable, which is not necessarily true due to the specific connectivity requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

- If `k >= n - 1`, then all bridges except one can be destroyed, leaving only one island reachable (island 1).
- If `k < n - 1`, we need to determine the minimum number of islands that can be made unreachable. This involves calculating how many groups of islands can be isolated by destroying the necessary bridges.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            # Determine the minimum number of islands that can be isolated
            min_islands_unreachable = math.ceil((n - 1 - k) / (n - 1))
            print(min_islands_unreachable + 1)

func()
```

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all edge cases and computes the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit optimally.
