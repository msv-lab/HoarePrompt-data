The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks whether \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints '1'; otherwise, it prints \( n - 1 \). The function reads these values from user input and outputs the results, repeating this process for \( t \) times, where \( t \) is also provided by the user and represents the number of test cases.
