### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the function summary.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by setting each element \(a_{i,j}\) to its maximum possible value, which is \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and prints it along with the number of operations required.
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum \(s\) is \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\).
   - It also prints \(2n\) operations, which are of type 1 and type 2, respectively, where each operation sets the entire row or column to a descending permutation of numbers from \(n\) to \(1\).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - The formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\) is incorrect. Let's derive the correct formula.
     - Each element in the matrix can be set to \(n\), and since there are \(n^2\) elements, the maximum sum is \(n^3\).
     - Therefore, the correct formula should be \(n^3\).

   - The operations performed (permuting each row and each column to descending order) do not necessarily achieve the maximum sum. Setting each row or column to a descending permutation of numbers from \(n\) to \(1\) will result in a sum of \(n^3 / 2\) because each element \(a_{i,j}\) will be set to \(n\) only half the time due to the symmetry of the operations.

   - The solution claims to use \(2n\) operations, but the actual operations do not achieve the maximum sum. The correct approach would be to set each element to \(n\) directly, which can be done in \(n^2\) operations, but the given solution uses \(2n\) operations, which is not optimal.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The formula and the operations do not achieve the maximum sum as required.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
