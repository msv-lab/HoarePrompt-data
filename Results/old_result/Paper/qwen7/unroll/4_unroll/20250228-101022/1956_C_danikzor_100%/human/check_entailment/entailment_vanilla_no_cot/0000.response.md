Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the operations it performs do not maximize the sum of the matrix as required. Instead, the program seems to be attempting a different approach that does not align with the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that the matrix is filled in such a way that the sum is maximized using no more than \(2n\) operations. The correct approach involves strategically setting rows and columns to permutations of the sequence from 1 to \(n\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(n * n, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *[j for j in range(1, n + 1)])
        print(2, i, *[j for j in range(1, n + 1)])
```

This corrected program sets each row and each column to a permutation of the sequence from 1 to \(n\), ensuring that the sum of the matrix is maximized.
