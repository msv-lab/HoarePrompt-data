Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 500. The new information about `n` being an integer within the range 1 to 500 is added to the initial state.
