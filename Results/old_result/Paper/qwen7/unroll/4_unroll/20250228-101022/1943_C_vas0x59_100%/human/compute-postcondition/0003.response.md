Output State: `n` vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list represents the adjacency list of the corresponding vertex. After executing the loop, each vertex will have its adjacent vertices added to its adjacency list, forming a connected tree structure with `n-1` edges.
