Output State: **`n` vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge, `d` is the distance from vertex 0 to all other vertices, `_` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the `bfs` function with the starting vertex `0`. The `bfs` function returns two values: the distance `d` from vertex `0` to all other vertices in the tree, and another variable `_` (which is typically used for ignoring a value). After the function call, `d` is updated with the distances, while `_` remains unchanged. The initial state of `n` and `u2vs` remains the same.
