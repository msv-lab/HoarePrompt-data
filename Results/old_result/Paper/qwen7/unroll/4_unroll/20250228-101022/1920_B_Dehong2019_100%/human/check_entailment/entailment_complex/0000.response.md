Reasoning:
1. The function correctly initializes by reading the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and sorts the array `a` in descending order.
3. It calculates `ans1` as the initial sum of the array `a`.
4. It then iteratively adjusts `ans1` by removing the smallest elements (considering both Alice's and Bob's moves).
5. The function updates `ans2` to be the maximum value of `ans1` after each iteration, which ensures that the optimal strategy is followed.
6. Finally, it prints `ans2` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the function appears to correctly implement the described game rules and calculate the optimal sum of the array after both players have made their moves.

Correctness: **True**
