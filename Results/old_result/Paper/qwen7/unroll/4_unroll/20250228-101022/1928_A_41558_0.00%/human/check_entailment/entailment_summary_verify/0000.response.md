Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

### Problem Description Analysis
According to the problem, Bob can form a new rectangle from the original rectangle if:
1. At least one of the dimensions is even.
2. The dimensions do not satisfy the specific conditions where one dimension is exactly half of the other.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program checks the following conditions:
1. If both dimensions are odd (`a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`), it prints 'NO'.
2. If one dimension is exactly half of the other (`a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`), it also prints 'NO'.
3. In all other cases, it prints 'YES'.

### Function Summary Analysis
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program:
- It processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it checks if both dimensions are odd or if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
- If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Evaluation
To determine the correctness of the program, let's verify its behavior against the problem requirements:

1. **Case when both dimensions are even**: 
   - If both dimensions are even, the program should print 'YES'. For example, for input `2 4`, the program should print 'YES' because Bob can cut the 2x4 rectangle into two 2x2 rectangles and rearrange them to form a 4x2 rectangle.
   - The current implementation correctly handles this case since it does not check for both dimensions being odd or one being exactly half of the other.

2. **Case when both dimensions are odd**:
   - If both dimensions are odd, the program should print 'NO'. For example, for input `3 5`, the program should print 'NO' because neither dimension is even, and one dimension is not exactly half of the other.
   - The current implementation correctly handles this case.

3. **Case when one dimension is exactly half of the other**:
   - If one dimension is exactly half of the other, the program should print 'NO'. For example, for input `2 4`, the program should print 'NO' because one dimension (2) is exactly half of the other (4).
   - The current implementation correctly handles this case.

4. **Case when at least one dimension is even but not exactly half of the other**:
   - If at least one dimension is even but not exactly half of the other, the program should print 'YES'. For example, for input `2 6`, the program should print 'YES' because one dimension (2) is even, and the other (6) is not exactly half of 2.
   - The current implementation correctly handles this case.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
