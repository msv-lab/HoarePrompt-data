Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function likely processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `a`, and `b`, and returns a specific value or result for each test case based on these inputs. However, without the exact logic, we can only describe the implied input structure and the expected behavior in terms of processing these inputs.
