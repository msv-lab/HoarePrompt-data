Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range` function. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.

3. **Determine the value of `int(input())`**: The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input. For the loop to execute, this integer must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would result in no iterations).

4. **Initial state of `t`**: The variable `t` is mentioned as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\). This information is not directly relevant to the loop head but is part of the overall context. However, since `t` is not used in the loop itself, we do not need to adjust its state specifically for the loop to execute.

5. **Variables `a` and `b`**: These variables are mentioned in the problem statement but are not part of the loop head. Therefore, their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the above points, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` and the value read from `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, the integer read from `int(input())` must be at least 1**
