Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case contains a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, two positive integers `a` and `b` such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `a`, `b`, and potentially `t`.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `a`, and `b`, and returns specific information derived from these values, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
