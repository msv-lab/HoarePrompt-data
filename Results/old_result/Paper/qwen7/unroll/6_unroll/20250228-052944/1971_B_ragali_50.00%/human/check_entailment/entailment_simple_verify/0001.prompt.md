You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.

            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each string `s` entered during the loop iterations, based on whether the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rotation of the other. If such a condition is met, it prints the rotated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The specific strings and their rotations depend on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Creating a Set of Characters:**
   - A set `a` is created to store unique characters from the string `s`.
   - If the size of the set `a` is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string.

3. **Checking for Rearrangement Possibility:**
   - If there are more than one unique characters, the program tries to create a new string `r` by rearranging the characters of `s`.
   - It attempts to create `r` by splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order (`s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]`).
   - If this rearrangement does not match the original string `s`, it prints the rearranged string.
   - If the rearranged string matches `s`, it checks if reversing the entire string `s` gives a different string. If so, it prints the reversed string.
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, it prints the rearranged string again.

4. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the set `a` has only one element (i.e., `len(a) == 1`), it means the string `s` consists of a single character repeated multiple times.
   - In such cases, the program prints 'NO' because any rearrangement of the string would still result in the same string.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles strings with even and odd lengths correctly.
   - However, it might not handle all edge cases properly, especially when the string length is small (e.g., length 2 or 3).

### Testing Examples:
Let's test the program with some examples to see if it works as expected:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `codeforces`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by a rearranged string like `forcodesec`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `aaaaa`
- Expected Output: `NO`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `xxxxy`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by a rearranged string like `xxyxx`

#### Example 4:
- Input: `co`
- Expected Output: `YES` followed by a rearranged string like `oc`

#### Example 5:
- Input: `d`
- Expected Output: `NO`

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, we can see that it generally works correctly for most cases but might have issues with handling very short strings (length 2 or 3) and ensuring the rearranged string is different from the original. 

However, based on the problem statement and the examples provided, the program seems to meet the requirements for most test cases.
