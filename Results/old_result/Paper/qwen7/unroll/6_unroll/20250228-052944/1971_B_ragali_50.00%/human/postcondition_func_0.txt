The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and a string \( s \). For each string \( s \), it checks if the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rotation of the other. If such a condition is met, it prints the rotated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each string based on this check.
