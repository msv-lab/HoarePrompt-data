You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.

    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        
        a = set()
        
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)

            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each string `s` entered during the loop iterations, based on whether the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rotation of the other. If such a condition is met, it prints the rotated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The specific strings and their rotations depend on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and a string \( s \). For each string \( s \), it checks if the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rotation of the other. If such a condition is met, it prints the rotated string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each string based on this check.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the input string consists of exactly two distinct characters. For example, consider the input string "aaab":

- The program will identify that there are more than one unique character (`a` and `b`), so it proceeds to rearrange the string.
- It attempts to create a new string by splitting the original string at the middle and swapping the halves. However, this approach does not guarantee a different string in all cases.

Let's consider the input "aaab":
- The program will split the string into "aab" and "aa".
- It will then concatenate "aa" and "aab" to form "aaab", which is the same as the original string.

This results in the program failing to generate a different string, even though such a string should exist. Therefore, the program is incorrect for at least one potential case.
