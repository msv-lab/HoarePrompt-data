Output State: The output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each string `s` provided, based on whether the string can be split into two halves such that one half is a rearrangement of the other. If it can, the program prints the rearranged string; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The exact output strings depend on the input strings `s`.
