Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order, and `output2` contains the corresponding quotients for each divisor in the reversed `output1`.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in place. This means that the order of elements in `output1` is now the reverse of what it was before. The value of `output2` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by this operation.
