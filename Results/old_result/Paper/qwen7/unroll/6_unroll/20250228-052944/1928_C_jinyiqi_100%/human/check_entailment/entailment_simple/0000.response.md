Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Condition Checking**: The program checks two conditions:
   - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the total length of the settling sequence (2k-2) is even, which is necessary for the settling to repeat properly.
   - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This condition ensures that the position `x` is within the bounds of the repeating sequence.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order. This is used to determine possible values of `k` that could fit the given constraints.
   - The logic for finding divisors is correct, and the returned list contains all divisors of `x` in a concatenated form of quotients and divisors.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - For each valid divisor `s` from `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. This condition ensures that the calculated `k` fits the given position `x`.
   - The results are stored in a set to avoid duplicates and then the size of the set is printed, which gives the number of valid `k` values.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
