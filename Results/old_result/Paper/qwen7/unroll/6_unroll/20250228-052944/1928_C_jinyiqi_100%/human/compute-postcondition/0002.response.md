Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `x ** 0.5`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` until `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1 (which is always true since `x` is an integer and `x >= 1`).

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 and the loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at 1, we need to ensure that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 1, which means `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 0. Given that `x` is an integer and `1 <= x < n <= 10^9`, `x` must be at least 1, making `int(x ** 0.5)` at least 1.

4. **Final state adjustment**:
   - `x` is already defined and within the given range.
   - `i` should start at 1.
   - `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1, which means `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1.

Given these points, the state adjustments needed are:

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `int(x ** 0.5)` must be at least 1**
