### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic of the program. Let's break down the program and verify each part:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received during the settling.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are used to ensure that the total length of the settling sequence (which is `2k - 2`) is even. This is correct because the sequence must repeat properly.

3. **Generating Divisors:**
   - The function `func_1(x)` correctly generates all divisors of `x` by iterating from 1 to the square root of `x` and collecting both `i` and `x // i`.

4. **Filtering Valid `k` Values:**
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, the program checks if `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`. This ensures that the derived `k` value is valid because the sequence length `2k - 2` must be at least `2x`.

5. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates before calculating the length is correct, ensuring that each valid `k` value is counted only once.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - The provided examples match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the program.

Given the detailed analysis and the verification of each step, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
