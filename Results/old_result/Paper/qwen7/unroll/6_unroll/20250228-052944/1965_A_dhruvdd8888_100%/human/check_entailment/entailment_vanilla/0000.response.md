Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle one test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `N` and the sizes of the piles.
   - It then converts the input string into a set of integers and adds '0' to it.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `ls` and `nw`, `cw`.
   - It iterates through the sorted list in reverse order, updating the values of `ls` and the booleans `nw` and `cw`.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The logic seems to be attempting to simulate the game and determine the winner based on the parity of the number of moves.
   - However, the implementation of the logic is flawed. Specifically:
     - The conversion of the input string to a set and adding '0' does not make sense in this context.
     - The sorting and subsequent operations do not correctly simulate the game rules.
     - The logic for determining the winner is not based on the correct game strategy.

3. **Game Strategy**:
   - The game is a classic example of the Nim game variant, where the key is to ensure that after each move, the XOR of the pile sizes is non-zero.
   - If the XOR of the pile sizes is zero at the start, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.
   - If the XOR of the pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the XOR of all pile sizes.
   - If the XOR is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

### Corrected Program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    xor_val = 0
    for num in nums:
        xor_val ^= num
    if xor_val == 0:
        print('Bob')
    else:
        print('Alice')
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules. The correct approach involves calculating the XOR of all pile sizes and determining the winner based on that value.

**Correctness: False**
