Output State: **`ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is initially from the original list minus `ls`, and `nw` is set to True.**

Explanation: The variable `nw` is set to `True` in the given code snippet. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `nw` and retains the initial states of `ls`, `t`, `N`, and `nums`.
