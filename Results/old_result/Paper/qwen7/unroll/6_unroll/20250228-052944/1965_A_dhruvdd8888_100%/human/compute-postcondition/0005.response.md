Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used as the index in the `range(len(nums))` expression.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (as `range(len(nums))` generates indices starting from 0), `i` should be initialized to 0.

3. **Determine the state of `nums`**: The loop will iterate over the length of `nums`. Therefore, `nums` must be a non-empty list. Given that `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and '0' is added to the set `nums`, `nums` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be 0.
   - `nums` must be a non-empty list.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in ascending order and '0' is added to the set `nums`**.
