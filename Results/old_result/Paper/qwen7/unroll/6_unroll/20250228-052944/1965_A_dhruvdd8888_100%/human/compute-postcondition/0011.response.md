Output State: `cw` is False, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is initially from the original list minus `ls`, and `nw` is set to False.

Explanation: The loop iterates over the `nums` list from the second last element to the first element. If `nums[i]` equals 1, `cw` is set to the opposite of `nw`. Otherwise, `cw` is set to `True`. Since `nw` starts as `True` and `cw` is updated based on the value of `nums[i]` and the current state of `nw`, and given that the loop does not change the values of `ls`, `t`, or `N`, the final state of `cw` will be `False` because it will toggle based on the number of times `nums[i]` equals 1, and `nw` will end up as `False` after the loop completes.
