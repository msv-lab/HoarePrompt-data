Output State: `cw` is False, `ls` is the sum of all elements in `nums`, `t` remains a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in descending order where each element is initially from the original list minus `ls`, and `nw` is set to False.

Explanation: The loop iterates over `nums` from the second last element to the first element. If `nums[i]` equals 1, `cw` is toggled based on the value of `nw`. Otherwise, `cw` is set to `True`. Since `nw` starts as `True` and `cw` is only toggled when `nums[i]` is 1, and given that `nums` is sorted in descending order (meaning it will contain 1s at the end if present), `cw` will eventually become `False` if there is at least one 1 in `nums`. If there are no 1s in `nums`, `cw` will remain `True` until the last iteration where it gets toggled to `False` due to `nw` being `True`.
