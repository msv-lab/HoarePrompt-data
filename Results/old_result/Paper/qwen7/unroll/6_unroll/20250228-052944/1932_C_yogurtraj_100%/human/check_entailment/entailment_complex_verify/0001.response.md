### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program. Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `k` should be initialized as the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m`. However, the original program incorrectly initializes `k` based on the last character of `s`.
   - The variables `q1` and `q2` are set based on the last character of `s`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the entire sequence of operations as required.

3. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array `y` of size `n` is initialized with zeros. This is correct.

4. **Setting Initial Value:**
   - The value `k` should be set as the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m`. The original program sets `k` based on the last character of `s`, which is incorrect.

5. **Loop through the Commands:**
   - The loop iterates backward through the string `s` starting from the second last character.
   - If the command is 'R', it multiplies `k` by the next element in the array and updates `q2`.
   - If the command is 'L', it multiplies `k` by the previous element in the array and updates `q1`.
   - This logic is mostly correct but needs adjustments for the initial setup and handling of the first command.

6. **Output:**
   - The results are stored in `y` and printed correctly.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Initialization of `k`:**
   - `k` should be initialized as the product of all elements of the array `a` modulo `m`, not based on the last character of `s`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `q1` and `q2`:**
   - `q1` and `q2` should be initialized to the appropriate indices based on the first command in `s`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        t = input()
        
        # Initialize k as the product of all elements modulo m
        k = 1
        for num in a:
            k = (k * num) % m
        
        # Initialize q1 and q2 based on the first command
        if t[0] == 'L':
            q1 = 1
            q2 = 0
        else:
            q1 = 0
            q2 = 1
        
        y = [0] * n
        y[0] = k
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if t[i-1] == 'R':
                k = (k * a[q2]) % m
                q2 += 1
            else:
                k = (k * a[q1]) % m
                q1 -= 1
            y[i] = k
        
        print(*y)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program had logical errors in initializing `k` and handling `q1` and `q2`. After correcting these issues, the program should work as expected.
