You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the bribing cost when moving Kirill to a position within the first `m` positions. 

The issue lies in how the variable `x` is being updated and used. The variable `x` accumulates the cost of bribing people between the current position and the start of the queue, but it does not correctly reflect the cost of bribing people who are already in positions less than `i`. Additionally, the logic to update `pergunta` does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move to a position within the first `m` people.

Here is an example that highlights the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
2
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

The expected output should be `14`, but the program outputs `13`.

- For the first person (`i=0`), the cost to bribe them is `7`.
- For the second person (`i=1`), the cost to bribe them is `3`.
- For the third person (`i=2`), the cost to bribe them is `6`, and the accumulated cost `x` becomes `7 + 3 + 6 = 16`. Since `i < m`, we should consider the cost `a[2]` which is `6`, and the minimum cost is `min(16, 6) = 6`.
- For the fourth person (`i=3`), the cost to bribe them is `9`, and the accumulated cost `x` becomes `16 + 9 = 25`. Since `i < m`, we should consider the cost `a[3]` which is `9`, and the minimum cost is `min(25, 9) = 9`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost without properly accounting for the cumulative cost of bribing people who are already in positions less than `i`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly accumulate and update the cost of bribing people and ensure that the minimum cost is calculated properly for each position.
