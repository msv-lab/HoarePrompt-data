Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes variables `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` based on the input.
3. **Dynamic Calculation**: It uses a loop to iterate backward through the queue (from the last person to the first). For each person, it calculates the cost of moving Kirill to that position and updates the minimum cost accordingly.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The cost includes the cost of bribing the person at the current position (`a[i]`) and the cost of bribing all people between the current position and the target position (`b[k]` for all `k` such that `j < k < i`).
5. **Result Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the minimum cost by considering the costs of bribing people both directly and indirectly. The backward iteration ensures that the cumulative cost is correctly calculated, and the minimum cost is updated whenever a lower cost is found.
