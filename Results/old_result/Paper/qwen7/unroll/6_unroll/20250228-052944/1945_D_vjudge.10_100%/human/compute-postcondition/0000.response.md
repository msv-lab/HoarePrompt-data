Output State: **pergunta is a string, a and b are lists of non-negative integers with length n, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n <= 200000, and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 200000, x is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `x` to 0. All other variables (`pergunta`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `m`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
