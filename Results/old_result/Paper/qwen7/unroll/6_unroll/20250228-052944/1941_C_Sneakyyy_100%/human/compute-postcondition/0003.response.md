Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length not exceeding 10^6. For each test case, it returns a result based on the value of `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), which is derived from `t` and the properties of `s`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case individually, where `t` indicates the number of test cases, and within each test case, `n` is a positive integer up to 10^6, and `s` is a string of lowercase Latin letters. The exact nature of the return value isn't specified in the given information, but it implies that the function performs some operation based on `n` and `s` for each test case.
