Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables**:
   - `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - The loop iterates based on the input value, which is an integer read from the input.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will run for as many times as the integer input value. Therefore, the input value must be a positive integer within the specified range.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given the above points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute correctly based on the input value.
