Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to eliminate occurrences of the substrings "map" or "pie".
2. The provided code iterates through the string `a` and checks for the substrings "map" and "pie". When either of these substrings is found, it increments the counter `ans` and skips ahead by 3 characters (`i += 3`), effectively removing those characters from consideration in subsequent iterations.
3. The logic correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters necessary to make the string beautiful.
4. The code handles multiple test cases as specified, reading the number of test cases `t`, followed by the length `n` and content of the string `s` for each test case.
5. The output is the count of deletions required for each test case, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
