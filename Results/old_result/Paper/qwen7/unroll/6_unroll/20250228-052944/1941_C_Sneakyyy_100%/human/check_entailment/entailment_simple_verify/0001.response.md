### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Length and Content**: For each test case, the program correctly reads the length `n` of the string `a` and the string itself.
3. **Substring Check**: The program checks substrings of length 3 starting from index `i` to see if they match either "map" or "pie". If a match is found, it increments the counter `ans` and skips the next two characters (`i += 3`).
4. **Increment Logic**: If no match is found, the program simply increments the index `i` by 1 (`i += 1`).
5. **Output**: After processing the entire string, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

### Analysis:
- The logic to find and count the occurrences of "map" or "pie" in the string is correct.
- The program correctly handles the removal of characters by skipping them when a match is found.
- However, the program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "ppiee", the program would only detect one occurrence of "pie" and delete two characters, but it should detect two occurrences and delete three characters to make the string beautiful.

### Example Counter-Example:
Consider the string "ppiee":
- The program would process the string as follows:
  - At index 0: "ppi" (no match)
  - At index 1: "pie" (match, increment `ans` and skip next two characters)
  - Total deletions: 2 (incorrect, should be 3)

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle overlapping substrings properly. It only counts non-overlapping occurrences of "map" or "pie".

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
