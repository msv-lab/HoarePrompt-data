Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and `ans` is a set initialized with the initial player `x`. `n`, `m`, and `x` have been assigned the values returned by `func_3()`**.

The code `n, m, x = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which presumably returns three values: `n`, `m`, and `x`. These values replace the existing values of `n`, `m`, and `x` from the initial state. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this assignment.
