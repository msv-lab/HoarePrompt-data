You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the initial player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and the direction c separated by a space.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: Output State: The set `ans` contains the positions of all players who could potentially have the ball after `m` throws, based on the operations defined in the loop. Each operation either adds or subtracts `r` from the current player's position modulo `n`, and the result is added to the set `temp`. Since `c` can be '0', '1', or '?' which allows both addition and subtraction, the final set `ans` will include all possible positions that the ball could have been passed to through the given operations.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: The set `ans` contains all the positions of players who could potentially have the ball after `m` throws, including the position `n` if `0` is in the set `ans`. If `0` is not in the set `ans`, the set remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set ans, which could be the original size plus one if 0 is in the set)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: sorted(ans) where ans is a set containing all the positions of players who could potentially have the ball after m throws, and if 0 is in ans, n is also added to the set
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies that it works with global variables n, m, x, and ans. It returns a string containing the distance r and the direction c separated by a space.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
