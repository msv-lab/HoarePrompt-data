### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. This function is used to read input lines in subsequent functions.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: Calls `func_1()` and returns an integer value, which is the number of test cases (`t`). This sets up the loop to process each test case.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: Calls `func_1()` to get a string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer. This function is used to parse the initial input for each test case, providing the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`.

4. **Function `func_4()`**: This is the core function that processes each test case. It:
   - Initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - Iterates through each throw, reading the distance `r` and direction `c`.
   - Updates the set `ans` to include the possible new positions of the ball based on the direction of the throw.
   - Handles the special case where the position 0 is included and replaces it with `n`.
   - Outputs the number of unique positions the ball could be in and lists these positions in ascending order.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary of `func_4()`, the logic implemented in `func_4()` correctly simulates the movement of the ball based on the given rules and constraints. The function handles both clockwise and counterclockwise movements appropriately and ensures that the ball's position wraps around the circle of players.

### Correctness:
Since the implementation of `func_4()` accurately follows the problem description and correctly calculates the possible positions of the ball after all throws, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
