Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18 and `x` is equal to `x - 1`, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was initially a positive integer between 1 and 1000. The variable `x` is decreased by 1, making it an integer between 1 and 10^18 (since it was originally between 2 and 10^18). The new value of `x` is specifically `x - 1`. The variable `subseq_lens` is initialized as an empty list.
