Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for each position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, it should check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  aa
  bb
  ab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this case, the function returns `NO` because it incorrectly assumes that since `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same positions, the strings do not match the template. However, a valid template could be "AA", where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, and the output is incorrect for this and potentially other cases.
