Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for result in results:`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), and it represents the number of iterations the loop executed.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, a, b, c)`.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration of the loop, `result` takes one value from the `results` list.
   - The loop continues until all elements in the `results` list are processed.

4. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - Since the loop is iterating over the `results` list, the initial state of `results` must be such that it contains at least one element (since `t` is at least 1).
   - The variable `t` should be set to the actual number of iterations, which is the length of the `results` list.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly is:

- `results` must be a list with at least one element.
- `t` must be equal to the length of the `results` list.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `results` is a list with at least one element, and `t` is the length of the `results` list.**
