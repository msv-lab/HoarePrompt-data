### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and their summaries to determine if they correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
  - Both `a` and `b` match the template `t`.
  - `c` does not match the template `t`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
```python
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
- This function iterates over each character in the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It checks if for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.
- If such a position is found, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that a valid template exists.
- If no such position is found after checking all characters, it returns `'NO'`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```
- This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
- It calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each test case and collects the results.
- Finally, it prints each result.

#### Function Summaries Recap:
- Function `func_2` processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each and collecting the results.
- Function `func_1` checks if there exists a position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly points out that `func_1` does not ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.
- The current implementation of `func_1` only checks if there is a position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This is insufficient because it does not guarantee that `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

To illustrate with the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Test Case**: 
  ```
  1
  2
  aa
  bb
  ab
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  YES
  ```
- **Actual Output**: 
  ```
  NO
  ```
- **Explanation**: 
  - `func_1` returns `NO` because it only checks if there is a position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. In this case, `a[0]` and `b[0]` are both 'a' which is different from 'b' at position 0, but `a[1]` and `b[1]` are both 'a' which is the same as 'b' at position 1. Therefore, `func_1` incorrectly returns `NO`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check if there exists a template where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.
