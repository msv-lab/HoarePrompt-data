You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

Example

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (number of iterations), an integer `n` (length of strings), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n`). For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` to perform some unspecified operations and collects the results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` checks if for each position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` is different from `c[i]`. However, this does not guarantee that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, it should check if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  aa
  bb
  ab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this case, the function returns `NO` because it incorrectly assumes that since `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same positions, the strings do not match the template. However, a valid template could be "AA", where both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description, and the output is incorrect for this and potentially other cases.
