Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and it is assigned the value of `int(input().strip())`; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variable `t` retains its initial state as an integer between 1 and 1000, assigned the value from user input stripped of any leading/trailing whitespace. No changes are made to `t` within the given code snippet, and `results` is newly initialized as an empty list.
