Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing the sum of differences and adjustments made based on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each set of inputs `(n, k, a)`, the value of `ans` is calculated by sorting the list `a`, then iteratively adjusting `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the value of `k`. After processing all elements or exhausting `k`, any remaining `k` is evenly distributed among the elements. Finally, `ans` is incremented by a formula involving `n-1` and `res`. Each calculated `ans` is appended to `ans_list`.
