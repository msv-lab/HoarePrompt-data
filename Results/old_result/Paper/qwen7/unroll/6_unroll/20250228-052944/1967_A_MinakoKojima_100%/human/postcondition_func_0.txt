The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given logic involving sorting the list \( a \), adjusting the value of \( ans \) based on differences between consecutive elements in \( a \) and the integer \( k \). After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated values for each test case.
