Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem asks for the maximum possible sum of an array after performing \(k\) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The key insight here is that inserting the sum of a subarray can potentially increase the overall sum of the array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The provided solution calculates the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`) using Kadane's algorithm.
   - It then uses this maximum subarray sum to compute the final result: \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\).

3. **Analysis of the Solution**:
   - **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation**: The code correctly uses Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum (`maxi`).
   - **Final Result Calculation**: The formula \((2^k \times \text{maxi} - \text{maxi} + \text{sum}(l)) \mod 1000000007\) is derived from the observation that inserting the sum of the maximum subarray \(k\) times can significantly increase the array's sum. This formula accounts for the fact that each insertion of the maximum subarray sum contributes to the total sum, but also subtracts the initial `maxi` to avoid overcounting.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The solution handles negative numbers correctly by considering the absolute value when updating the current sum (`c`).
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required range.
   - The solution correctly processes multiple test cases as specified.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and aligns with the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
