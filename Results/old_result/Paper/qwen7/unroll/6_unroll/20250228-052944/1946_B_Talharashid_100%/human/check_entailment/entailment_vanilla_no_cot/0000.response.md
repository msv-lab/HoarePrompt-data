Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Subarray Sum**: The code attempts to calculate the maximum subarray sum using a simple loop, but it does not correctly handle the logic needed to maximize the sum after performing the operations. It uses a variable `c` to accumulate positive sums and checks if negative elements should reset `c`, which is not the optimal approach for this problem.

2. **Incorrect Use of Exponentiation**: The line `2 ** k * maxi` is used without properly handling large values and potential overflow issues. This could lead to incorrect results due to the large value of `k`.

3. **Logic for Operations**: The problem allows inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array. The current implementation does not account for the optimal way to use these operations to maximize the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand that the optimal strategy is to use the sum of the entire array as many times as possible in the operations. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array
        total_sum = sum(arr)
        
        # If k is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can make all elements positive
        if k >= n:
            result = (total_sum * (2 ** k - 1)) % MOD
        else:
            # Otherwise, we can only use the sum of the array k times
            result = (total_sum * k) % MOD
        
        print(result)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Calculate the sum of the array.
2. If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, we can make all elements positive by using the sum of the array `2^k - 1` times.
3. If `k` is less than the length of the array, we can only use the sum of the array `k` times.

This approach ensures that we get the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
