You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, N is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of N non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < N. The value of t is incremented for each unique element in the list a until either two unique elements are found or a zero is encountered. If two unique elements are found or a zero is encountered, the index of the first unique element is printed and the loop breaks. The output state describes the indices of the first unique elements for each test case or the first zero encountered, whichever comes first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \(N\) and a list of \(N\) non-negative integers \(a\). It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. The function increments a counter \(t\) for each unique integer until it finds either two unique integers or encounters a zero. If two unique integers are found or a zero is encountered, it prints the index of the first unique integer and stops processing further integers in the current test case. The function does not return any value but prints the index of the first unique integer or the first zero for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c`. According to the problem description, Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively. However, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or consider their optimal strategies.

The program simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and prints the first number that appears exactly once or when the count of a number becomes zero. This approach does not account for the turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will produce incorrect results because it does not simulate the game properly. For instance, in the first test case, the program would incorrectly print `0` instead of `2` because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
