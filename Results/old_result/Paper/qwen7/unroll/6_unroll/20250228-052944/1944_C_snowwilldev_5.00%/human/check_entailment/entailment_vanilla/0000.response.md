Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - This part is correct and necessary for determining the optimal strategy.

3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to keep track of the number of unique elements seen so far.
   - It iterates through the array and increments `t` whenever it encounters an element that appears exactly once.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if an element does not appear at all (`cnt[i] == 0`), it prints the current index `i` and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Strategy**:
   - The program assumes that the optimal strategy involves counting the number of unique elements seen so far and printing the first index where either `t` reaches 2 or the element does not appear at all.
   - This logic does not align with the problem statement, which requires Alice and Bob to play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.

2. **Misunderstanding of Game Rules**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, and then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The program does not simulate these turns or consider the strategic choices of both players.

3. **Output MEX Calculation**:
   - The program outputs an index without considering the actual MEX of the array `c` formed during the optimal play of both players.
   - The MEX should be calculated after the game ends, not during the process of counting unique elements.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to simulate the optimal play of both players and incorrectly calculates the MEX.

**Correctness: False**
