Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal game score between Alice and Bob. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Objective Misunderstanding**: The program attempts to find the first unique element or the first zero in the list `a` and prints its index. However, the objective is to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.

2. **Game Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob make their moves according to the rules. It simply counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and finds the first unique or zero element, which does not reflect the optimal strategy for the game.

3. **Output Mismatch**: The output of the program is the index of the first unique element or the first zero in `a`, which is not the MEX of the array `c`. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
