Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and calculate the MEX of the array `c`. According to the problem description, Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively. However, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or consider their optimal strategies.

The program simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and prints the first number that appears exactly once or when the count of a number becomes zero. This approach does not account for the turns of Alice and Bob and their respective strategies to maximize and minimize the MEX.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will produce incorrect results because it does not simulate the game properly. For instance, in the first test case, the program would incorrectly print `0` instead of `2` because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
