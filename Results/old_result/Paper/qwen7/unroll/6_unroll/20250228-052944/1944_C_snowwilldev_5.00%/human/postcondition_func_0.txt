The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \(N\) and a list of \(N\) non-negative integers \(a\). It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the list. The function increments a counter \(t\) for each unique integer until it finds either two unique integers or encounters a zero. If two unique integers are found or a zero is encountered, it prints the index of the first unique integer and stops processing further integers in the current test case. The function does not return any value but prints the index of the first unique integer or the first zero for each test case.
