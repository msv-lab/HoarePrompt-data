### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function `func_1` in detail, considering the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if `b` is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If `b` is even, it returns 'yes'.
   - If `b` is odd, it returns 'no'.

2. **Problem Description and Functionality**:
   - The problem requires determining if a given rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles and reformed into a new distinct rectangle.
   - The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Examples from the Problem Statement**:
   - For the input `2 6`, the function returns 'yes' because `6 % 2 == 0`. However, the problem description states that a 2x6 rectangle can be split into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 3x4 rectangle. Thus, the function correctly identifies this case.
   - For the input `3 2`, the function returns 'no' because `2 % 2 == 0`. However, the problem description states that a 3x2 rectangle can be split into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle. Thus, the function incorrectly identifies this case as not possible.

4. **General Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, or vice versa. For example, a 4x3 rectangle can be split into two 4x1.5 rectangles (which is not valid since we need integer sides), but it can also be split into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle.
   - The function `func_1` does not consider the possibility of splitting along the length (i.e., `a`) and then rearranging the pieces.

Given the examples and the problem description, the function `func_1` is indeed incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing many other valid cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a new rectangle can be formed from the given dimensions.
