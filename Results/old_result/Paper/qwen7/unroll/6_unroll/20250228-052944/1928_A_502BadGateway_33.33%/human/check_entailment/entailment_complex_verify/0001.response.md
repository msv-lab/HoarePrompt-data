### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program only checks if `b` is even, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The program fails to consider the case where `a` is even. 

To properly solve the problem, the function `func_1` should check if either `a` or `b` is even. Here's why:

1. **Case 1: Both Dimensions are Even:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are even, the rectangle can be cut into four smaller rectangles of equal size, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - Example: A 4x4 rectangle can be cut into four 2x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 2x8 rectangle.

2. **Case 2: One Dimension is Even, the Other is Odd:**
   - If one dimension is even and the other is odd, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles where at least one dimension is even.
   - Example: A 4x3 rectangle can be cut into two 4x1.5 rectangles, but since we need integer dimensions, it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 6x2 rectangle.

3. **Case 3: Both Dimensions are Odd:**
   - If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into smaller rectangles that can form a new distinct rectangle.
   - Example: A 3x3 rectangle can only be cut into 1x3 rectangles, and these cannot be rearranged to form a new distinct rectangle.

The correct function should be:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
```

This function checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, the function returns `'yes'`, indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, the function returns `'no'`.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not correctly identify the need to check both dimensions `a` and `b`. The correct function should check if either dimension is even.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
