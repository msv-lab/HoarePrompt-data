Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from a given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- The provided code only checks if \(b\) is even using the function `func_1(a, b)`. If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes', otherwise 'no'.
- However, the logic in `func_1` is incomplete for solving the problem. For example, if \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), the function correctly returns 'no' because no cuts can be made. But for other cases, such as \(a = 2\) and \(b = 3\), the function incorrectly returns 'no' when it should return 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 3\) rectangles and rearranged into a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle.
- The function should consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle and check if the resulting pieces can form another distinct rectangle.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code does not fully solve the problem as described. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
