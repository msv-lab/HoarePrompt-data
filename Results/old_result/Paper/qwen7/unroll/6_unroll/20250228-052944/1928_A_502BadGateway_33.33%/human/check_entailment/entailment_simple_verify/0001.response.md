### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the provided program is incorrect. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements:**
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can form another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - The key observation is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into smaller pieces that can form a new distinct rectangle.

2. **Provided Program Analysis:**
   - The program calls `func_1(a, b)` for each test case.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` checks if `b` is even using the condition `b % 2 == 0`.
   - If `b` is even, it returns `'yes'`; otherwise, it returns `'no'`.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The program correctly identifies the case where `b` is even, but it fails to consider the case where `a` is even.
   - For example, a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 1.5\) rectangles, but since we need integer dimensions, it can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 2\) rectangle.
   - Similarly, a \(3 \times 4\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 2\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a \(6 \times 2\) rectangle.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if either `a` or `b` is even.
   - The correct implementation would be:
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         return 'yes' if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0 else 'no'
     ```

5. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program only checks if `b` is even, missing the case where `a` is even.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is even, missing the case where `a` is even.
