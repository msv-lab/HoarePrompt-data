Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles and reading the book with the highest number in each pile.
2. The provided solution sorts the list of book pages in descending order and then prints the sum of the first two elements, which corresponds to the two largest numbers in the list.
3. This approach correctly identifies the two largest books in the pile and sums their page counts, which is the maximum possible total for any division of the books.
4. The solution handles multiple test cases as specified, iterating through each test case and performing the required operation.

Given these points, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
