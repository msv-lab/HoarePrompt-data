Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The conditions and values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the list of starting nodes remain unchanged.
