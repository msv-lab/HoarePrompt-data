### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `q` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Stair Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
4. **Peak Condition Check**: The program checks if `a < b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
5. **Default Case**: If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.

The logic implemented in the program matches the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.
