The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it prints one of three outcomes: 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), or 'NONE' for all other cases. The final state of the program is a series of outputs corresponding to each test case, with each output indicating whether the numbers form a 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or neither.
