You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
    if order == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False



- Annotated Code: 
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    if func_1(a, num2):
        print(0)
    else:
        beauty = 0
        b = sorted(a)
        for x in range(1, num2):
            beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
        print(beauty)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array elements, and num2 is not used in the function and can be ignored.
def func_1(a, num2):
    order = 0
    for i in range(1, num2):
        if a[i - 1] >= a[i]:
            order += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of integers representing the array elements, and order is the number of adjacent swaps needed to sort the list in non-decreasing order.
    if (order == 0) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    else :
        return False
        #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a` and returns `True` if the list is already sorted in non-decreasing order, otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function and how the main logic is implemented.

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this is not the correct approach for finding the maximum beauty.
   - The function returns `True` if the array is sorted, which means it will always print `0` for the beauty, regardless of the actual arrangement of elements.

2. **Main Logic Issue:**
   - The main logic sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, and then alternate placing the next smallest and largest elements in between.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(0, num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    
    # Sort the array to find the minimum and maximum values
    a.sort()
    
    # Initialize the beauty
    beauty = 0
    
    # Calculate the maximum beauty by placing the smallest and largest values alternately
    for x in range(num2 // 2):
        beauty += a[-(x + 1)] - a[x]
    
    if num2 % 2 != 0:
        beauty += a[num2 // 2]
    
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by alternating the placement of the smallest and largest elements.
