Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. However, this check is unnecessary because the goal is to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The function should not be called at all since it does not contribute to the solution.

2. **Sorting and Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the maximum beauty is correct but the sorting step can be optimized. Instead of sorting the entire array, you only need to sort the differences between consecutive elements, which simplifies the process.

3. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input but the logic for calculating the maximum beauty can be more straightforward. You don't need to sort the entire array; sorting just the differences between consecutive elements is sufficient.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
num = int(input())
for i in range(num):
    num2 = int(input())
    case = input()
    a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
    
    # Sort the array to get the minimum difference first
    b = sorted(a)
    beauty = 0
    for x in range(1, num2):
        beauty += b[x] - b[x - 1]
    
    print(beauty)
```

This corrected version directly calculates the maximum beauty by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized, leading to the correct result.
