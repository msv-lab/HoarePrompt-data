### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, the original assessment includes an unnecessary check using `func_1`, which does not affect the final result since sorting the array will always yield the maximum possible beauty.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   
2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array is sorted using the `sorted(a)` function, which ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After sorting, the program iterates through the sorted array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Unnecessary Check:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. This check is unnecessary because sorting the array will always yield the maximum possible beauty, regardless of the initial order. The beauty calculation remains the same even if the array is already sorted.

Given this analysis, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting it and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. The initial check with `func_1` does not add any value to the solution and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
