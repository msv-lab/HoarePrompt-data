Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The beauty is calculated as:
\[ \text{beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \cdots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.

2. **Checking Initial Order:**
   - The `func_1` function checks if the array is already in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, the beauty is 0 because the sum of differences will be zero.

3. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty:**
   - If the array is not in non-decreasing order, the program sorts the array.
   - It then calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

### Detailed Reasoning
1. **Initial Check with `func_1`:**
   - This check is unnecessary because sorting the array will always yield the maximum possible beauty, regardless of the initial order.
   - If the array is already in non-decreasing order, sorting it again will not change anything, and the beauty will still be zero.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After sorting, the beauty is correctly calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Example Walkthrough
Let's walk through the example provided:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `[2, 1, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Sorted: `[69, 69, 69]`
  - Beauty: `(69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`
  - Sorted: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Beauty: `(54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`
  - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Beauty: `(3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `[2, 1]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2]`
  - Beauty: `(2 - 1) = 1`

### Conclusion
The program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then summing the differences between consecutive elements. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
