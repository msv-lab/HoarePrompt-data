Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the maximum beauty of the array by sorting the array and then computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements. However, the logic used to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order is not correctly implemented. The function `func_1` checks if the array is sorted but does not affect the main logic of calculating the maximum beauty. 

Given the problem statement, the maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This approach works because the difference \(a_i - a_{i-1}\) is maximized when the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
2. **Sorting and Calculating Beauty**: For each test case, the program sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
3. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, the function returns `True`, which is not used in the main logic. If it is not, the function returns `False`, which also is not used in the main logic.

Since the main logic of sorting the array and calculating the beauty is correct, the function `func_1` is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
