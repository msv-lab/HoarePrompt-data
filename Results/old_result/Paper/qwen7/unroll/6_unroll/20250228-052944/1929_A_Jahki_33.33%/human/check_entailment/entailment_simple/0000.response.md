Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the array. The beauty can be maximized by arranging the elements in such a way that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
   - However, this function is not directly relevant to calculating the maximum beauty since the problem does not require checking if the array is sorted. Instead, it should simply sort the array and compute the beauty.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array elements.
   - It then sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic for calculating the beauty is correct if the array is sorted.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - The sorting step ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - The calculation of beauty using the sorted array is correct.

Given the above analysis, the program is correct in its approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
