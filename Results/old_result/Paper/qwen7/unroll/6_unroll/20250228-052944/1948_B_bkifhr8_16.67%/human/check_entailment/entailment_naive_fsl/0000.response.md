Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the array. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
3
12 28 5
```

According to the problem description, we should be able to split `28` into `[2, 8]` and insert these digits back into the array in the correct positions. The correct transformation would result in the array `[2, 8, 5]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order.

However, the provided program does not handle this case correctly. It checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, but it does not properly split and reinsert the digits. Instead, it simply removes and reinserts the digit in a way that does not guarantee the array will become sorted.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly split the element and reinsert the digits in the appropriate positions, ensuring the array remains valid after each operation.
