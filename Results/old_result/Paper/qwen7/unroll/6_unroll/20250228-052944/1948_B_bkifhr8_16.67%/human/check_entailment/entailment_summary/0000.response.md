Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the elements of the array.
3. It then iterates through the array to check if any element greater than 10 exists. If such an element is found, it splits the element into its constituent digits and rearranges the array accordingly.
4. After potentially splitting elements, it calls the function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
5. The function `func_1` correctly sorts the array and checks if the original array matches the sorted array.

However, the key issue with the program is that it does not actually perform the splitting operation correctly. The program attempts to split an element by popping it from the list and inserting the digits back into the list, but it does so in a way that may not maintain the relative order of the elements that were not split. This means the program might not correctly simulate the allowed operations.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach would be to repeatedly split any element greater than 10 until no such elements exist, and then check if the resulting array is sorted. The current implementation does not fully achieve this because it only performs one pass through the array and does not ensure that all elements are processed correctly.

Therefore, the program is not correct as per the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
