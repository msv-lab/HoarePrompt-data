Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a sum based on a specific formula involving \(a\) and \(b\), and prints the result of this sum minus 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input, followed by pairs of integers for each test case. The final output consists of one integer per test case, representing the calculated sum minus 2.**
