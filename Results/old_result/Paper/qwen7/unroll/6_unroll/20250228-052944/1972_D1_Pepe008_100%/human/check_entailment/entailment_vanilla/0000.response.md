Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program attempts to solve this problem but seems to have an incorrect approach. Let's break it down:

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Pairs**:
   - The program uses a loop to iterate from `1` to `b` and calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This does not seem to be related to the problem's constraints.
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is also irrelevant to the problem.

2. **Misunderstanding of Conditions**:
   - The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It does not use the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) in the calculation, which is crucial for the problem.

3. **Redundant and Incorrect Operations**:
   - The program adds `1` to `suma` under certain conditions without properly checking the required conditions of the problem.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
