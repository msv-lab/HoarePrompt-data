Reasoning:
Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The code aims to calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the current implementation uses a different approach which does not directly solve the problem as stated. Instead of calculating the gcd and checking the condition, it attempts to use a formula involving `i` (which seems to be an attempt at a different method).

3. **Formula Used**:
   - The formula used in the code, `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`, does not align with the problem statement. This formula is not derived from the given conditions and does not correctly count the valid pairs `(a, b)`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly in terms of input limits, but the logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the required condition.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
