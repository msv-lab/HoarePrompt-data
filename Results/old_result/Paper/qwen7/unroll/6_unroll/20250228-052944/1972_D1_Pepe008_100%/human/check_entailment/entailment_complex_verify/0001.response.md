### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the given program. Let's review the key points and verify them:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Pairs**:
   - The original program uses a loop to iterate from `1` to `b` and calculates `x` using the formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1`. This does not seem to be related to the problem's constraints.
   - The condition `(a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0` is also irrelevant to the problem.

2. **Misunderstanding of Conditions**:
   - The program does not correctly check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It does not use the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd\)) in the calculation, which is crucial for the problem.

3. **Redundant and Incorrect Operations**:
   - The program adds `1` to `suma` under certain conditions without properly checking the required conditions of the problem.

The original assessment also provides a corrected version of the program, which correctly iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\), calculates \(\gcd(a, b)\), and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the detailed analysis and the provided corrected version, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
