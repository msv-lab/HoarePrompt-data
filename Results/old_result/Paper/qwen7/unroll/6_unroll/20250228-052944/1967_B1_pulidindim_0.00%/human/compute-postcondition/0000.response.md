Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`; n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and their values are yet to be determined.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid after the code execution, but now `t` specifically holds the value of the integer input. The values of `n` and `m` are not affected by this code and remain as integers within the specified range, but their exact values are yet to be determined.
