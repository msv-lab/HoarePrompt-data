You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

After all iterations, the values of `n` and `m` for each iteration are processed to compute `ans` according to the given logic, and then printed as an integer.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) but does not accurately calculate the number of such pairs according to the given conditions.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement: `n = 10`, `m = 8`.

According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's manually verify a few pairs:
- For \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 3\) and \(b = 1\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 4\) and \(b = 1\): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\). Since \(5\) is not a multiple of \(1\), this pair is not valid.
- For \(a = 5\) and \(b = 1\): \(5 + 1 = 6\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\). Since \(6\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 1\): \(6 + 1 = 7\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\). Since \(7\) is not a multiple of \(1\), this pair is not valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 2\): \(6 + 2 = 8\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 4\). Since \(8\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 6\) and \(b = 3\): \(6 + 3 = 9\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 9\). Since \(9\) is a multiple of \(9\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 7\) and \(b = 1\): \(7 + 1 = 8\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\). Since \(8\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 8\) and \(b = 1\): \(8 + 1 = 9\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\). Since \(9\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 9\) and \(b = 1\): \(9 + 1 = 10\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\). Since \(10\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 10\) and \(b = 1\): \(10 + 1 = 11\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\). Since \(11\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\): \(10 + 2 = 12\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 4\). Since \(12\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.

From the manual verification, we can see that the valid pairs are: (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2), (10,3), (10,4), (10,5), (10,6), (10,7), (10,8). This gives us 21 valid pairs, which is not equal to the output of the program for this input.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
