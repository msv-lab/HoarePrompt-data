Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for counting valid pairs \((a, b)\) does not accurately follow the given conditions. Let's break down why it's incorrect and provide a more accurate approach.

#### Issues with the Provided Solution:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The current implementation attempts to increment `ans` based on some arithmetic operations that do not correctly account for the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Logic Flaw**: The while loop and the subsequent calculations do not properly iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition for each pair.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        ans = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(ans)

func()
```

This solution iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) within the specified ranges and checks if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.

Given the constraints, this brute-force approach might be inefficient for very large inputs. However, for the given constraints (where \(n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\)), it should work within acceptable time limits.
