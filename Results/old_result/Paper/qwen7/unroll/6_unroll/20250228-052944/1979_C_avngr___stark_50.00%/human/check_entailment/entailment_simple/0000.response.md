### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This means we need to find a distribution \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \quad \text{for all } i
   \]

2. **Key Insight**: To satisfy the condition, we can set \(x_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\), where \(m\) is the product of all multipliers \(k_i\). This ensures that the total bet is \(m\), and for each outcome \(i\), the winnings would be \(k_i \cdot \frac{m}{k_i} = m\).

3. **GCD Calculation**: The code calculates the GCD of the list of multipliers using the `func_1` function. This step is crucial because it helps in normalizing the values so that the sum of the bets is minimized while still satisfying the condition.

4. **Normalization**: After calculating the GCD, the code divides each element in the list by the GCD. This step ensures that the values are in their simplest form relative to the GCD.

5. **Validation**: The code checks if the sum of the normalized values is less than or equal to the normalized product divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the normalized values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. The GCD calculation helps in finding the smallest possible values that satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It uses the GCD to normalize the values and ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
