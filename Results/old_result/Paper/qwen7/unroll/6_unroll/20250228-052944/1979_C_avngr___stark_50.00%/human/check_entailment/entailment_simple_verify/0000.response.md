### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the example test cases.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Calculate the Product of Multipliers:**
   - Compute the product `m` of all multipliers.
   - This product represents the total amount of coins you would receive if any one of the outcomes were to win.

3. **Calculate Bet Amounts:**
   - For each outcome, calculate the bet amount as `int(m / k[i])`.
   - Store these bet amounts in the list `c`.

4. **Find the GCD of Bet Amounts:**
   - Calculate the GCD of all bet amounts using the `func_1` function.
   - Divide each bet amount by the GCD to simplify the bet amounts.

5. **Check Feasibility:**
   - Check if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the simplified total amount received (`m / hcf`).
   - If true, print the simplified bet amounts.
   - If false, print `-1`.

#### Detailed Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example test case provided:

- **Test Case:**
  - `n = 3`
  - `k = [3, 2, 7]`

1. **Product Calculation:**
   - `m = 3 * 2 * 7 = 42`

2. **Bet Amounts Calculation:**
   - `c = [42 / 3, 42 / 2, 42 / 7] = [14, 21, 6]`

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - `hcf = gcd(14, 21, 6) = 1`
   - Simplified bet amounts: `c = [14, 21, 6]`

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - Sum of bet amounts: `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
   - Simplified total amount received: `42 / 1 = 42`
   - Since `41 < 42`, the condition is satisfied.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the simplified bet amounts: `14 21 6`

This example shows that the program works correctly for this case.

Now, let's consider another example from the problem statement:

- **Test Case:**
  - `n = 2`
  - `k = [3, 3]`

1. **Product Calculation:**
   - `m = 3 * 3 = 9`

2. **Bet Amounts Calculation:**
   - `c = [9 / 3, 9 / 3] = [3, 3]`

3. **GCD Calculation:**
   - `hcf = gcd(3, 3) = 3`
   - Simplified bet amounts: `c = [1, 1]`

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - Sum of bet amounts: `1 + 1 = 2`
   - Simplified total amount received: `9 / 3 = 3`
   - Since `2 < 3`, the condition is satisfied.

5. **Output:**
   - Print the simplified bet amounts: `1 1`

This example also shows that the program works correctly for this case.

Given the analysis above, the original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the cases correctly, and the logic used to find the GCD and simplify the bet amounts ensures that the sum of the bet amounts is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
