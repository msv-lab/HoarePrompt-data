Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - `func_1` is designed to handle a single binary string and calculates the sum of lengths of segments of consecutive 1's plus the length of each segment. This is not the same as finding the minimum cost to sort the string with cyclic shifts.
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case, but `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for sorting the string through cyclic shifts.
3. The provided functions do not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts or the optimal way to sort the string. They simply count the lengths of segments of consecutive 1's, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
