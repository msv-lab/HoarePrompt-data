Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: 
   - Function `func_1` is designed to process a list of integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
   - It calculates the total count of 1s in the list, including the length of each segment of consecutive 1s.
   - This function does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it does not account for cyclic shifts or the cost associated with them. Instead, it simply counts the number of 1s and their segments, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort the string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - Function `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, which, as explained, does not solve the problem correctly.
   - Since `func_1` does not implement the logic required to solve the problem, `func_2` also fails to provide the correct solution.

3. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The provided functions do not implement this logic at all.

Given the analysis, both `func_1` and `func_2` fail to address the problem requirements and do not provide a correct solution. Therefore, the program as provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
