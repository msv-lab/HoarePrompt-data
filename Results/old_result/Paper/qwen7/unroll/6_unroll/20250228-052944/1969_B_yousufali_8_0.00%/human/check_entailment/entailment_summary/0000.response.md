Reasoning:
The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings. The given code, however, does not implement the logic to solve this problem. Instead, `func_1` simply counts the number of '1's in a list of integers, which is not relevant to the problem at hand. `func_2` calls `func_1` for each test case, which means it will not correctly compute the required minimum cost for making the binary string sorted.

Since the provided functions do not implement the logic needed to solve the problem, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
