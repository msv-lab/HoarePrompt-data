You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), and lists \( a \) and \( b \). It then calculates and prints the number of times the sum of certain values in a dictionary \( D \) is greater than or equal to \( k \) after performing specific operations on the elements of lists \( a \) and \( b \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` based on the given problem description. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes counters for the elements in the first `m` elements of `a` (`cnt_aa`) and the elements in `b` (`cnt_bb`). It also calculates the intersection (`D`), difference from `cnt_aa` to `D` (`E`), and difference from `cnt_bb` to `D` (`C`).

2. **Initial Check**: It checks if the initial count of common elements (`tot`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it increments the count of good subsegments (`fnd`).

3. **Sliding Window**: The program uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent subsegments of length `m` in `a`. For each new element entering the window and the element leaving the window, it updates the counters `D`, `E`, and `C` accordingly. It then checks if the updated count of common elements (`tot`) is greater than or equal to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases by updating the counters correctly and ensuring that the count of good subsegments is incremented only when the condition is met.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly counts the number of good subsegments for any valid input within the constraints provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
