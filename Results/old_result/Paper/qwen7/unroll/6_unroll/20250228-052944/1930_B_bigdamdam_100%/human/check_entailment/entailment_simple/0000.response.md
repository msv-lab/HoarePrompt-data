Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to construct a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \). 

Here's a breakdown of the logic used in the code:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes an empty list `p` of length `n`.
2. **Filling Even Indices**: It fills the even indices of `p` with values starting from `n` and decrementing by 2. This ensures that the values at even indices are large and unlikely to divide smaller values.
3. **Filling Odd Indices**: It fills the odd indices of `p` with values starting from 1 plus the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 and incrementing by 2. This ensures that the values at odd indices are small and less likely to divide larger values.

Let's analyze whether this approach meets the problem requirements:

- **Even Indices**: Values are set as \( n, n-2, n-4, \ldots, 2 \) (if `n` is even) or \( n, n-2, n-4, \ldots, 3 \) (if `n` is odd).
- **Odd Indices**: Values are set as \( 1 + (n \mod 2), 3 + (n \mod 2), 5 + (n \mod 2), \ldots \).

Given these assignments, let's consider possible pairs \((i, j)\):

- For even indices, the values are large, making it highly unlikely for an even index value to divide another even index value.
- For odd indices, the values are small, making it unlikely for an odd index value to divide another odd index value.

However, the critical check is whether an even-indexed value can divide an odd-indexed value or vice versa. Given the construction, the even-indexed values are always larger than the odd-indexed values, so they cannot divide each other. Similarly, the odd-indexed values are constructed in a way that they are unlikely to divide even-indexed values due to their relative sizes.

Thus, the constructed permutation satisfies the condition that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Therefore, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
