Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of `a` and `b`. Hereâ€™s why it works:

- If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, then Bob will always win. This is because after each full cycle of moves (where both players make one move each), the total number of coins remains unchanged modulo 2. Therefore, if the initial sum is even, Bob will always be the one to make the last move when the total number of coins becomes zero.
- If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, then Alice will always win. Similarly, since the parity changes with each full cycle, if the initial sum is odd, Alice will be the one to make the last move when the total number of coins becomes zero.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the solution is correct.
