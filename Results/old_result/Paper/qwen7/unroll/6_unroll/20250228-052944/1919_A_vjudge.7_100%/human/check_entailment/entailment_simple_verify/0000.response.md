### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program to understand why the original assessment is incorrect.

#### Problem Analysis:
1. **Game Rules**: 
   - Players take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The player who can force the opponent into a losing position wins.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position by removing one coin from their own wallet and then swapping wallets. This leaves the opponent with an odd number of coins, ensuring the opponent will eventually be forced to make the last move when they have 1 coin left.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is even, the player whose turn it is can always win by forcing the opponent into a situation where they have 1 coin left.
   - If the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd, the player whose turn it is will eventually be forced into a situation where they have 1 coin left and lose.

#### Program Analysis:
The provided program correctly checks if the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd and prints the appropriate result:
```python
if a + b & 1 == 0:
    print('Bob')
else:
    print('Alice')
```
This logic aligns perfectly with the winning conditions described above. Here's why:

- If `a + b` is even, the player whose turn it is can always force the opponent into a losing position.
- If `a + b` is odd, the player whose turn it is will eventually be forced into a losing position.

Given the problem description and the optimal strategy, the program's logic is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect. The program correctly implements the logic based on the sum of the coins being even or odd, which determines the winner according to the optimal strategy.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the optimal strategy.
