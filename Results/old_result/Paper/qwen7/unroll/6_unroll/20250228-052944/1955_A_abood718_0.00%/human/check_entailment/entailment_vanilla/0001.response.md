Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion vs Regular Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the regular price of two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper, so the total cost is `A * B`.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is even.
     - In this case, the program calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)` which is the cost of buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts:**
   - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means the number of yogurts `A` is odd.
     - The program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then adds `B` without calculating the actual cost.
     - It should calculate the cost as `X * C + B` to account for the remaining single yogurt bought at the regular price.

### Correct Implementation:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that when the number of yogurts is odd, the program correctly calculates the cost as `X * C + B`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical error in handling the case when the number of yogurts is odd. It should correctly calculate the cost as `X * C + B` instead of just printing `X`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
