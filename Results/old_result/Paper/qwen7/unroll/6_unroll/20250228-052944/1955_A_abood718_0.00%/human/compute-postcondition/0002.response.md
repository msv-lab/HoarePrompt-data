Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each line containing the result of one of the conditions in the loop. Specifically, for each iteration \(i\):

- If \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\).
- If \(A\) is even and \(B \times 2 \geq C\), the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
- Otherwise, the output will be two lines: \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) and \(X \times C + B\).

The total number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by `int(input())`.
