Reasoning:

The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost of buying \(n\) yogurts under the given conditions. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `if B * 2 < C` checks whether it is cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotional price (`C`) compared to buying them individually at the regular price (`B`).
   - The condition `elif A % 2 == 0` checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
   - The final `else` block handles the case when `A` is odd.

2. **Correct Logic**:
   - If \(2b < c\), it means buying two yogurts for \(c\) is cheaper than buying them individually at \(b\). In this case, we should buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buy the remaining yogurts individually.
   - If \(2b \geq c\), it means buying two yogurts for \(c\) is not cheaper than buying them individually at \(b\). In this case, we should just buy each yogurt individually.

3. **Implementation Issues**:
   - The code incorrectly prints `X = A // 2` and `X * C + B` in the `else` block. This is not necessary and does not correctly calculate the minimum cost.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought and then handling the remaining individual yogurts.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `pairs = A // 2`.
   - Calculate the cost of these pairs: `cost_pairs = pairs * C`.
   - Calculate the remaining individual yogurts: `remaining = A % 2`.
   - Calculate the cost of the remaining individual yogurts: `cost_remaining = remaining * B`.
   - The total cost is then `total_cost = cost_pairs + cost_remaining`.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic for calculating the minimum cost. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
