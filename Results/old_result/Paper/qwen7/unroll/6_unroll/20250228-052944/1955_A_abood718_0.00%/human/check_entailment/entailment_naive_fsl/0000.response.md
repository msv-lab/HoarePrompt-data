Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually, especially when the total number of yogurts is odd. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3 5 11
```
- According to the problem description, it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts for 15 burles (since 11 * 1.5 = 16.5, which is greater than 15).
- However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `X * C + B`, where `X` is the integer division of `A` by 2, leading to a cost of 11 + 5 = 16, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should calculate the minimum cost by considering both the individual purchase and the promotion purchase options. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b * 2 < a * 2:
            # Calculate the cost using the promotion
            full_sets = n // 2
            remaining = n % 2
            cost = full_sets * b + remaining * a
        else:
            # Calculate the cost without promotion
            cost = n * a
        print(cost)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly by comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually versus in pairs.
