Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines printed during the execution of the loop. For each iteration \(i\), the program reads three integers \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) from the input. Based on the conditions provided in the loop body, it prints one or two values for each iteration. Specifically:

- If \(B \times 2 < C\), it prints \(A \times B\).
- If \(A\) is even, it prints \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
- Otherwise, it first prints \(X = \frac{A}{2}\) (integer division), then prints \(X \times C + B\).

The exact output depends on the specific values of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) for each test case. Since the number of test cases \(t\) is given as an input, the output will contain \(t\) lines, each representing the output of one iteration of the loop.
