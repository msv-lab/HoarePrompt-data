Reasoning:

Let's analyze the logic of the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Price Comparison**:
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`2 * B`).
     - If `2 * B < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them individually at the regular price.
     - In this case, the program prints `A * B`, which is incorrect because it should be `A * C / 2` (the cost of buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is even and `2 * B >= C`, the program correctly calculates the cost as `A * C / 2` (buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price).

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is odd, the program divides `A` into two parts: `X = A // 2` (integer division, so `X` is the largest even number less than or equal to `A`), and then calculates the cost as `X * C + B` (buying `X` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price and one yogurt at the regular price).
   - This part of the logic is correct.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the issue lies in the condition where `2 * B < C`. The program incorrectly prints `A * B` instead of `A * C / 2`.

Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
