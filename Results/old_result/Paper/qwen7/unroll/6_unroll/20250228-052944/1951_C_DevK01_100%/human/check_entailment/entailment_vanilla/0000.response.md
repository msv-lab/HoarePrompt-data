Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line.
   - It then reads the list of ticket prices `M` for `n` days.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` because you can't buy more tickets than `k` even if `m` is larger.
   - It sorts the list `M` to process the days with the lowest prices first.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - `q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`: This calculates how many full days we need to buy tickets considering the maximum tickets that can be bought per day (`m`).
   - `N = M[:q]`: This extracts the first `q` days' prices.
   - `n = len(N)`: This gets the number of days considered so far.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means we can buy all required tickets in full days without needing to buy any tickets on a partial day.
     - `cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`: This calculates the total cost considering the initial prices and the penalty for buying tickets on subsequent days.
   - Otherwise, it needs to buy some tickets on a partial day:
     - `w = N.pop()`: This removes the last price from the list of days.
     - `mu = k - (n - 1) * m`: This calculates the number of additional tickets to buy on the last day.
     - `cost = mu * w`: This calculates the cost for the additional tickets.
     - `cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu`: This adds the cost for the initial days and the additional tickets.

5. **Output:**
   - The calculated cost is printed for each test case.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, let's check if the logic matches the problem statement and examples:

- The logic correctly handles the scenario where the number of tickets can be bought in full days.
- The logic also correctly handles the scenario where tickets need to be bought on a partial day.
- The sorting and splitting of days ensure that the lowest prices are used first, which aligns with the problem requirement to minimize cost.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should work as expected for the given constraints and examples.

**Correctness:** **True**
