Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each iteration of the loop, `t` items are processed. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and each `cost` calculated for each iteration is printed. The other variables (`L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`) are reset for each iteration and do not affect the final state of `t`.
