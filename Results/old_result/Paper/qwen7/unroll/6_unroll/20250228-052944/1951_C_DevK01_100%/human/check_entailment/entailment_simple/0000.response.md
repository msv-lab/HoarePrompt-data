Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `a`.

2. **Sorting and Calculation**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `M`.
   - It calculates `q` as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `k / m` using `math.ceil`.
   - It then takes the first `q` elements of the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If `n * m == k`, it calculates the cost directly by summing the prices of the tickets purchased and adding the additional cost due to the increase in price.
   - Otherwise, it handles the case where the number of tickets purchased exceeds `n * m` by breaking down the calculation into parts.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where the number of tickets to be purchased is exactly `n * m` or when the number of tickets to be purchased is less than `n * m`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the provided solution appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
