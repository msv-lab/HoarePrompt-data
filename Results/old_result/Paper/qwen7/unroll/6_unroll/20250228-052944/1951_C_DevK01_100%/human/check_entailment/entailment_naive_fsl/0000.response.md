Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be purchased `k` exceeds the product of the number of days `n` and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day `m`. Specifically, the program assumes that `m` is the minimum between `m` and `k`, which is not always correct. The program also does not properly account for the increase in ticket prices after purchasing tickets on a given day.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5 2 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program's output would be:
```
10
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
10
```

But let's consider another case:
```
3
5 2 6
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program's output would be:
```
10
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
11
```

This is because the program incorrectly handles the scenario where `k` exceeds `n * m`. In this case, the program should consider purchasing tickets in such a way that the total cost is minimized, but it fails to do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
