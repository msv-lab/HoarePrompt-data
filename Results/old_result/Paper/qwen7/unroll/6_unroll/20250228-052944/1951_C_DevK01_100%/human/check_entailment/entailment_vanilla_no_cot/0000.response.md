To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step.

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the array `M` representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Setting Up Variables:**
   - It sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` because the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day cannot exceed `m`.
   - It sorts the array `M` to facilitate the calculation of the minimum cost.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Cost:**
   - It calculates the number of batches (`q`) of tickets that can be bought in the first `q` days.
   - It then determines the cost based on the number of tickets bought in the first batch and the remaining tickets.

### Detailed Verification

Let's go through the logic in detail:

- **Sorting the Prices:**
  - Sorting the prices ensures that the cheapest days are considered first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

- **Batch Calculation:**
  - The variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`. This means it determines how many full batches of `m` tickets can be bought initially.
  - If `n * m == k`, it means all tickets can be bought in full batches without any remainder, and the cost is calculated accordingly.

- **Handling Remaining Tickets:**
  - If there are remaining tickets after the initial full batches, the program correctly calculates the cost for these remaining tickets.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost is calculated by considering the cost of buying tickets in full batches and the additional cost due to the increase in ticket prices.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`
   - Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Sorting: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - `q = ceil(3 / 2) = 2`
   - First batch: `2 * (2 + 4) = 12`
   - Second batch: `1 * (6 + 8) = 14`
   - Total cost: `12 + 14 = 26` (but the correct answer is 10, so this part needs correction)

2. **Example 2:**
   - `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`
   - Prices: `[8, 6, 4, 2]`
   - Sorting: `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
   - `q = ceil(8 / 2) = 4`
   - Total cost: `8 * (2 + 4 + 6 + 8) = 160` (but the correct answer is 64, so this part needs correction)

### Conclusion

Upon closer inspection, the provided solution seems to have logical errors in handling the remaining tickets and the cost calculation. Specifically, the cost calculation for the remaining tickets is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer

**Correctness: False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given constraints.
