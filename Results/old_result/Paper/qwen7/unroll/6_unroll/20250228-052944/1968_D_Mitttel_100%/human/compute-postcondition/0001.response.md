Output State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the duration of the game.**

The code initializes the variable `mx` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
