You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

It checks if the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and if the sum of `extroverts % 3` and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3.

Otherwise, it returns `None`, indicating it is impossible to accommodate them under the specified conditions.

    #The program returns `introverts` plus the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)` if `func_1(extroverts, universals)` does not return `None`; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, all of which are non-negative integers. It calls another function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`. If `func_1(extroverts, universals)` returns a value other than `None`, the function returns the sum of `introverts` and the returned value from `func_1`. Otherwise, it returns `-1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)

According to the problem description:
- 1 introvert requires 1 tent.
- 4 extroverts need to be paired, but since there is only 1 universal, this is impossible because 3 extroverts cannot find a third person to share a tent with.

The program should return `-1` for this case, but it does not handle this scenario correctly. Here's a breakdown of why the current implementation fails:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts modulo 3 is not zero.
   - If `extroverts % 3` is not zero, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals` is less than 3. If so, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to pair all extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses `func_1` to calculate the total number of tents needed.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

However, `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. For the input `1 4 1`, `func_1` would incorrectly return a value instead of `-1`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the specific case where the number of extroverts exceeds the available pairs.
