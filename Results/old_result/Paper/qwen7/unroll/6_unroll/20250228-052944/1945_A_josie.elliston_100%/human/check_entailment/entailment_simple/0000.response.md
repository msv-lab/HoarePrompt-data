Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 is not zero, it checks whether adding the number of universals can make the total number of people divisible by 3. If not, it returns `None`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals under the given conditions.
   - If the condition is met, it calculates the minimum number of tents required using the formula `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`. This formula correctly accounts for the fact that each tent can hold either 3 people (if there are enough universals) or fewer if not all extroverts can find a suitable tent.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` calls `func_1` with the parameters `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result of `func_1`, which correctly accounts for the tents needed for introverts who need individual tents.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` with the appropriate parameters and printing the result.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem statement and correctly handles all edge cases.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
