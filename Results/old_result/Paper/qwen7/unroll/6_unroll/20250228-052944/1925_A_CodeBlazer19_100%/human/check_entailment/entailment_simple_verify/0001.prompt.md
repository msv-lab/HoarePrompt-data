You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k] * n)
        
    #State: Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each containing a string of length `n*k` made up of the first `k` letters of the alphabet ('a' to 'z'). The number of such lines is equal to the value of `t`. Each line is generated based on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The string `s` should have the smallest possible length among all valid solutions.
   - If there are multiple valid strings of the same length, any one of them can be printed.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then prints a string consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets repeated `n` times.

3. **Checking the Solution's Validity:**
   - Consider the example test cases provided:
     - For `n=1` and `k=2`, the output is "ab". This is correct because both 'a' and 'b' are subsequences of "ab".
     - For `n=2` and `k=1`, the output is "aa". This is correct because the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 alphabet ('a') is "aa", and it is a subsequence of "aa".
     - For `n=2` and `k=2`, the output is "baab". This is correct because all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets ('a' and 'b') are subsequences of "baab" (e.g., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb").
     - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output is "abcbac". This is correct because all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') are subsequences of "abcbac" (e.g., "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc").

4. **Ensuring Correctness:**
   - The solution generates a string that is at least as long as necessary to contain all subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - The generated string is minimal in length because repeating the first `k` alphabets `n` times ensures that all subsequences of length `n` are covered.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or `k` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles cases where `n` and `k` are larger, ensuring that all required subsequences are included.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
