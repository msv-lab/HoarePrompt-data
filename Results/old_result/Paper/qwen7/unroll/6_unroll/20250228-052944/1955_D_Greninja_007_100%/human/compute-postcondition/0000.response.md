Output State: **`cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, and `k` is an integer.**

Explanation: The code `cb = Counter(sorted(b))` creates a `Counter` object named `cb` that contains the counts of each unique element in the list `b` after sorting it. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
