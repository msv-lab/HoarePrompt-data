Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, followed by the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case. It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the number of good subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` elements from array `b`.

3. **Counter Initialization**: 
   - `cb` is initialized as a counter for the sorted elements of array `b`.
   - `ca` is initialized as a counter for the sorted elements of the first `m` elements of array `a`.

4. **Initial Good Subsegment Check**:
   - The initial segment of `a` of length `m` is checked to see if it contains at least `k` elements from `b`. This is done using the intersection of counters (`ca & cb`) and checking the sum of the values in this intersection.

5. **Sliding Window**:
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsequent subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element added to the window (element `a[r]`), it increments the corresponding count in `ca`.
   - For each element removed from the window (element `a[r - m]`), it decrements the corresponding count in `ca`.
   - It updates the sum of matching elements (`sm`) accordingly.
   - If the updated sum of matching elements (`sm`) is at least `k`, it increments the answer (`ans`).

6. **Output**: The function returns the total count of good subsegments for each test case.

Given the logic and implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of good subsegments for each test case based on the provided problem description.

Correctness: **True**
