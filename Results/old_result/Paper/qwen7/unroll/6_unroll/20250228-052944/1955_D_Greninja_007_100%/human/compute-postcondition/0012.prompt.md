You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, a is a list of n integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and b is a list of m integers where each element is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func_1(n, m, k, a, b):
    cb = Counter(sorted(b))
    ca = Counter(sorted(a[:m]))
    ans = 0
    sm = sum((ca & cb).values())
    if (sm >= k) :
        ans += 1
    #State: `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb`; `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `a[:m]`; if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to 1.
    for r in range(m, n):
        if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]:
            sm += 1
        
        ca[a[r]] += 1
        
        if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]:
            sm -= 1
        
        ca[a[r - m]] -= 1
        
        if sm >= k:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `sm` is the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` after all iterations; `cb` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `b`; `n` is an integer; `m` is an integer; `k` is an integer; `ca` is a Counter object containing the counts of elements in the sorted list `a[:n]` after all iterations; if `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to the number of times `sm` reached or exceeded `k` during the loop iterations.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is set to the number of times sm reached or exceeded k during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, m, and k (all integers with specific constraints), and two lists a and b. It returns the count of times the sum of elements from list a up to index m-1 and list b up to index k-1 reaches or exceeds k.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns ans which is set to the number of times sm reached or exceeded k during the loop iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
