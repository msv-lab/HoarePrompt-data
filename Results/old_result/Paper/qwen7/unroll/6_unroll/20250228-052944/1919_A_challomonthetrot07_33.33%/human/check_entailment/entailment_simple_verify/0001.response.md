### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading pairs of integers `(a, b)` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets respectively.

2. **Conditions and Outputs:**
   - The program checks several conditions to determine the winner:
     - If `a == b`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a == 1`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `b == 1`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`, it prints 'Alice'.
     - If `a > b`, it prints 'Bob'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Key Observations:
- **Turn-Based Game:** Each player alternates moves, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
- **Exchange and Removal:** Players can either exchange wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
- **Winning Strategy:** The key is to force the opponent into a position where they cannot make a valid move.

#### Analyzing Conditions:

1. **Equal Coins (`a == b`):**
   - If both players have the same number of coins, the next player can always mirror the previous player's move, leading to a draw if both play optimally. However, since the problem states that the player who cannot make a move loses, the player who starts (Alice) will lose because Bob can always mirror her moves. Thus, printing 'Bob' is correct.

2. **Single Coin (`a == 1` or `b == 1`):**
   - If one player has only one coin, the other player can always force them to lose by removing the last coin and not swapping. Therefore, printing 'Alice' when `a == 1` and 'Bob' when `b == 1` is correct.

3. **Odd Number of Coins (`a % 2 == 1`):**
   - If `a` is odd, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and not swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Bob' when `a % 2 == 1` is correct.

4. **Even Number of Coins and Odd Number of Coins (`a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`):**
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Alice' when `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1` is correct.

5. **More Coins in One Wallet (`a > b`):**
   - If `a > b`, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Thus, printing 'Bob' when `a > b` is correct.

6. **Otherwise:**
   - The remaining condition covers all other cases. However, the program does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. For example, consider the case where `a = 2` and `b = 2`. According to the given logic, the program would print 'Bob', but in reality, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing one coin and swapping, ensuring Bob will eventually be left with zero coins. Therefore, the program should print 'Alice' in this case.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the conditions and their implications, we find that the program does not cover all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, the condition `a > b` does not account for the optimal strategy when both players have an even number of coins.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly, particularly when both players have an even number of coins.
