Output State: The output will consist of T lines, each line containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The specific output on each line depends on the values of `a` and `b` provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. If `a` equals `b`, it prints 'Bob'. If `a` is 1, it prints 'Alice'. If `b` is 1, it prints 'Bob'. If `a` is odd, it prints 'Bob'. If `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints 'Bob', otherwise it prints 'Alice'.
