Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Alice' or 'Bob', depending on the input values for `a` and `b` in each iteration of the loop. Specifically, the output will be determined by the conditions inside the loop, which compare the values of `a` and `b`. Each line of output corresponds to one pair of inputs `(a, b)` provided by the user for each iteration from 0 to T-1.
