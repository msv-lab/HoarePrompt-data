The function processes `t` input strings, each of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints 'A' if the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B' in any string, otherwise it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each string.
