Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that both `l` and `r` are subsets of `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` and `[a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}]` respectively. Instead, it only checks for consecutive duplicates in `lft` and `rgt`, which does not guarantee that the selected elements form valid subsets.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 2
1 2 3 4 3 2 1 4
```

The program will output:

```
2 2 3 3
4 4 1 1
```

However, this is incorrect because `2 2 3 3` is not a subset of `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and `4 4 1 1` is not a subset of `[3, 4, 1, 2]`. The correct approach would involve selecting elements from both halves of the array to ensure the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` equals the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

A correct solution would involve a more systematic approach to ensure that the selected elements from both halves of the array form valid subsets and satisfy the required bitwise XOR condition.
