Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left part of the list followed by single elements, or pairs of the same element followed by single elements from the right part of the list, ensuring that the total number of printed elements does not exceed `k`. If there are not enough unique or duplicate elements to form pairs, the remaining elements will be printed individually. The process is repeated for each test case defined by `T`.
