State: **`T` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 5000, _ is now 1**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used in the loop, but it is typically an underscore indicating that the value itself is not used within the loop body. However, for the loop to execute, the condition `1 ≤ T ≤ 5000` must be satisfied.
- The loop runs for `T` iterations, starting from `_ = 1` up to `_ = T`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `T` must be a positive integer within the specified range, and the loop counter `_` should start at 1.
