Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding two arrays `l` and `r` each of length \(2k\) such that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
2. The provided solution sorts the first half (`lft`) and the second half (`rgt`) of the input list.
3. It then tries to form the arrays `l` and `r` using repeated elements from `lft` and single elements from both `lft` and `rgt`.
4. The logic for forming `l` and `r` ensures that the XOR condition is met by leveraging the properties of XOR (i.e., \(a \oplus a = 0\) and \(a \oplus 0 = a\)).
5. The solution correctly handles the case where elements are repeated in `lft` by pairing them, and it uses single elements from both halves to meet the required length of \(2k\).
6. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution should work for all valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
