You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program: 
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and for each test case, a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list.
def func():
    for line in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        print(len((tokens := line.split())) - len({*tokens}))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and for each test case, a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is given where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice in the list. After executing the loop, for each test case, the variable `result` holds the number of duplicate tokens in each line of input, where duplicates are counted based on the number of occurrences minus the number of unique tokens.
    #
    #In simpler terms, for each test case, the loop processes every second line starting from the third line of input (skipping the first two lines). It calculates how many tokens are repeated in each line by comparing the length of the split tokens with the length of the set of those tokens. The result for each line is printed but not stored elsewhere, so the final state retains the original lists of integers without any changes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. Nene always tries to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input (stdin) and processes it.
   - The loop iterates over every other line starting from the third line (i.e., lines 3, 5, 7, etc.). This is indicated by `[2::2]` in the list comprehension.
   - For each line, the code splits the line into tokens using `split()`, counts the number of tokens, and then calculates the length of the set of tokens.
   - The result is printed as `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Given the problem context, the expected behavior would involve counting the unique numbers in the input and comparing it to the total count to determine the number of points you can get.
   - However, the current implementation simply counts the number of unique cards in each hand and prints the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards.

4. **Incorrectness**:
   - The given solution does not account for the strategic aspect of the game where Nene tries to minimize your score.
   - The solution does not simulate the game or consider the optimal moves for either player.
   - The solution does not handle the dynamic nature of the game where cards are being placed on the table and points are awarded based on the presence of matching cards.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:
