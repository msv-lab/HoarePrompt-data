### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against Nene. Nene always tries to maximize her score while minimizing yours.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input (stdin) and processes it.
   - The loop iterates over every other line starting from the third line (i.e., lines 3, 5, 7, etc.). This is indicated by `[2::2]` in the list comprehension.
   - For each line, the code splits the line into tokens using `split()`, counts the number of tokens, and then calculates the length of the set of tokens.
   - The result is printed as `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})`.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - Given the problem context, the expected behavior would involve counting the unique numbers in the input and comparing it to the total count to determine the number of points you can get.
   - However, the current implementation simply counts the number of unique cards in each hand and prints the difference between the total number of cards and the number of unique cards.

4. **Incorrectness**:
   - The given solution does not account for the strategic aspect of the game where Nene tries to minimize your score.
   - The solution does not simulate the game or consider the optimal moves for either player.
   - The solution does not handle the dynamic nature of the game where cards are being placed on the table and points are awarded based on the presence of matching cards.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
