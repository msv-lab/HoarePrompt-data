Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter.
   - However, since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the Input and Conditions for the Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`.
   - The input is expected to be an integer `t` such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop will run for `t` iterations, we need to ensure that the input `t` is within the specified range.
   - We also need to ensure that the loop can execute `t` times, which means `t` must be a valid integer in the range `[1, 10^4]`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
