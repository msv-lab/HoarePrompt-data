Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through test cases where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and for each test case, n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and is even. Each test case consists of two strings of length n, both containing only '<' and/or '>' characters. The function returns a result based on the comparison of these two strings for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with specific constraints on the values of `t` and `n`, and process strings of specified lengths containing only '<' and '>'. The exact nature of the return value (e.g., whether it's a boolean, a string, or another type of data) is not specified here, but it will depend on the comparison logic applied to the two strings within each test case.
