Output State: The output state consists of "Yes" or "No" printed for each test case based on the condition `if b[n - 2] == '<':`. If the character at position `n-2` in the string `b` is `<`, it prints "No"; otherwise, it prints "Yes". The number of "Yes" and "No" outputs depends on the input data for each test case.
