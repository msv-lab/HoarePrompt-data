Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of specific substrings ("map", "pie", and "mapie") in the input string and using these counts to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful. However, this approach is flawed because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The formula `x + y - z` does not correctly determine the minimum number of deletions needed to eliminate all instances of "map" and "pie". Instead, it simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and subtracts the overlapping count of "mapie". This does not account for the necessary deletions to remove all instances of "map" and "pie" independently.

2. **Overlap Handling**: The program does not handle overlapping instances of "map" and "pie" correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the program would count "map" twice and "pie" once, but it should only count the total deletions needed to remove all "map" and "pie" instances.

3. **Suboptimal Solution**: The program does not ensure that the minimum number of deletions is achieved. It merely counts occurrences without considering the optimal sequence of deletions.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
