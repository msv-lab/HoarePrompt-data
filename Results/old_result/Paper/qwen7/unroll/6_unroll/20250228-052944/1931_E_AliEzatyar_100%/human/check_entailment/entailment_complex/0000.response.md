Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: The function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of each integer in the list. This is crucial for determining how many zeros are at the end of each number, which affects the total digit count after reversing Anna's moves.

2. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - **Total Digits Calculation**: The program calculates the total number of digits in the list before any reversals (`total_digits`).
   - **Zeros Counting**: It counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using `func_1` and stores these counts in the `zeros` list.
   - **Optimal Play Consideration**: The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order and iteratively subtracts pairs of the largest zeros counts. This simulates the optimal play scenario where Anna tries to minimize the total digits, and Sasha tries to maximize it.
   - **Win Condition Check**: The program checks if the absolute difference between the total digits and the sum of the subtracted zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that the logic works within the given limits.
   - The function `func_1` handles edge cases like numbers with only zeros or no zeros appropriately.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic accurately reflects the game rules and the optimal play strategy.
   - The implementation correctly processes each test case and outputs the winner based on the given conditions.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the game rules and optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
