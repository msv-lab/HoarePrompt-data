Output State: **`counter` is 0**

The initial state defines that `num` is a list of integers, each between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, and its length `n` satisfies \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\). Additionally, the sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\), and there is a parameter `m` for each test case such that \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).

The given code snippet initializes the variable `counter` to 0. No other operations are performed on `num` or any other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `counter` is set to 0. All other conditions and values related to `num` remain unchanged.
