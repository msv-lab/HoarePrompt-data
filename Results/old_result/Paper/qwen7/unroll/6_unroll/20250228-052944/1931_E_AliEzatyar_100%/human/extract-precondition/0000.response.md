Precondition: **num is a list of integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length of the list n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and there is a parameter m for each test case such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**
