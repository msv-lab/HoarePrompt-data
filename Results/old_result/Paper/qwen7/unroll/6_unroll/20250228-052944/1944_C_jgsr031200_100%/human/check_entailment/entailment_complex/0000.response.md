Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play a game on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the logic for determining the optimal MEX value. Instead, it seems to be implementing a different algorithm that does not align with the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the input array `arr` and print an integer based on certain conditions, but these conditions do not reflect the actual game logic.
   - The function does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob or calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob make their moves according to the rules.
   - Alice will always pick an element from `a` and append it to `c`, then remove it from `a`.
   - Bob will always pick an element from `a` and remove it without appending it to `c`.
   - After all elements are removed, the MEX of the array `c` should be calculated.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of the array `c` as required by the problem statement.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
