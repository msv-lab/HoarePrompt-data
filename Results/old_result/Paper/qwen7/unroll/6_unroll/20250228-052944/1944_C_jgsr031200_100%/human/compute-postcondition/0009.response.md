Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and returns nothing. It counts the frequency of each integer in `arr` and prints an integer `i` (where \(0 \le i < n\)) if `i` appears exactly once in `arr` and there are fewer than two such integers. If there are two or more such integers, it prints the first one found. If no such integer exists, it prints nothing.**
