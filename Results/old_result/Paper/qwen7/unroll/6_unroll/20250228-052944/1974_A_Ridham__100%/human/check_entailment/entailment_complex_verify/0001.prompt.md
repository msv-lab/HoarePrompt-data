You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #This is printed: a series of integers, each on a new line, derived from the loop conditions based on `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)). For each test case, it reads pairs of integers \( x \) and \( y \) (where \( 0 \leq x, y \leq 99 \)), calculates the required screen space based on certain conditions, and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - `space_x = x * 1`: This calculates the total space required for `x` 1x1 icons.
   - `space_y = y * 4`: This calculates the total space required for `y` 2x2 icons, where each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - `total_space = space_y + space_x`: This calculates the total space required for all icons combined.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - `screen_require_for_y = y // 2`: This calculates the minimum number of screens required for 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (since 2x2 icons occupy 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells).
   - If `y` is odd, an additional screen is needed to accommodate the last 2x2 icon, hence `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1`.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`: This calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.

5. **Checking Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons on the same screens as the 2x2 icons.
   - Otherwise, additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `extra_screen = (space_x - remaining_cells) // 15 + 1`.

6. **Result Construction:**
   - The final number of screens required is `extra_screen + screen_require_for_y` if additional screens are needed, otherwise just `screen_require_for_y`.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:** 
  - Input: `1 1`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`
  - `space_x = 1`, `space_y = 4`
  - `total_space = 5`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 1 // 2 + 1 = 1`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 1 - 4 = 11`
  - `space_x = 1 <= 11`, so no additional screen needed.
  - Result: `1`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `7 2`
  - `x = 7`, `y = 2`
  - `space_x = 7`, `space_y = 8`
  - `total_space = 15`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 2 // 2 + 1 = 2`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 2 - 8 = 22`
  - `space_x = 7 <= 22`, so no additional screen needed.
  - Result: `2`

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `12 4`
  - `x = 12`, `y = 4`
  - `space_x = 12`, `space_y = 16`
  - `total_space = 28`
  - `screen_require_for_y = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3`
  - `remaining_cells = 15 * 3 - 16 = 29`
  - `space_x = 12 <= 29`, so no additional screen needed.
  - Result: `3`

From these examples, we can see that the program logic matches the expected results.
