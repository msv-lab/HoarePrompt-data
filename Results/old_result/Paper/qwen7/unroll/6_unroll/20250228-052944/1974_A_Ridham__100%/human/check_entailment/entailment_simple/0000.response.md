Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly calculates the space required for `y` (number of 2x2 icons) and `x` (number of 1x1 icons).
3. The calculation of `screen_require_for_y` is correct because it accounts for the number of screens needed to fit all 2x2 icons, rounding up when necessary.
4. The calculation of `remaining_cells` is also correct as it calculates the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
5. The logic to determine the number of additional screens needed to fit the 1x1 icons (`extra_screen`) is correct. It checks if the remaining cells are sufficient to fit the 1x1 icons without needing an additional screen and calculates the number of additional screens required if not.
6. The final result is stored in the `result` list and printed correctly at the end.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
