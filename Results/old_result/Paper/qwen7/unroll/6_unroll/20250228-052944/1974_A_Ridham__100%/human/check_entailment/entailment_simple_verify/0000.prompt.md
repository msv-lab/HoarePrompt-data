You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Specifically, the calculation of `remaining_cells` and the logic to determine the additional screens needed are flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
- \( x = 12 \)
- \( y = 4 \)

According to the problem description, we need to fit 12 icons of size 1x1 and 4 icons of size 2x2 on the minimum number of screens. Each screen can hold up to 15 icons (5 rows * 3 columns).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correct approach:
1. Calculate the space required for 2x2 icons: \( 4 \text{ cells per } 2 \times 2 \text{ icon} \times 4 \text{ icons} = 16 \text{ cells} \). Since each screen has 15 cells, 4 icons will require 2 screens.
2. Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons: \( 15 \times 2 - 16 = 10 \text{ cells} \).
3. Calculate the space required for 1x1 icons: \( 12 \text{ icons} \times 1 \text{ cell per icon} = 12 \text{ cells} \).
4. Determine how many more screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: \( \lceil \frac{12}{15} \rceil = 1 \text{ screen} \).

Thus, the total number of screens required is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \).

However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the number of screens needed. It fails to properly account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons and the correct distribution of 1x1 icons. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
