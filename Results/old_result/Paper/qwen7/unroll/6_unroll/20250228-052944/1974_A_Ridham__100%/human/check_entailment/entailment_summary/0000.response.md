Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( x \) and \( y \), which represent the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
3. The program calculates the space required for the 2x2 icons as \( y \times 4 \) (since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells) and the space required for the 1x1 icons as \( x \times 1 \) (since each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell).
4. It then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons, considering that each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns). This is done by dividing the total number of 2x2 icons by 2 (since each screen can fit up to 2 2x2 icons) and rounding up if there's any remainder.
5. After placing the 2x2 icons, it checks if the remaining space on the screens is enough to fit all the 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates how many additional screens are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons.
6. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps outlined above, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons based on the provided constraints.

Correctness: **True**
