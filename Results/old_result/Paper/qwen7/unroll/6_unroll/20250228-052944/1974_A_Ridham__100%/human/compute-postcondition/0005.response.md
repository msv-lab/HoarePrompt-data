Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `result` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `n`.

The code snippet `print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))` will print each element of the `result` list on a new line after converting each element to a string.

Since the exact values of `n` and the calculations inside the loop are not specified, we cannot determine the exact contents of the `result` list. However, we know that `result` is a list of integers generated from the loop based on `n`.

Therefore, the output will be a series of integers, each on a new line, derived from the loop conditions.

Output: **a series of integers, each on a new line, derived from the loop conditions based on `n`**
