Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-' where `s` is updated to the input string.**

The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged. The string `s` is now updated to the input provided by the user, which consists of characters '+' and '-' and has a length equal to `n`.
