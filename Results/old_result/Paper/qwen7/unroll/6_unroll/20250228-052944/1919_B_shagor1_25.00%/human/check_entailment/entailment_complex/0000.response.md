Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The core issue lies in the calculation of the minimum penalty. The provided code simply counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s` and uses this count to compute a value, which does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires splitting the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty, but the code does not attempt any such splitting or calculation of penalties.

The provided solution only considers a simple formula `n - 2 * neg` and prints it without considering the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. This approach fails to account for the correct logic required to solve the problem as described.

Therefore, the given program is not correct for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
