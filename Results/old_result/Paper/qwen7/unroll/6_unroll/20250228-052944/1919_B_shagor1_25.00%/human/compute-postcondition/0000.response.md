Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters '+' and '-'**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the string `s` is not defined yet but will be defined later when the input for `s` is provided. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range [1, 1000], `n` is now an input integer within the range [1, 5000], and `s` will be a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
