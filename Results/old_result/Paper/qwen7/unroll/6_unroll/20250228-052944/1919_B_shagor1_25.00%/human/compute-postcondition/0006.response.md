Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
- `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.

The code snippet to be evaluated is:
```python
print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
```

Let's break down the expression inside the `print` statement:

1. `neg` is the count of '-' characters in the string `s`.
2. The expression `n - 2 * neg` will be evaluated if `n` is not equal to `neg`.
3. If `n` is equal to `neg`, then the expression `n` itself will be printed.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider both cases:

- If `n` is not equal to `neg`, the output will be `n - 2 * neg`.
- If `n` is equal to `neg`, the output will be `n`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `neg` are not specified, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where `n` is the input integer and `neg` is the number of '-' characters in the string `s`)**
