Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, where `a` is a list of integers. After executing the loop, `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in each list `a`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, then `-1` is printed; otherwise, `ans` is printed.
