You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each `i` from 0 to `t-1`, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, where `a` is a list of integers. After executing the loop, `ans` is the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in each list `a`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, then `-1` is printed; otherwise, `ans` is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then determines the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same integer in the list `a`. If the list has only one element or the minimum segment length equals the list size, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the minimum segment length.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to count the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and then outputs `n - longest_sequence` as the result. However, this approach does not account for the requirement to remove elements to break the beauty condition.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program would output `1`, but the correct answer should be `1`. Here’s why:

- The array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` is beautiful because `a_2 = a_4` and we can replace `a_3` with `a_2` to make the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, which is still beautiful.
- To break the beauty condition, we need to remove at least one element. Removing `a_3` (`1`) results in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`, which is not beautiful anymore.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as `1` because it finds the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements, which is `1` in this case. It then outputs `5 - 1 = 4`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to identify the longest subsequence that can be made beautiful and then calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break this condition. This requires a more complex algorithm that checks for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements strategically.
