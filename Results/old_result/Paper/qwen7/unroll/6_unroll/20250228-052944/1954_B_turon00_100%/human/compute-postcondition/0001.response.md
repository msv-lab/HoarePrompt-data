Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given to be a positive integer, the loop will always execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: The only variable that needs adjustment is `t`, and it must be set to a positive integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
