Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 sets of inputs, where each set consists of integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). For each set, it calculates a value \( s \) using a specific formula and compares it with \( a \). If \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( s \), it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each set of inputs.**
