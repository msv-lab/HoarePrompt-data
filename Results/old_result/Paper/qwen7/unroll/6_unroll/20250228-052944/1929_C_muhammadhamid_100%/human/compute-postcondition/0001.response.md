Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. After the loop executes all the iterations, s is an integer calculated based on the formula \(s = 1\), and for each iteration, \(s = s + \frac{s}{k-1} + 1\) for \(x\) times, and 'Yes' or 'No' is printed based on whether \(a \geq s\). The values of t, k, x, and a remain unchanged from their initial states.
