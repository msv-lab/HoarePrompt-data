Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Strategy for Winning Any Number of Coins**: The problem requires Sasha to be able to win any number of coins, which means he should be able to increase his coins indefinitely by making strategic bets. However, the given solution does not simulate the betting process accurately.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Required Coins**: The solution calculates `s` using a loop where `s` is incremented by `s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations. This calculation does not reflect the actual betting strategy needed to ensure Sasha can win any number of coins. Specifically, the formula used here does not account for the fact that Sasha needs to be able to recover from losses and continue betting to increase his coins.

3. **Simplified Logic**: The logic in the provided solution simplifies the problem too much. It assumes that Sasha can just keep betting in a way that guarantees he can win any number of coins, but it doesn't properly simulate the betting rounds and the constraints of winning and losing.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the betting process and check if Sasha can always recover from losses and eventually win any number of coins. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # If the initial coins are less than or equal to k-1, Sasha cannot win any number of coins
        if a <= k - 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            # Sasha can always win any number of coins if he starts with enough coins
            print('Yes')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:
1. **Initial Check**: If Sasha's initial coins (`a`) are less than or equal to `k - 1`, he cannot make any bets because the minimum bet is 1 coin, and he would lose immediately. Hence, the answer is "No".
2. **General Case**: If Sasha starts with more than `k - 1` coins, he can always make bets in a way that ensures he can recover from losses and eventually win any number of coins. Therefore, the answer is "Yes".

This approach correctly handles the constraints and logic required to determine if Sasha can win any number of coins.
