Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
2. The provided solution simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case.
3. Let's analyze whether \( x - 1 \) is always the optimal choice:
   - If \( y = x - 1 \), then \(\gcd(x, x-1) = 1\) because \( x \) and \( x-1 \) are consecutive integers and thus coprime.
   - Therefore, \(\gcd(x, x-1) + (x-1) = 1 + (x-1) = x\).
4. We need to check if there could be a better \( y \) that would yield a larger value for \(\gcd(x, y) + y\):
   - For any \( y < x - 1 \), \(\gcd(x, y)\) will be at most \( y \), and thus \(\gcd(x, y) + y \le y + y = 2y < x\).
   - Hence, \( x - 1 \) indeed gives the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution is correct because it always finds the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) by choosing \( y = x - 1 \).

Correctness: **True**
