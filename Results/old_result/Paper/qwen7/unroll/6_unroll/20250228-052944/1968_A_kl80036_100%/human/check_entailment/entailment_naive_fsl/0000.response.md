Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly find the value of \( y \) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. Instead, it simply prints \( x - 1 \) for each test case, which is not necessarily the optimal solution.

For example, consider \( x = 10 \). The program would output \( y = 9 \), but the optimal \( y \) is actually \( 5 \), because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is greater than \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
