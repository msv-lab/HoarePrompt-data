Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 2*10^5), k (an integer between 1 and 10^9), PB and PS (integers between 1 and n), and two lists p and a (where p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and a contains integers between 1 and 10^9). Based on these inputs, the function returns either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw'.**
