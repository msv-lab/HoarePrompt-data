The only variable in the loop head is the variable `t`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is already a positive integer, it satisfies the condition `t` being non-zero, and no adjustment is necessary.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5**
