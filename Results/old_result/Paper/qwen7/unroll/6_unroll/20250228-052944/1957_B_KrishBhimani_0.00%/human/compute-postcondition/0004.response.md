Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates a list `ans` containing powers of 2 corresponding to the positions set in the binary representation of \( k \), and pads the list with zeros to ensure its length is \( n \). The function then prints this list for each test case.**
