You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        arr = []
        k0 = k
        i = 0
        while k:
            if k & 1 == 1:
                arr.append(i)
            k = k >> 1
            i += 1
        ans = []
        c = 0
        for i in arr:
            if c == n - 1:
                ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
                break
            c += 1
            ans.append(1 << i)
        ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates a list `ans` containing powers of 2 corresponding to the positions set in the binary representation of \( k \), and pads the list with zeros to ensure its length is \( n \). The function then prints this list for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence `a_1 | a_2 | ... | a_n` is maximized. Let's consider a specific case to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
2 5
```
The program should output a sequence of two numbers that sum to 5 and maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this. For instance, it might output `[1, 4]`, which sums to 5 but the bitwise OR is `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `101`), which is not necessarily the maximum possible.

A more appropriate approach would be to set most of the numbers to 0 and one number to `k` to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR. For example, for the input `2 5`, the correct output should be `[5, 0]` because `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), which has the maximum number of 1s possible for the given `k`.

Thus, the program does not always produce the correct sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR, making it incorrect.
