n is an integer representing the size of the n \times n chessboard, and k is an integer representing the number of moves you have already played, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The function also assumes that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
