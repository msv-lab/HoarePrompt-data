State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will start with `i` being 0 and will continue as long as `i` is less than `t`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be incremented from 0 to 1, which means `t` must be greater than 0.
3. Since `t` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, we know that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to start.
4. The initial value of `i` is set to 0 by the loop itself when it begins.

Therefore, the only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, and we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` is already set to 0.

Hence, the required state adjustment is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 0**.
