Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, it processes three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (where 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i in range(n)). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the given data according to the specified conditions.**
