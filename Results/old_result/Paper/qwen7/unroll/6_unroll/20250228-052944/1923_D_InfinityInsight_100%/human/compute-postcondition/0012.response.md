Output State: **The program returns a list 'ans' of n elements where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.**

This means that for each slime size in the list `a`, the program will return either -1 if there is no such position, or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between. The list `ans` will contain these values for each corresponding slime size in the list `a`.
