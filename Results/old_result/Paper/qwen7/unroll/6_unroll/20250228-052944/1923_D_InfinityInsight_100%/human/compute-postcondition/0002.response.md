Output State: **`a` is a list of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, `left` is [0], `last` is [-1], `ans` is a list of n elements all initialized to -1**.

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of length `n` (where `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`) with each element set to `-1`. The lists `left` and `last` remain unchanged from their initial states.
