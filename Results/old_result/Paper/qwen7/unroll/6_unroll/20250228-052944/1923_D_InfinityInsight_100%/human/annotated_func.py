If `x` is found, it returns the index of `x` in the list `a` incremented by one. If `x` is not found, it returns `None`.

    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' of n elements where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of n non-negative integers representing the sizes of the slimes, and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` of n elements, where each element is either -1 or the position from which the current slime size can be traced back to its first occurrence without encountering a smaller slime size in between. The function constructs this list by first identifying the last occurrence of each slime size and then calculating the trace-back positions based on cumulative sums and comparisons.
