Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index, but it does not fully capture the optimal strategy required for both players to play optimally. Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Game Dynamics Not Fully Captured**: The program does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. Instead, it tries to identify the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index without considering the sequence of moves and the constraints imposed by the game rules.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The program does not implement any logic to ensure that both players play optimally. It simply finds the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index, which does not account for the strategic decisions made by both players during their turns.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the result directly without returning it, which is acceptable for the given problem format. However, the core logic for determining the optimal MEX is flawed.

Given these points, the program does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX under the given conditions.

Correctness: **False**
