Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5), and an array a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of t, n, and array a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another integer `n`, and an array of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns specific information related to them, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
