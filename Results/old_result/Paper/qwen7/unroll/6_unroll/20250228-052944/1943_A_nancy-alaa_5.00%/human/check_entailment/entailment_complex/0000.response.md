Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally.
2. The provided code attempts to solve the problem by identifying the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index if the smallest unique index has already been encountered.
3. However, the logic in the provided code does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically:
   - The code does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
   - It does not account for the fact that Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX, while Bob tries to minimize it.
   - The code simply checks for the presence of indices in the array `arr` and does not simulate the game turns.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
