Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) and an array a of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, either the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index (if the first smallest unique index has already been encountered) is printed, or if no such index exists, the loop terminates without printing anything.
