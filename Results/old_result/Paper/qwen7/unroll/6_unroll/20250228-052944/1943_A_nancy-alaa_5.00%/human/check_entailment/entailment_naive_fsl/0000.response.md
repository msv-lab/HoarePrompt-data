Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game described. Specifically, it does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob in the optimal strategy. The program simply checks for the presence of each integer in the array `arr` and prints the first integer that is not present, assuming that the integer represents the MEX of the array `c`. However, this approach does not consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob and the optimal strategy they would employ.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

The expected output should be:
```
2
1
0
```

However, the provided program will produce incorrect results because it does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob. For instance, in the first test case, the optimal strategy would involve Alice and Bob picking elements such that the MEX of the resulting array `c` is maximized for Alice and minimized for Bob. The program fails to capture this dynamic and thus does not provide the correct MEX value for the final array `c`.
