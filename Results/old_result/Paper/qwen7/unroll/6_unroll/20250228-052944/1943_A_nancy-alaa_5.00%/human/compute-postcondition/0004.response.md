Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it prints either the smallest missing index or the second smallest unique index (if the smallest unique index has already been encountered), or nothing if no such index exists. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
