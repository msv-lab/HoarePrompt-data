Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the product of the multipliers is very large, leading to overflow issues when calculating the least common multiple (LCM). Specifically, the program calculates the LCM of the multipliers and then distributes the coins based on this LCM value. However, if the LCM value is too large, the division operations may result in incorrect values due to integer overflow.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

The LCM of `[5, 5, 5, 5, 5]` is `5`, but the program still attempts to distribute the coins based on this value, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The correct approach would be to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the smallest possible win, which in this case is `5`.

A correct solution would involve ensuring that the total bet is less than the minimum win, rather than relying on the LCM calculation. Here's a revised version of the program that addresses this issue:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        bets = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        min_win = min(a)
        total_bet = sum([min_win - 1 for _ in range(bets)])
        if total_bet >= min_win:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ' '.join(str(min_win - 1) for _ in range(bets))
            print(ans)

func()
```

This revised program ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the minimum win, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
