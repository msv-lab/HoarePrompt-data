Reasoning:

The given program aims to solve the problem by distributing coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The approach taken in the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Calculating LCM**: The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for the outcomes using the `lcm` function. This step is crucial because it helps in determining the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all multipliers, ensuring that the distribution of coins meets the requirement.
3. **Distributing Coins**: For each outcome, the program divides the LCM by the corresponding multiplier to determine the amount to bet. This ensures that the total amount bet is proportional to the LCM, which is a key part of the solution.
4. **Summing Bets**: The program sums up the amounts bet for all outcomes. If this sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it indicates that the distribution does not meet the requirement, and the program prints `-1`.
5. **Printing Results**: If the sum is less than the LCM, the program constructs and prints the distribution of coins.

The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem statement and the example provided. The program correctly handles the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
