Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a` for each outcome.

2. **Least Common Multiple Calculation**: The program calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function defined within the `func` function. This is done correctly by iteratively applying the formula for LCM.

3. **Bet Calculation**: For each outcome, the program calculates the bet amount as `prod // a[i]`, where `prod` is the LCM of all multipliers. This ensures that the bet amount is an integer and is the largest possible bet that keeps the total bet amount strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

4. **Validation and Output**: The program checks if the sum of all bet amounts (`sumo`) is greater than or equal to the LCM (`prod`). If it is, it prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it constructs and prints the bet amounts for each outcome.

5. **Constraints and Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement. It ensures that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome, which is a key requirement of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
