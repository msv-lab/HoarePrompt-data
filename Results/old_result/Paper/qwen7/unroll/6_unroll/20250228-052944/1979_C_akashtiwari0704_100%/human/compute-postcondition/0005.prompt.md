You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, bets is the number of integers in the list a, prod is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in a, sumo is the sum of the elements in a after dividing each element by prod, and ans is a string containing the elements of a separated by spaces. If sumo is greater than or equal to prod, -1 is printed instead.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. The integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicates the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) represents the number of integers in the list, with each integer `k_i` (where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) being processed. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function returns results based on the processing of each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
