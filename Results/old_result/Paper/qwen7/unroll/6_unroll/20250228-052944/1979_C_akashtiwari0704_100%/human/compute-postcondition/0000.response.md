Output State: **t is an input integer, and each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all i. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\), the new state reflects that `t` is now explicitly assigned as an integer input. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
