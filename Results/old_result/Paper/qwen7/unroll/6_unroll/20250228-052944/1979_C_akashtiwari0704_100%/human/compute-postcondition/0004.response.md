Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`. The integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicates the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50) represents the number of integers in the list, with each integer `k_i` (where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) being processed. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function returns results based on the processing of each test case.**
