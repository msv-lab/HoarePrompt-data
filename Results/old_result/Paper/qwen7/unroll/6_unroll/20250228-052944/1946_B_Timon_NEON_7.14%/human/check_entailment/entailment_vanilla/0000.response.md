Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

### Code Analysis
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It seems to be used to handle the final result, but it doesn't seem to be directly related to the main logic of the problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
               total_max_segment = segment
       if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
           total_max_segment = [-1]
       return total_max_segment
   ```

   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It does not correctly identify the maximum sum subarray and instead tries to track segments, which is unnecessary for the problem.
   - The function should focus on finding the maximum sum subarray and not try to track multiple segments.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   This function is incomplete and does not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem. It appears to be a placeholder or a function that needs to be implemented.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly:
- Calculate the initial sum of the array.
- Use the fact that adding a subarray sum to the array can increase the sum by the sum of the subarray.
- Since we can add up to `k` subarray sums, the optimal strategy is to add the largest possible subarray sums.

### Conclusion
The given code does not correctly implement the solution. Specifically, `func_2` is flawed and `func_3` is incomplete. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
