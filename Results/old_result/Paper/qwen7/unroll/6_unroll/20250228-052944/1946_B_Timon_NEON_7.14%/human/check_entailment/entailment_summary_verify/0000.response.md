### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the problem statement to determine the accuracy of the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array by performing exactly `k` operations.
- Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Provided Functions:
1. **`func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - This function is not used in the main logic and does not affect the solution.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray.
   - However, it does not account for the insertion of the sum of any subarray multiple times (i.e., `k` operations).
   - It only finds the maximum sum subarray once and does not consider the possibility of inserting this sum multiple times.

3. **`func_3`**:
   - This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.
   - It initializes `answer` to 0 and does not return any value.
   - The function does not perform any operations related to the problem requirements.

#### Analysis:
- The core issue with the current implementation is that none of the functions properly handle the logic required to maximize the sum of the array through `k` operations.
- `func_2` only finds the maximum sum subarray once, but it does not account for the repeated insertion of this sum.
- `func_3` is completely irrelevant and does not contribute to the solution.

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect as it does not handle the required logic for maximizing the sum of the array through `k` operations.
