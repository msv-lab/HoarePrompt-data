The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a list containing a single element, which is `-1`. The function attempts to find segments within the array where the sum of elements is non-negative and updates the maximum segment found. However, due to the logic in the code, no such segment is identified, resulting in the return value being `-1`.
