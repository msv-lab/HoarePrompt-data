You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where -10^9 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for each element arr[i].
def func_2(arr):
    new_segment = []
    max_segment = [0, 0]
    segments_variants = []
    max_sum = -1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if new_segment:
            if arr[i] < 0:
                if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                else:
                    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                    max_segment = new_segment
                new_segment = []
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
            else:
                max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                new_segment[0] += arr[i]
        else:
            if arr[i] >= 0:
                new_segment = [arr[i], i]
            max_segment[0] += arr[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The provided code aims to find segments in the array where the sum of elements is non-negative and updates the maximum segment found. However, the code logic does not seem to correctly update the `max_segment` or `new_segment` lists during the iterations. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations inside the loop, no segment with a positive sum is found, hence `max_sum` remains 0, `new_segment` and `max_segment` remain empty, and `segments_variants` also remains empty.
    segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
    total_max_segment = [-1]
    for segment in segments_variants:
        if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
            total_max_segment = segment
        
    #State: Output State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [0, 0, len(arr) - 1].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each `segment` in `segments_variants`. During each iteration, it checks if the first element of `total_max_segment` is less than the first element of the current `segment`. If it is, `total_max_segment` is updated to the current `segment`. Since `segments_variants` only contains one segment initially and no new segments are added or modified within the loop, `total_max_segment` will be updated to the only segment available in `segments_variants`, which is `[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`max_sum`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
    if (len(total_max_segment) == 1) :
        total_max_segment = [-1]
    #State: `max_sum` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is [[0, 0, len(arr) - 1]], `total_max_segment` is [-1]
    return total_max_segment
    #The program returns total_max_segment which is [-1]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers where each element is within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns a list containing a single element, which is -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns total_max_segment which is [-1]


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
