Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and t is assigned the value of int(input()).**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 3 * 10^4, after executing the code, `t` will be set to the integer value entered by the user, which must satisfy the given constraints. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
