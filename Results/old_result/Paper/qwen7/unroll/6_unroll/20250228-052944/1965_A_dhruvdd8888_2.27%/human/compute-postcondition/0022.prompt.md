You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; the list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n represents the initial number of stones in each pile, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = set(input().split())
    nums = sorted(map(int, nums))
    if (len(nums) == 1) :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice' and returns None
    #State: `nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original set of strings, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 1
    if (len(nums) == 2) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' to the console
    #State: Postcondition: `nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original set of strings, and the length of `nums` is not equal to 2
    nums.insert(0, 0)
    cd = 0
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i + 1] - nums[i] == 1:
            cd += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of 1 in the list `nums`, starting from the second element. The length of `nums` remains unchanged.
    if (cd & 1) :
        return print('Bob')
        #The program prints 'Bob' and returns None
    else :
        return print('Alice')
        #The program prints 'Alice'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None. It determines whether to print 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on certain conditions involving test cases, piles of stones, and their counts. Depending on the outcome, it may also return None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program prints 'Alice' and returns None

Case_2: The program prints 'Bob' to the console

Case_3: The program prints 'Bob' and returns None

Case_4: The program prints 'Alice'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
