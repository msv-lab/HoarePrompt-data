Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers converted from the original set of strings.**

Explanation: The code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts each element in the set `nums` (which contains strings) to integers using `map(int, nums)` and then sorts these integers in ascending order. Since the exact values of the elements in `nums` were not specified, we can only say that `nums` is now a sorted list of integers derived from the original set.
