Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), operations (a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers - op_type and value), and queries (a list of positive integers). It performs a series of operations based on the tuples in the operations list and appends results to an array according to the op_type and value provided. After all operations are performed, it returns an empty list named result.**
