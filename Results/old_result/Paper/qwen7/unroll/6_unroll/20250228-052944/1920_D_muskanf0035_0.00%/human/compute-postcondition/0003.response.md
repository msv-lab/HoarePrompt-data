The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: An integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `q`: An integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 10^5.
- `operations`: A list of n lists, where each inner list contains two integers: `b` (such that `b ∈ {1, 2}`) and `x` (such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9).
- `queries`: A list of q integers `k_i` such that 1 ≤ k_i ≤ min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after performing all n operations.

The function does not return a direct value but processes the `operations` and `queries` to produce results based on the given constraints. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to process a series of operations and then handle a set of queries based on the results of those operations, where the final results depend on the values of `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, q, operations, and queries. It processes a series of operations and then handles a set of queries based on the results of those operations.**
