Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` as well as the pairs of friends and their friendship values `f_i`.

2. **Modulo Constant**: The constant `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is appropriate for handling large numbers and ensuring results fit within standard integer limits.

3. **Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\). This is used in the calculation of the expected value, but the formula used seems incorrect. Specifically, \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) represents the total number of possible pairs of children, and its modular inverse is needed to adjust the expected value calculations. However, the code incorrectly uses `pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` without checking if the division is exact, which could lead to issues if \(n(n-1)\) is not even.

4. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` correctly accumulates the sum of all friendship values `f_i` for the pairs of friends.

5. **Expected Value Calculation**: The loop that calculates `s` should reflect the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` excursions. However, the current implementation does not correctly model the expected value. The term `c * i * c * m` and `c * a` do not accurately represent the expected increase in friendship values due to the random selection process.

6. **Modulo Operation**: The final result `s % M` is computed correctly, but the intermediate steps need to be adjusted to properly calculate the expected value.

Given these points, the program's logic for calculating the expected value is flawed. The correct approach involves using the properties of expectation and linearity of expectation, but the current implementation does not follow these principles accurately.

Correctness: **False**
