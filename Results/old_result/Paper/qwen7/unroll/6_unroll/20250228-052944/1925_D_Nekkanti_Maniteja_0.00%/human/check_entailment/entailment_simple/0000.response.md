Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly initializes variables `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `c`**:
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( M \). This step is correct because it is used to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values (`a`)**:
   - The program correctly sums up the friendship values `f_i` for all pairs of friends. This part is also correct.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value calculation involves the formula \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \).
   - The program correctly sums this expression from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = k-1 \) and takes the result modulo \( M \).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the computed value for each test case, which is correct.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic and calculations as described in the problem statement. However, there is a potential issue with the calculation of `c`. The value \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) might not always be invertible modulo \( M \), especially when \( n \) is large. But since the problem guarantees that the sum of \( n \) and \( m \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 10^5 \), and the sum of \( k \) does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \), the specific constraints ensure that \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) is within a manageable range for modular arithmetic.

Therefore, the program should work correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
