### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program and why the original assessment is correct.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Contribution**:
   - The program uses `c * i * c * m` to calculate the contribution of each friendship value, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of each pair being chosen and how the friendship value changes over excursions.
   
2. **Missing Probabilistic Consideration**:
   - The program does not properly account for the probabilistic nature of choosing pairs. Each pair is chosen equiprobably and independently, and the expected value should reflect this.
   
3. **Incorrect Summation**:
   - The program sums up the initial friendship values (`a`) and multiplies it by `c`, but this does not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values over k excursions.

#### Correct Approach Outline:
1. **Calculate the Probability of Each Pair Being Chosen**:
   - The probability of any specific pair being chosen in a single excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   
2. **Calculate the Expected Increase in Friendship Value for Each Pair Over k Excursions**:
   - If a pair is chosen in an excursion, their friendship value increases by 1. The expected number of times a pair is chosen in k excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Therefore, the expected increase in friendship value for a pair over k excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Sum These Expected Values to Get the Final Result**:
   - Sum the expected increases for all pairs to get the total expected value of the sum of friendship values.

#### Detailed Analysis of Provided Program:

- **Line 4**: `M = 10 ** 9 + 7` is correct.
- **Line 6**: `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)` calculates the modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \), but this is not used correctly.
- **Line 8**: `s = 0` initializes the sum.
- **Line 10**: `a = 0` initializes the sum of friendship values.
- **Line 12 to 15**: The loop sums the friendship values for all pairs.
- **Line 17 to 20**: The loop attempts to add a term involving `c` and `i`, but this is not aligned with the expected value calculation.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
