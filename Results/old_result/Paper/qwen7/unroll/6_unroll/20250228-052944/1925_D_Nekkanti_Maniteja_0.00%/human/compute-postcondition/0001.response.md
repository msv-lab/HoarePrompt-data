Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Additionally, after executing the loop, s is an integer calculated as \(s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a) \mod M\), where \(M = 10^9 + 7\), \(c = (n \cdot (n - 1) // 2)^{-1} \mod M\), and a is the sum of f_i for all edges.
