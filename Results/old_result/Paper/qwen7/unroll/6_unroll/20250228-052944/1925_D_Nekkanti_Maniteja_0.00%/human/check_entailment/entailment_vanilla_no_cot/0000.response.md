Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \(k\) pairs chosen for the excursions. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**: 
   - The formula used in the code `c * i * c * m + c * a` is not correct for calculating the expected value.
   - The expected value calculation should consider the probability of choosing each pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.

2. **Misunderstanding of Probabilities**:
   - The code incorrectly assumes that the expected increase in friendship value is linear and does not account for the equiprobable and independent random selection of pairs.

3. **Modular Inverse Usage**:
   - While the modular inverse (`c`) is correctly calculated, it is not used appropriately in the context of the expected value calculation.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of linearity of expectation. For each pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over \(k\) excursions can be calculated as follows:

1. **Probability of Choosing a Pair**:
   - Each pair is chosen with equal probability in each excursion.
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair in any single excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

2. **Expected Increase in Friendship Value**:
   - For a pair of friends, the expected increase in friendship value over \(k\) excursions is \(k \times \text{probability of choosing the pair} = k \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
   - Since the friendship value increases by 1 each time the pair is chosen, the expected contribution to the sum from each pair of friends is \(k \times \frac{2f_i}{n(n-1)}\).

3. **Summing Over All Pairs**:
   - Sum the expected contributions from all pairs of friends to get the total expected value.

Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        inv_n = pow(n, -1, MOD)
        inv_n2 = pow(n * (n - 1), -1, MOD)
        
        total_sum = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            total_sum += f
        
        expected_value = (k * inv_n2 * total_sum) % MOD
        print(expected_value)

func()
```

This approach correctly calculates the expected value using the principles of linearity of expectation and modular arithmetic.
