You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer after all iterations of the loop have executed.
    #
    #In this output state, the value of `t` will be determined by the series of operations performed within the loop for each iteration from `i` in `range(n)`. The exact value of `t` will depend on the inputs provided for `a` and `b` in each iteration, but it will always be constrained between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The value of `n` will be the number of times the loop has iterated, which is specified as an input integer.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

### Case Analysis:
- **Input:** `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- **Expected Output:** According to the example, the expected output is `2`.

Let's manually calculate the minimum number of screens needed:
- Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells.
- We have 4 such icons, which occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells.
- Each screen has \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cells.
- Therefore, we need at least 2 screens to fit these 16 cells (since 15 cells per screen is not enough).

Now, let's run the provided program with the same input:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)

func()
```

When running the program with `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the output will be `1` instead of `2`. This is because the program does not correctly account for the total number of cells required and the distribution of `1x1` and `2x2` icons across multiple screens.

### Detailed Calculation:
- Total cells required for `2x2` icons: \(4 \times 4 = 16\)
- Cells available per screen: \(15\)
- Since 16 cells cannot fit into one screen, we need at least 2 screens.

However, the program calculates the number of screens as `1`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is **Incorrect**.
