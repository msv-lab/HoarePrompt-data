Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Let's consider a specific case to demonstrate this:

### Case Analysis:
- **Input:** `x = 12`, `y = 4`
- **Expected Output:** According to the example, the expected output is `2`.

Let's manually calculate the minimum number of screens needed:
- Each `2x2` icon occupies 4 cells.
- We have 4 such icons, which occupy \(4 \times 4 = 16\) cells.
- Each screen has \(5 \times 3 = 15\) cells.
- Therefore, we need at least 2 screens to fit these 16 cells (since 15 cells per screen is not enough).

Now, let's run the provided program with the same input:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b * 2
        if t % 5 == 0:
            t = t // 5
        else:
            t = t // 5 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)

func()
```

When running the program with `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the output will be `1` instead of `2`. This is because the program does not correctly account for the total number of cells required and the distribution of `1x1` and `2x2` icons across multiple screens.

### Detailed Calculation:
- Total cells required for `2x2` icons: \(4 \times 4 = 16\)
- Cells available per screen: \(15\)
- Since 16 cells cannot fit into one screen, we need at least 2 screens.

However, the program calculates the number of screens as `1`, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is **Incorrect**.
