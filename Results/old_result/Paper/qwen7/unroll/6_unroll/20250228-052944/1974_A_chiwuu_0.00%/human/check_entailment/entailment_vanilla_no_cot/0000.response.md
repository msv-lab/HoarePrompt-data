Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place the icons. Here's why:

1. **Calculation of Space Required for 2x2 Icons**: The program calculates `t` as `b * 2` and then divides by 5. This approach is flawed because it doesn't account for the fact that each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, not 2. So, the correct calculation should be `t = b * 4`.

2. **Space Calculation After Placing 2x2 Icons**: The next part of the code subtracts `b * 4` from `t * 15` to get the remaining space. However, this subtraction is not necessary and leads to incorrect results. Instead, we need to directly calculate how many 1x1 icons can fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

3. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons**: The logic for handling the remaining 1x1 icons is also incorrect. It should directly check if the remaining space can accommodate all the 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        total_cells = 5 * 3  # Total cells per screen
        screens = 0
        
        # Place 2x2 icons
        while b > 0:
            b -= 1
            a -= 4  # Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells
            screens += 1
        
        # Place 1x1 icons
        while a > 0:
            a -= 1
            screens += 1
        
        print(screens)
```

This corrected program ensures that the 2x2 icons are placed first, and then the remaining space is used to place the 1x1 icons, ensuring the minimum number of screens are used.
