State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `n > 0` must be true.
- Initially, `i` is set to 0 as per the `range(n)` function.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
