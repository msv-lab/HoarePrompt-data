Output State: **`vprod` is a list where each element is the result of `den` divided by each corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is the result of successively applying `func_1` to the first element of `vals` and each subsequent element in `vals`; `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`**.

Explanation: The code updates the value of `den` by subtracting the sum of the elements in `vprod` from the current value of `den`. The values of `vprod` and `vals` remain unchanged. The updated value of `den` is used in the next operation.
