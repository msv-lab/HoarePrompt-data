Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `vals` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `k_i` is between 2 and 20, and the values of `vals` are the integers inputted by the user.**

Explanation: The code reads `N` integers from the input and stores them in the list `vals`. Each integer in `vals` is between 2 and 20, as specified by the initial state. The value of `N` remains unchanged, and the list `vals` is updated with the new values.
