### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the problem and the logic implemented in the provided code. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
   - Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \), and if the \( i \)-th outcome wins, the player receives \( k_i \times \text{bet on } i \)-th outcome.

2. **Function `func_1(a, b)` Analysis:**
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the formula: \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).
   - This is correct because the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

3. **Function `func_2()` Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - Reads the number of outcomes \( N \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - **LCM Calculation:**
     - Initializes `den` with the first multiplier \( k_1 \).
     - Iteratively applies `func_1` to update `den` with each subsequent multiplier \( k_i \). This ensures `den` is the LCM of all multipliers.
   - **Bet Amount Calculation:**
     - Computes the bet amounts \( x_i \) as \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
     - These bet amounts ensure that the total bet is a multiple of each \( k_i \).
   - **Validation:**
     - Checks if the remaining value (LCM minus the sum of bet amounts) is positive.
     - If the remaining value is non-positive, it prints `-1`, indicating that the total bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any outcome.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The LCM calculation ensures that the bet amounts are feasible and can be evenly divided by each multiplier.
   - The validation step ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each outcome.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. The logic is sound, and the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly distributes the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.
