### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function processes a single row of river depths and calculates the cost of placing supports under the constraints.
   - It initializes the first element of the row to 1 and increments subsequent elements up to index `d` by 2.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find and update the minimum cost of placing supports while ensuring the distance constraint is maintained.
   - The function correctly computes the total cost of placing supports for the entire row and returns the final cost.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function processes the entire grid of river depths and calculates the minimum cost of building `k` bridges across `k` consecutive rows.
   - It iterates through each row, calculates the cost using `func_1`, and stores these costs in the `costs` list.
   - It then computes the minimum cost of building `k` bridges by considering all possible starting rows for the bridges and summing the costs of the corresponding rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost found.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly reads the input, processes each row to calculate the cost of placing supports, and then finds the minimum cost of building `k` bridges across `k` consecutive rows.
   - The logic and operations within both functions are consistent with the problem statement and constraints.
