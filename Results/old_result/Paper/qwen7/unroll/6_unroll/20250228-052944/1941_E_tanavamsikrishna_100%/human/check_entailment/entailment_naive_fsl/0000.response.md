Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the given constraints. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Support Placement**: The `func_1` function attempts to place supports in a way that ensures the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the logic inside the function does not properly ensure this condition is met for all possible placements of supports.

2. **Heap Usage Misunderstanding**: The function uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost up to a certain point, but it does not correctly update the costs for placing supports in all valid positions within the constraint `d`.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle edge cases where the optimal placement of supports might involve placing them closer together than the initial heuristic suggests. For example, if the depths in the row are such that placing supports closer together results in a lower total cost, the current implementation might not consider this.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```
The expected output should be 4, as the minimum cost for placing supports in the second row is achieved by placing them at positions (2, 2) and (2, 9). However, the provided function does not correctly calculate this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost of installing supports for building bridges, hence the correctness is **False**.
