Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of building bridges with the specified constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row of the river, ensuring that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`. It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the cheapest cells to place supports while maintaining the required distance constraint.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function processes the entire input and calculates the total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows. It iterates through each possible starting row for the bridges, calculates the cost using `func_1`, and then finds the minimum total cost among all these possibilities.

The program handles all the given constraints and examples correctly. It ensures that the cost calculations are accurate and that the minimum cost is found by considering all valid configurations of bridge placements. Therefore, the program is correct.
