Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n, m, k, and d, all of which are integers with specific constraints. It also accepts two additional parameters: rows, a list of n lists where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and costs, a list of n integers where each element is calculated by the function func_1(row, d) for the corresponding row in rows. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints and calculations.**

Note: The actual implementation details and logic for processing the data are not described here as per the instructions.
