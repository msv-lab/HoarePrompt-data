### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function takes a list `row` representing the depths of river cells in a single row and an integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between supports.
- It updates the values in `row` using a minimum heap to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
- The function returns the total cost of installing supports for the given row.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function processes the entire input and outputs the minimum total cost of installing supports for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
- It reads the dimensions and input data for the river grid.
- For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the cost of installing supports.
- It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost among these sets.
- Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

#### Problem Requirements:
- The river is represented as an \( n \times m \) grid where the first and last columns have a depth of 0.
- We need to build \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than \( d \).
- The cost of installing a support in cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

#### Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: 
   - The function correctly uses a minimum heap to ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - It updates the row values accordingly and returns the total cost, which is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It correctly reads the input dimensions and the river grid.
   - It calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It computes the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It finds and prints the minimum total cost among these sets.

Given the execution summaries and the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
