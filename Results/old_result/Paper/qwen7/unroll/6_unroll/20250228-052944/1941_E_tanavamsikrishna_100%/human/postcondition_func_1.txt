The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists (`rows`) and a list of \( n \) integers (`costs`). It calculates the sum of every consecutive sublist of length \( k \) from the `costs` list and stores these sums in a new list (`total_costs`). Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.
