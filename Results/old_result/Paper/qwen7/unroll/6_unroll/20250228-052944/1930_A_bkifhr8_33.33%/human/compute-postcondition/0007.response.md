Output State: `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs from the input lists for each iteration of the outer loop; `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `ans_f` contains the printed values from each iteration of the loop.
