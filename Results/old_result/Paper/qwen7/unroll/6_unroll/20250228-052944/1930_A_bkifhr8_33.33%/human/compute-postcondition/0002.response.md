State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `ans_f` is an empty list, `i` is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = t - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate numbers from 0 to `t-1`. Additionally, `t` should be within the specified range of 1 to 5000 inclusive.
3. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
4. The variable `ans_f` is mentioned to be an empty list, and its state does not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (to ensure it is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive) and `i` (which is set to 0 at the start of the loop).
