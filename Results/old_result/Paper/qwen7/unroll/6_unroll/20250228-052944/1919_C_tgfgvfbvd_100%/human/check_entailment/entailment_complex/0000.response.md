Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires splitting the array into two subsequences such that the total penalty (number of indices where the next element is greater than the current one) is minimized. However, the provided code attempts to find the minimum and second minimum values in the array and counts how many times these values are updated during the iteration. This approach does not guarantee the optimal split for minimizing the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to sort the array and then count the number of inversions (where an element is less than the previous element). By sorting, we ensure that the elements are in non-decreasing order, which minimizes the penalty since there will be no indices where an element is less than the previous one after sorting.

Given the provided code, it does not follow the correct approach to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
