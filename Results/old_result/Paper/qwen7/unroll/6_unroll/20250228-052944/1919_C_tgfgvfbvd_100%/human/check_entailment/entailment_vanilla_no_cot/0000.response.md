Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty as defined in the problem statement. The logic in the given code tries to find a way to split the array into two subsequences such that the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized. However, it does not guarantee that the splits are optimal in terms of minimizing the total penalty \( p(s) + p(t) \).

To solve this problem correctly, we need to sort the array and then split it in such a way that the number of increasing pairs in both subsequences is minimized. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array
        l.sort()
        
        # Initialize penalties for subsequences s and t
        penalty_s = 0
        penalty_t = 0
        
        # Determine the minimum penalty
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if l[i] < l[i + 1]:
                penalty_s += 1
            else:
                penalty_t += 1
        
        # The minimum penalty is the smaller of the two penalties
        print(min(penalty_s, penalty_t))

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution sorts the array and then counts the number of increasing pairs in the sorted array, which directly gives us the penalty for one subsequence. Since the array is sorted, the penalty for the other subsequence is trivially the remaining count. This ensures that the total penalty is minimized.
