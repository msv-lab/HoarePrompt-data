Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a\), \(b\), \(c\) represents a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). It then prints the corresponding label for each test case. The function does not return any value and leaves the input variables unchanged after its execution.**
