Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', based on the comparison of three integers (a, b, c) entered for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of n, which is the input integer defining the number of iterations. Each line's content depends on the specific values of a, b, and c entered during that iteration.
