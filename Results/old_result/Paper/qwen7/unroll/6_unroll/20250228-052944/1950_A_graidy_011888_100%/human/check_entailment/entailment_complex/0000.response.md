Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The conditions for determining whether the sequence forms a 'STAIR' or a 'PEAK' are correctly implemented:
   - `a < b < c` checks for a 'STAIR'.
   - `a < b and b > c` checks for a 'PEAK'.
4. If neither condition is met, it correctly outputs 'NONE'.
5. The function processes all test cases as required and does not modify the input variables after processing.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the function appears to be correctly implemented and should produce the expected output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
