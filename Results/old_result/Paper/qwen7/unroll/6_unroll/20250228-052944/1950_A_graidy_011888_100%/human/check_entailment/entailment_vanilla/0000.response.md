### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Reading Test Case Input**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints 'STAIR' if this condition is met.
   - It then checks if `a < b` and `b > c` and prints 'PEAK' if this condition is met.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` as per the problem statement.
   - It correctly identifies when the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Given that the program follows the logic specified in the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
