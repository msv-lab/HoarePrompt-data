Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns different outputs based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, it seems the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a value of `t` and pairs of values `(x, y)`. However, since the function definition itself does not explicitly mention accepting any parameters, the description focuses on the implied inputs and the expected behavior of the function based on those inputs.
