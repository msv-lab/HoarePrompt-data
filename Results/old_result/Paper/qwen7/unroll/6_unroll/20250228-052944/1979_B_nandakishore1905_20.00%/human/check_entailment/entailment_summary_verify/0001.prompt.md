You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        k = abs(n - m)
        if k & k - 1 == 0:
            print(k)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 != 0:
            print(1)
        elif n == 0 and m % 2 == 0:
            print(2)
        else:
            l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')
            p = len(l)
            q = 2 ** (p - 1)
            print(k - q)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two distinct non-negative integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k\) between \(n\) and \(m\), and then prints one of four possible values based on specific conditions involving \(k\): \(k\), \(1\), \(2\), or \(k - q\), where \(q\) is derived from the binary representation of \(k\). The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` for each test case, which correspond to `x` and `y` in the problem statement.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - The program calculates `k` as the absolute difference between `n` and `m`: `k = abs(n - m)`.
   - It then checks several conditions to determine the length of the longest common subsegment:
     - If `k & (k - 1) == 0`, it means `k` is a power of 2. In this case, it prints `k`.
     - If `n == 0` and `m` is odd, it prints `1`.
     - If `n == 0` and `m` is even, it prints `2`.
     - Otherwise, it converts `k` to binary and finds the length of the binary representation minus one, then subtracts `2^(p-1)` from `k` to get the final result.

3. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - The condition `k & (k - 1) == 0` checks if `k` is a power of 2. This is correct because the XOR of two numbers `x` and `y` results in a value whose binary representation has at most one bit set to 1 if `x` and `y` differ by a power of 2.
   - The special cases for `n == 0` handle the specific behavior when one of the numbers is zero, which is also correct.
   - The binary conversion and subtraction logic seems to be an attempt to find the highest power of 2 within `k`, but it does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the longest common subsegment length should be the highest power of 2 that divides both sequences' differences, not just `k`.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the example given in the problem, the program's output matches the expected results for the first three test cases, but it fails for the fourth test case due to the incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the length of the longest common subsegment. The special cases and the binary manipulation do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.
