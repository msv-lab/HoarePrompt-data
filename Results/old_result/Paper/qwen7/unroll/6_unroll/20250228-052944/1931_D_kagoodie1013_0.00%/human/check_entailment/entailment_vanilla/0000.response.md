Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
2. **Test Case Parsing**: It parses each test case correctly, extracting the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. **Function Call**: The parsed test cases are passed to the function `func_1` which is responsible for calculating the number of beautiful pairs.
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes counters and maps (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates through each number in the array, calculates its modulus with `x` and `y`, and updates the counts in the respective maps.
   - For each number, it checks how many previously seen numbers satisfy the conditions for being a "beautiful pair" and increments the count accordingly.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the `results` list and returns the list after processing all test cases.
5. **Output**: The results are printed in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the provided problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
