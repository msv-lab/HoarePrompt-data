Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the size of the array), x and y (integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each test case, the function returns a list results where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding arr. mod_x is calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.**
