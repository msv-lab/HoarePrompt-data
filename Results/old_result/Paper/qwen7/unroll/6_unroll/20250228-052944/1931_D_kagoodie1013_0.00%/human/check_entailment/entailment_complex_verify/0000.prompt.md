You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

    #The program returns a list 'results' where each element is the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) found in the corresponding 'arr' for each 'test_case', with mod_x calculated as -num % x and mod_y as num % y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array, two integers (x and y), and the array elements. For each test case, it calculates the count of pairs (mod_x, mod_y) for each element in the array, with mod_x being -num % x and mod_y being num % y. It then appends these counts to a results list, which it returns.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding beautiful pairs. Specifically, the program uses `mod_x = -num % x` which can lead to incorrect results because it does not handle negative numbers properly. For example, if `x = 5` and `num = 4`, `-num % x` would yield `1` instead of `4`. This can cause the program to miss valid beautiful pairs.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```

The expected output should be `2` because the pairs `<1, 5>` and `<4, 6>` are beautiful. However, due to the incorrect modulo calculation, the program might miss these pairs.

A corrected version of the program should use `(num - 1) % x + 1` to ensure the result is always non-negative. Here is a corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        mod_x_map = {}
        mod_y_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = (num - 1) % x + 1
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = (num - 1) % x + 1
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that the modulo operation handles negative numbers correctly, thus ensuring the program works as expected for all potential cases.
