Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using a mapping approach to keep track of the counts of remainders when divided by `x` and `y`. The logic is sound and should produce the correct output for the given examples and constraints.
