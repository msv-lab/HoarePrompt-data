Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is an integer indicating the length of the list plus one. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the maximum value between `arr[i] + ans[i-1]` and `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
