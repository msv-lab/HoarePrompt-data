Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500; `ans` is a list of n zeros; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `arr[0] + 1` to `ans[0]`. The other elements of the `arr` list and `ans` list remain unchanged. The value of `n` also remains unchanged.
