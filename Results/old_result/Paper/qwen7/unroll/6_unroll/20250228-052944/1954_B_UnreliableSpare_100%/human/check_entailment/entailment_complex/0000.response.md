Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. The provided code attempts to solve this by checking if the array has any consecutive different elements. If it finds any, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the initial element in the array. If no such consecutive different elements exist, it outputs -1.

3. The logic in the code is flawed because:
   - The function `func_1()` does not correctly identify whether the array is beautiful or not. It only checks for the presence of consecutive different elements but does not ensure that the array can be made beautiful by the given operation.
   - The calculation of `ans` is based on the assumption that the array is not already beautiful, which is not always true. The code should instead focus on finding the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and removing the rest.

4. The correct approach would involve identifying the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements and calculating the number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array. If the entire array is already beautiful, the answer should be -1.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
