Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not called correctly**: The function `func_1` should be called inside the loop where the test cases are processed. Currently, it is defined but never called within the main loop.

2. **Incorrect logic for checking if the array is beautiful**: The current logic checks if the array is already beautiful (all elements are the same). However, the problem states that the given array is always beautiful, so this check is unnecessary and misleading.

3. **Incorrect logic for counting removals**: The logic for counting the minimum number of removals is flawed. It assumes that removing elements where `arr[i] != val` will result in the minimum removals, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach involves identifying segments where the array is not beautiful and counting the minimum number of removals needed to break these segments.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Identify segments where the array is not beautiful
        segments = []
        start = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:
                if start < i-1:
                    segments.append((start, i-1))
                start = i
        if start < n-1:
            segments.append((start, n-1))
        
        # If there are no segments, the array is already beautiful
        if not segments:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Count the minimum number of removals needed
            min_removals = float('inf')
            for segment in segments:
                min_removals = min(min_removals, segment[1] - segment[0])
            print(min_removals)
```

This corrected program correctly identifies segments where the array is not beautiful and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break these segments.
