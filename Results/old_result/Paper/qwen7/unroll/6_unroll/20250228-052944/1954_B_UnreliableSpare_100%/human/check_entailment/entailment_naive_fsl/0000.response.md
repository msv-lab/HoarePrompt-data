Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify and count the minimum number of elements to remove for an array to stop being beautiful. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 2 2 2`, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - For the input `5 1 2 1 2 1`, the program outputs `1`, which is also correct because removing the element at index 5 makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` non-beautiful.
   - For the input `1 1`, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct because removing the first three elements `[3, 3, 3]` results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Potential Issue**:
   - However, the program has a logical flaw. It assumes that the first element `arr[0]` will always be the value to compare against, which is not necessarily true. The array could have different values that repeat in a pattern making it beautiful. The program should consider all possible values that can repeat consecutively and count the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the input `6 1 2 1 2 1 2`. The array is beautiful, and the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful is `1` (remove any one of the `2`s). However, the current implementation might fail to correctly identify this.

To fix this, the program needs to:
- Identify all repeating patterns in the array.
- Count the minimum number of removals required to break these patterns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_count = 0
    current_count = 1
    prev_val = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == prev_val:
            current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_count = 1
            prev_val = arr[i]
    
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    
    if max_count == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(n - max_count)
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the maximum length of consecutive identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.
