You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    (val, cnt) = (arr[0], 0)
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case defined by an integer `t`. It first checks if the list `a` contains consecutive different elements. If it does, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of the initial element in the list. If the list does not contain consecutive different elements, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the length of the longest sequence of consecutive occurrences of the initial element in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify and count the minimum number of elements to remove for an array to stop being beautiful. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `3 2 2 2`, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - For the input `5 1 2 1 2 1`, the program outputs `1`, which is also correct because removing the element at index 5 makes the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]` non-beautiful.
   - For the input `1 1`, the program outputs `-1`, which is correct because the array is already beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
   - For the input `7 3 3 3 5 3 3 3`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct because removing the first three elements `[3, 3, 3]` results in the array `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

2. **Potential Issue**:
   - However, the program has a logical flaw. It assumes that the first element `arr[0]` will always be the value to compare against, which is not necessarily true. The array could have different values that repeat in a pattern making it beautiful. The program should consider all possible values that can repeat consecutively and count the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

3. **Example of Failure**:
   - Consider the input `6 1 2 1 2 1 2`. The array is beautiful, and the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful is `1` (remove any one of the `2`s). However, the current implementation might fail to correctly identify this.

To fix this, the program needs to:
- Identify all repeating patterns in the array.
- Count the minimum number of removals required to break these patterns.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import copy, math, random, decimal
from decimal import Decimal

if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_count = 0
    current_count = 1
    prev_val = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] == prev_val:
            current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_count = 1
            prev_val = arr[i]
    
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    
    if max_count == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(n - max_count)
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the maximum length of consecutive identical elements and calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.
