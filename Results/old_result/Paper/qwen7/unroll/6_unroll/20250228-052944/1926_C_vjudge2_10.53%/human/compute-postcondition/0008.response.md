Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 (since `range(10)` generates values from 0 to 9).

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than 10.

4. **Check Other Variables**: The other variables (`total`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop. The values of `total`, `numbers`, `values`, and `sum_values` do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`i` is 0**
