Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the updated state of `t` is an input integer within this range. The precondition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 is not affected by this code and remains valid.
