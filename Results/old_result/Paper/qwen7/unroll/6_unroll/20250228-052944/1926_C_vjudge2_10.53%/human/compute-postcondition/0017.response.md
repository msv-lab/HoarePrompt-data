Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Based on these inputs, the function does not return a single value but seems to perform some operation or series of operations involving `t` and `n`.**

Given the constraints and the provided function signature, the function likely iterates over multiple test cases, each defined by `t` and `n`, and performs some computation or validation based on these values. However, without the actual implementation details, we can only describe its expected behavior in terms of input processing.
