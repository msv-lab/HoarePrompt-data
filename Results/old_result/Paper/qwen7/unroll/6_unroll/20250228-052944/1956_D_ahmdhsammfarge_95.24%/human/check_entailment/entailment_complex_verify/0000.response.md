### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` attempts to find the subarray that, when modified, would result in the maximum sum. However, the logic used to calculate `sm` is flawed. Specifically, `sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` does not accurately represent the sum of the elements within the subarray `a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r` after setting all elements in this subarray to the MEX of the subarray. The term `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:])` represents the sum of elements outside the subarray, which is irrelevant for calculating the MEX and the resulting sum.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` recursively appends operations to a list. However, it does not consider the actual impact of the operations on the sum of the array. The function simply appends operations without ensuring that they contribute to maximizing the sum.

#### Function `func_3`:
- The function `func_3` modifies the subarray to a constant value but does not ensure that the value chosen is the MEX of the subarray. The logic `lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]` sets the subarray to a constant value `n`, which is `l - r + 1`. This does not guarantee that the value chosen is the MEX of the subarray, which is essential for maximizing the sum.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements through the allowed operations. The functions do not properly calculate the MEX of the subarray and do not ensure that the operations chosen maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
