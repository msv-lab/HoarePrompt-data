Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[l:r + 1]` is 0, the function does not change the list `ops`. Otherwise, the list `ops` remains unchanged.
