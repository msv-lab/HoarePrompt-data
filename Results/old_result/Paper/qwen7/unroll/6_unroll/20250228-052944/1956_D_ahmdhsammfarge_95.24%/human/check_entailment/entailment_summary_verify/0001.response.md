### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several key issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems in more detail:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum of the array by considering the sum of elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray length. This approach is fundamentally flawed because the goal is to set all elements in a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray, not to add the square of the subarray length.
   - The MEX value is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. Setting all elements in a subarray to this value will ensure that the subarray contributes the highest possible value to the overall sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to generate a sequence of operations based on the result from `func_1`. However, the logic inside this function is incorrect. It recursively appends the same operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times without actually performing the MEX operation.
   - The function should identify the MEX value for the subarray and set all elements in the subarray to this value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function `func_3` attempts to perform the MEX operation and update the array. However, the logic here is also incorrect. It unnecessarily appends the same operation multiple times and does not correctly compute the MEX value or update the array.
   - The function should identify the MEX value for the subarray, set all elements in the subarray to this value, and record the operation.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the MEX value for each subarray.
2. Set all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
3. Record the operation performed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def mex(subarray):
    seen = set(subarray)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def max_sum_and_operations(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    max_sum = sum(arr)
    ops = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarray = arr[i:j+1]
            mex_val = mex(subarray)
            if mex_val > 0:
                arr[i:j+1] = [mex_val] * (j - i + 1)
                ops.append([i + 1, j + 1])
    
    return max_sum, len(ops), ops

# Example usage
arr = [1, 100, 2, 1]
max_sum, num_ops, operations = max_sum_and_operations(arr)
print(max_sum, num_ops, operations)
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the detailed analysis and the corrected implementation, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

**Final: False**
