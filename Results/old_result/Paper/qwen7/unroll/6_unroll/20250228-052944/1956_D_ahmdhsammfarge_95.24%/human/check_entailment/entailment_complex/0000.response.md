Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing operations that replace a segment of the array with the MEX (Minimum Excludant) value of that segment. The operations are limited to a maximum of \(5 \times 10^5\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function aims to find the optimal segment to replace by calculating the sum of the array excluding the segment and adding the squared length of the segment. However, there are several issues:
     - The logic for finding the optimal segment seems flawed because it doesn't actually calculate the MEX value but rather a sum of segments.
     - The function should ideally identify the segment with the lowest MEX value, but instead, it tries to maximize a different metric (`sm`).
   - **func_2**: This function is intended to append operations to the list `ops`. However, the recursive calls and the way it appends operations do not seem to align with the problem's requirements.
   - **func_3**: This function attempts to replace a segment with the MEX value. However, it incorrectly appends operations and does not correctly handle the replacement of the segment with the MEX value.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic is flawed because it relies on functions that do not correctly implement the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.
   - The primary issue is that the functions do not correctly identify and replace segments with the appropriate MEX values, leading to incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
