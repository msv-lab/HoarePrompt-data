### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems in more detail:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum of the array. However, the logic used to calculate the sum (`sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`) is not relevant to the problem. The goal is to set a subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, not to add the square of the subarray length.
   - The MEX value should be computed for the subarray and then used to update the subarray, but the current implementation does not do this.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations based on the result from `func_1`. However, the recursive calls and the way operations are appended are incorrect. The function should focus on updating the array to the MEX value of the chosen subarray, not just appending operations.
   - The function `func_2` incorrectly appends the same operation multiple times without performing the actual MEX operation.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to perform the MEX operation and update the array. However, the logic is flawed:
     - It appends the same operation multiple times without actually computing the MEX value.
     - It does not correctly compute the MEX value of the subarray.
     - It updates the array incorrectly by setting all elements in the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX value.

### Detailed Issues:
- **Incorrect Objective**: The functions do not correctly implement the MEX operation or the goal of maximizing the sum of the array.
- **Redundant Operations**: The functions append the same operation multiple times, which is unnecessary and incorrect.
- **Logic Errors**: The functions contain logical errors that prevent them from achieving the desired outcome.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**

This conclusion aligns with the original assessment, confirming that the program is indeed incorrect.
