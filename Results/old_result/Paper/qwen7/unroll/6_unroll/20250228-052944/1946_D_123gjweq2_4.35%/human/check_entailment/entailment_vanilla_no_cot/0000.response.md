Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The function `find_max` should return `-1` when it cannot form any valid segment with the current bit set to 1 in `x`. However, the base case handling is not properly implemented.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of New Array**: The logic for creating the `new_arr` is flawed. The XOR operation should be used to group elements such that the cumulative XOR up to each element is considered. The current implementation does not correctly group elements based on the current bit.

3. **Recursive Calls**: The recursive calls to `find_max` do not correctly handle the conditions to maximize the number of segments while ensuring the cumulative XOR does not exceed `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(arr, x):
    return find_max(arr, x, 0)

def find_max(arr, x, start):
    if start >= len(arr):
        return 0
    max_segments = 0
    current_xor = 0
    for end in range(start, len(arr)):
        current_xor ^= arr[end]
        if current_xor <= x:
            max_segments = max(max_segments, 1 + find_max(arr, x, end + 1))
        else:
            break
    return max_segments

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr, x))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Base Case**: If `start` exceeds the length of the array, return 0 as no more segments can be formed.
2. **Current XOR Calculation**: Use a sliding window approach to calculate the cumulative XOR from `start` to `end`.
3. **Segment Formation**: If the cumulative XOR is within the limit (`current_xor <= x`), recursively call `find_max` for the next segment starting from `end + 1`.
4. **Max Segments Calculation**: Track the maximum number of segments that can be formed while ensuring the cumulative XOR does not exceed `x`.

This approach ensures that the solution correctly handles the constraints and requirements of the problem.
