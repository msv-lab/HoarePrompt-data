Postcondition: `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik, `new_arr` is a list containing elements where each element is the cumulative XOR of subarrays of `cur_arr` whose XOR value in the current bit position is 1 if `xor >> bit & 1` is 1, otherwise the XOR value in the current bit position is 0, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is either -1 or the result of the function `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` depending on the condition `xor >> bit & 1`.

This means that after the if-else block executes, `new_arr` will contain the cumulative XOR values of subarrays of `cur_arr` based on the current bit position, `xor` remains 0, and `thing1` will be -1 if the current bit position's XOR value is 1, otherwise it will be the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
