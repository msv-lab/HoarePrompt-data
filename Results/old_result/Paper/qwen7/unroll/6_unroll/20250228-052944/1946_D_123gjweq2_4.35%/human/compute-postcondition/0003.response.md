Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a subarray of the original array `a`, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered (starting from the most significant bit to the least significant bit), and `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `new_arr` as an empty list. No changes are made to `cur_arr` or `bit`, and `x` remains unchanged. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, while `new_arr` is explicitly set to an empty list.
