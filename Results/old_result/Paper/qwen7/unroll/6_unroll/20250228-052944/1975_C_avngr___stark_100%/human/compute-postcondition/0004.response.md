Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a consisting of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^5.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters t, n, and array a. The function processes these inputs and returns a result, ensuring that the total count of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
