The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then calculates a value \( ans \) based on specific conditions involving the first and last elements of the list and consecutive equal elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated \( ans \) for each test case.
