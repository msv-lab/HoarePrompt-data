Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The program attempts to handle the operation by checking if the first and last elements are the same and then calculating the span. However, it doesn't consider the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing different segments of the array.
   
2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The program does not handle edge cases where the array might have multiple segments that need to be made equal. For instance, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the program would incorrectly calculate the answer as `4` instead of finding the optimal segment to change.

3. **General Strategy Missing**: The program lacks a general strategy to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal. It only considers simple checks without considering the optimal segment to change.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Identify the unique values in the array.
- For each unique value, find the minimum cost to make all elements equal to that value using at most one operation.
- Return the minimum cost among all unique values.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Dictionary to store the last occurrence of each element
        last_occurrence = {}
        for i in range(n):
            last_occurrence[a[i]] = i
        
        min_cost = float('inf')
        
        # Iterate through each unique element in the array
        for val in set(a):
            # Find the maximum length subarray where all elements are equal to 'val'
            max_length = 0
            start = -1
            for i in range(n):
                if a[i] == val:
                    if start == -1:
                        start = i
                    max_length = max(max_length, i - start + 1)
                else:
                    start = -1
            
            # Calculate the cost to make all elements equal to 'val'
            cost = n - max_length
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
        
        print(min_cost)

func()
```

This approach ensures that you correctly identify the minimum cost to make all elements equal using at most one operation.
