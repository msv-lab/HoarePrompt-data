Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in s:`. The only variable involved here is `i`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over each character in the string `s`, the initial value of `i` should be the first character of the string `s`.

3. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `m`, `us`, `win`, `ans`, `ps`) are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

4. **Ensure the String `s` is Not Empty**: For the loop to execute at least once, the string `s` must contain at least one character.

Based on these observations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i`, which should be the first character of the string `s`.

**State:**
**`i` is the first character of the string `s`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a non-empty string, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a', `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0.**
