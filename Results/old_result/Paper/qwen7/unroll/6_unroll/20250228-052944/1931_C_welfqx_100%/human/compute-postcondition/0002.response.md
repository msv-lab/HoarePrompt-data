Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the result of the loop's execution for each test case. For each test case, if the array `num` is not uniform (i.e., not all elements are the same), the output will be `n - max(cn, ck)`, where `cn` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of identical elements from the start, and `ck` is the length of the longest consecutive sequence of identical elements from the end. If the first and last elements are the same, `cn` and `ck` are combined. If the array is uniform or has only one element, the output will be `0`.
