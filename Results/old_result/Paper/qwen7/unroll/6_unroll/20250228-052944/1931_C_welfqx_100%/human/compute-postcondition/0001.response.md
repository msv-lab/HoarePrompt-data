Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in the given code is `for r in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `r` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `t` is given as an input integer, representing the number of test cases.
   - `r` is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `t-1`.

3. **Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1 because `range(t)` will generate values from 0 to `t-1`.
   - `r` will start from 0 and increment until it reaches `t-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `t` is the number of test cases, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `r` will start from 0 in the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (it must be at least 1) and `r` (it starts from 0).

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is at least 1, `r` is 0**
