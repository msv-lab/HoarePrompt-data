Output State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the value printed for each test case after the loop has executed all its iterations. For each test case, the output is calculated based on the logic inside the loop, which essentially finds the longest consecutive sequence of the same number in both the original and reversed arrays, and then prints the length of the array minus the maximum length of these sequences.
