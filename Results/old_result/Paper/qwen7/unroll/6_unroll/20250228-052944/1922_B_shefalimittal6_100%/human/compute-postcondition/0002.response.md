Output State: **`idx` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` is updated to contain `n` integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The line `idx = 0` initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables and the list `a` remains unchanged.
