Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` is updated to contain `n` integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but the list `a` is updated to contain these split strings as elements.
