State: **`idx` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.
2. **Determine the conditions for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the initial state of `idx` is 2 and `results` is an empty list, these do not affect the loop's ability to execute. However, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
