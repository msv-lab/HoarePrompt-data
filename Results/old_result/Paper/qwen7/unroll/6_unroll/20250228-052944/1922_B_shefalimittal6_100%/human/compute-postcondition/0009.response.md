Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is defined as `2 + 2*t`, where `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
   - `results` is a list containing strings calculated from the loop executions.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

Given the initial state, we know that `results` is a list of strings, and the code snippet is printing these strings with each string separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Since the exact values of the strings in `results` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact content of the printed output. However, we can describe the structure of the output.

The output will consist of the contents of the `results` list, each item on a new line.

Output: **the contents of the `results` list, each item on a new line**
