The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer t (number of cases), an integer n (size of the list), and a list a of n integers. It calculates a result based on the frequency of elements in the list a and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.
