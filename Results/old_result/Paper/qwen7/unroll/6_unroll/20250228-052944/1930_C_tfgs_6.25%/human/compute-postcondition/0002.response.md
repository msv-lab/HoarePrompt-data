State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` must be 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will start with `i = 0` and continue until `i < n`.
2. The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.
3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(n)` will generate numbers starting from 0 up to `n-1`.
4. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before entering the loop, as `range(n)` starts counting from 0.
5. The variables `t` and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.
