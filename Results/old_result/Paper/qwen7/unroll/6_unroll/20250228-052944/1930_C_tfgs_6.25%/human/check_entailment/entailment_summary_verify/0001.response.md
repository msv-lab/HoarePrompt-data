### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to perform operations on the array `a` and insert values into a set `S`.
   - After performing these operations, we sort the set `S` in descending order to form array `b`.
   - We aim to find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

2. **Key Points in the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
   - It then modifies each element `a[i]` by adding `i + 1` to it.
   - It uses `Counter` to count occurrences and `set` to ensure uniqueness before sorting in descending order.
   - It constructs the final array `b` by considering the differences between consecutive elements and ensuring the largest possible values are placed first.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code correctly modifies each element in `a` by adding `i + 1`.
   - It uses `Counter` to handle duplicate values and ensures uniqueness in the set.
   - The sorting of the set in descending order is done correctly.
   - However, the construction of the final array `b` has some issues:
     - The logic for handling the remaining elements (`cnt`) is flawed. Specifically, the loop that appends additional elements to `ans` to ensure the list contains `n` elements, each decremented by 1 from the previous element, does not correctly reflect the lexicographically largest possible `b`.
     - The program does not guarantee that the final array `b` is lexicographically largest. For example, consider the input `[6, 4, 8]`. The program will produce `[11, 7, 6]`, but the lexicographically largest `b` should be `[11, 8, 7]`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the differences between consecutive elements and the remaining count of each element do not allow for the construction of the lexicographically largest `b`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to generate the lexicographically largest possible `b`. The approach used in the `func_1` function does not ensure that the final array `b` is the lexicographically largest possible.
