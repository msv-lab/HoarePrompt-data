Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Operations**:
   - We need to perform `n` operations where in each operation, we select an index `i`, insert `a[i] + i` into a set `S`, and delete `a[i]` from `a`.
   - After `n` operations, `a` will be empty.
   - We then sort `S` in decreasing order to form array `b`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Find the lexicographically largest possible `b`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The set `S` cannot have duplicate values.
   - The insertion operation ensures that each value `a[i] + i` is unique because `i` is unique for each operation.

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It modifies `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`.
   - It uses `Counter` to count occurrences of each modified value.
   - It converts the list to a set to ensure uniqueness and sorts it in reverse order.

3. **Building the Result Array `ans`**:
   - It iterates through the sorted list `a` and constructs `ans` by ensuring the differences between consecutive elements are minimized while maintaining the required counts.
   - It handles remaining elements by appending the last value minus 1 until the required count is met.

### Detailed Reasoning
- **Step 1**: Modifying `a` by adding `i + 1` ensures that each value `a[i] + i` is unique.
- **Step 2**: Using `Counter` and converting to a set ensures that `S` contains unique values.
- **Step 3**: Sorting in reverse order gives the highest possible values first.
- **Step 4**: Constructing `ans` by ensuring minimal differences between consecutive elements ensures the lexicographically largest result.

### Testing Specific Cases
1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2`
     - `2 1`
   - Expected Output: `3 2`
   - Explanation: 
     - First operation: `i = 1`, insert `2 + 1 = 3`, delete `2`.
     - Second operation: `i = 1`, insert `1 + 1 = 2`, delete `1`.
     - Set `S` = `{3, 2}`, sorted in reverse order: `[3, 2]`.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `5`
     - `1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000`
   - Expected Output: `1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2`
   - Explanation:
     - Each operation selects the last element, ensuring the highest possible values are inserted first.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3`
     - `6 4 8`
   - Expected Output: `11 7 6`
   - Explanation:
     - Operations: 
       - First: `i = 0`, insert `6 + 1 = 7`, delete `6`.
       - Second: `i = 1`, insert `4 + 2 = 6`, delete `4`.
       - Third: `i = 2`, insert `8 + 3 = 11`, delete `8`.
     - Set `S` = `{11, 7, 6}`, sorted in reverse order: `[11, 7, 6]`.

### Conclusion
The program correctly processes the input and constructs the lexicographically largest possible array `b` by ensuring the set `S` contains unique values and sorting them in reverse order. The logic for constructing `ans` ensures minimal differences between consecutive elements.

**Correctness: True**
