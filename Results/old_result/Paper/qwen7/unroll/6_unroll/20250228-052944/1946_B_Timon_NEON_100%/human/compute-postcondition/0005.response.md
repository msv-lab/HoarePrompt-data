Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(len(arr))`. The objects involved here are `i` and `len(arr)`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is the loop variable, and it starts from 0 in the first iteration.
   - `len(arr)` is the length of the list `arr`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < len(arr)`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0, the loop will execute if `len(arr)` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `len(arr)` is at least 1 so that the loop can execute.
   - The value of `i` is not critical at the start since it will be set to 0 in the first iteration.

5. **State the final adjusted state**:
   - `max_sum` is -1 (unchanged).
   - `arr` is a list of integers (unchanged).
   - `new_segment` is an empty list (unchanged).
   - `max_segment` is [0, 0] (unchanged).
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list (unchanged).
   - `len(arr)` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**`max_sum` is -1, `arr` is a list of integers, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `len(arr)` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**.

However, since the question asks us to focus only on the objects in the loop head, we only need to adjust `len(arr)` and `i`:

**`len(arr)` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**.
