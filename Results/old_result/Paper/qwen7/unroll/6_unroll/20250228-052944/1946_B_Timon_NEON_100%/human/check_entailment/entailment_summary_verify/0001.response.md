### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly calculates the remainder of `number` when divided by \(10^9 + 7\). It ensures that the result fits within the required modulo constraint. This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Let's analyze the function step-by-step:
   - The function aims to find the maximum sum subarray, but its implementation has significant issues:
     - The variable `new_segment` is initialized but never updated properly. It should be used to accumulate the sum of the current segment being considered.
     - The variable `max_segment` is also initialized but not updated correctly. It should keep track of the maximum sum found so far.
     - The logic for handling negative and positive elements is flawed. For example, if a negative element is encountered, it should not simply add it to `max_segment` but rather consider the possibility of starting a new segment.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` without ensuring they are updated correctly. This results in incorrect tracking of segments.
     - The final loop to determine the `total_max_segment` is problematic because it doesn't handle the case where the maximum segment might be the entire array or a single element.

2. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: The function is not implemented at all, which means it cannot contribute to solving the problem. However, based on the provided summary, it appears that the function is supposed to return `0` if `number` is less than or equal to `quantity`, otherwise it returns `number`. This logic is correct and should be implemented in the main solution.

Given these observations, the original assessment correctly identified that the logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect and that the third function is missing. However, the original assessment did not account for the fact that the logic for handling the maximum sum subarray can be improved and that the third function, although not implemented, could potentially be correctly implemented with the given logic.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified that the logic for finding the maximum sum subarray is incorrect and that the third function is missing. However, the original assessment did not fully recognize that the logic for handling the maximum sum subarray can be improved and that the third function, although not implemented, could potentially be correctly implemented with the given logic. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is still questionable due to the unimplemented and incorrect logic.

**Final: False**
