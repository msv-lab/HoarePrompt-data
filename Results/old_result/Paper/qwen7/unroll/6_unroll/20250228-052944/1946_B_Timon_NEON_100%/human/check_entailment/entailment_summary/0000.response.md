Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - **Operation Effectiveness**: Inserting the sum of a subarray can significantly increase the array's sum, especially if the subarray has a high positive sum.
   - **Max Segment Calculation**: The `func_2` function aims to find the segment with the maximum sum. However, the current implementation seems flawed because it doesn't correctly track the maximum sum segment.
   - **Final Sum Calculation**: The `answer` is calculated as `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`. This formula suggests that the segment's sum is doubled `k` times and added to the original sum, minus the segment's sum itself. This logic seems incorrect because it doesn't account for the optimal placement of the segment's sum in the array.

3. **Review of `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to find the segment with the maximum sum but does not handle negative sums correctly. It should consider the maximum sum segment regardless of whether it is positive or negative.
   - The function does not ensure that the segment with the highest sum is selected, which is crucial for maximizing the array's sum.

4. **Review of `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the remainder when dividing by \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Review of `func_3`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided code, so it is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

6. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the final sum (`answer`) is flawed. It does not correctly account for the optimal placement of the segment's sum in the array.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the array's sum after `k` operations.

Correctness: **False**
