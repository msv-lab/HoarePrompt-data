### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations.
   - Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The optimal strategy involves maximizing the sum of the array by repeatedly adding the largest possible subarray sums.
   - The initial sum of the array plus the sum of the largest subarray multiplied by \( 2^k \) gives the maximum possible sum.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the remainder when dividing by \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **func_2**: This function finds the segment with the maximum sum. However, the logic seems flawed because it does not handle negative sums correctly and does not account for the possibility of using an empty subarray.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code and thus irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

4. **Code Execution**:
   - The main logic is in the main part of the code:
     ```python
     max_segment = func_2(a)
     if max_segment[0] == -1:
         max_segment[0] = 0
     answer = max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]
     print(func_1(answer))
     ```
   - The logic here assumes that `func_2` provides the maximum sum segment, but since `func_2` might not work correctly, we need to verify if the overall approach is sound.

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples show that the code handles various edge cases and large inputs correctly.
   - However, the key issue lies in `func_2`. If `func_2` does not correctly identify the maximum sum segment, the result will be incorrect.

Given the provided annotations and the examples, the core logic of the code seems to be correct if `func_2` works as intended. However, `func_2` has issues with handling negative sums and may not always return the correct segment.

### Conclusion:

Since `func_2` is not correctly implemented and may not always provide the correct maximum sum segment, the overall correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.

**Correctness: **False**
