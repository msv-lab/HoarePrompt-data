Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are defined, but `func_3` is incomplete and does not address the core logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires performing exactly `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array, but the provided code does not include any logic to handle these operations.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```

Expected output:
```
-1
```

However, the current implementation does not provide a mechanism to perform the required operations to maximize the sum. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find a segment with the maximum sum, which is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
