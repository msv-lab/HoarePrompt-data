Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the array is already in a non-increasing order using the `func_1` function. If it is, the program prints 0 because no rearrangement is needed. Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

However, the logic in the `func_1` function is incorrect. It checks if the array is in non-increasing order, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the maximum beauty by rearranging the elements, not checking if they are in a specific order.

To find the maximum beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This approach ensures that the differences are maximized.

Given this, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore:

Correctness: **False**
