### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: The function starts by setting the first element of the row to 1.
2. **Initial Setup**: It then increments the first `d` elements by 2, making them 3.
3. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap is initialized using the first `d` elements of the row.
4. **Main Loop**: The main loop processes the remaining elements of the row starting from index `d`. For each element, it pops the smallest element from the heap whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. It then updates the current element by adding the popped element's value plus one and pushes both the updated value and the original value back into the heap.
5. **Return Statement**: The function returns the last element of the processed row.

The key issue here is that the function does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Instead, it seems to be trying to minimize the cost by incrementing elements based on the smallest values in the heap, which does not necessarily satisfy the distance constraint.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads the dimensions of the river and the depths of each cell for each row.
2. **Cost Calculation**: It calls `func_1` for each row to calculate the cost of placing supports according to the constraints.
3. **Total Cost Calculation**: It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum cost among these sets.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the overall approach in `func_2` is flawed because it relies on an incorrect cost calculation method.

#### Example Input Analysis:
Consider the example input provided in the problem statement:
```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 1 2 0
0 1 2 0
```

The correct solution involves placing supports at positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), (3,3), resulting in a total cost of 6. However, the provided function might incorrectly place supports, leading to a higher cost. For instance, it might place supports at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), which would violate the distance constraint `d = 2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`, and the function `func_2` relies on an incorrect cost calculation method.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
