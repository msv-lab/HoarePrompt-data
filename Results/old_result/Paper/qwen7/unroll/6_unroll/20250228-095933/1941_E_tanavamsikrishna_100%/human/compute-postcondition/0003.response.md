Output State: **`costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row; `total_costs` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `total_costs`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of these variables, with `total_costs` being initialized as an empty list.
