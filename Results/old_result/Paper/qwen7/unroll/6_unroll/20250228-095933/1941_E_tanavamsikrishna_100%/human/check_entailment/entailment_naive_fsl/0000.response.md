Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem's constraints. The function aims to minimize the cost of supports within a row, but it does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Additionally, the function does not properly account for the requirement that a support must be installed in both the first and last columns of the row.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 1 2 0
0 1 2 0
```

The correct solution would involve placing supports at positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), (3,3), resulting in a total cost of 6. However, the provided function might incorrectly place supports, leading to a higher cost. For instance, it might place supports at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), which would violate the distance constraint `d = 2`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
