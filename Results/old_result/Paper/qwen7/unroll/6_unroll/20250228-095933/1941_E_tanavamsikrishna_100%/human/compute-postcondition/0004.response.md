Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head mentions `i` and `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`.
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values of the integers inputted separated by spaces.
   - `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row.
   - `total_costs` is an empty list.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and increment `i` until `i` is no longer less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `len(costs) - (k - 1)`. Initially, `i` is 0, so `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0.
   - Therefore, `len(costs)` must be greater than `k - 1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.
   - The condition `i < len(costs) - (k - 1)` must hold true for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being 0 and `len(costs) - (k - 1)` being greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(costs) - (k - 1)` must be greater than 0**
