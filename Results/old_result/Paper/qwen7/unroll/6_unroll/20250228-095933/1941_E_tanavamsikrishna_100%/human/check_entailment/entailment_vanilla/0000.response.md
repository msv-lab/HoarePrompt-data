Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function aims to calculate the minimum cost to place supports under a single row of the river such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Set the first support at the start of the row.
   - For the next `d-1` positions, add an extra cost of 2 to account for the additional support needed to meet the distance constraint.

2. **Heap Initialization**:
   - Create a min-heap with the initial segment of the row up to index `d`.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - For each subsequent position in the row, pop the smallest cost from the heap.
   - If the popped position is too far (greater than `d` units away from the current position minus 1), ignore it.
   - Otherwise, update the current position's cost to the popped cost plus the current cell's depth plus 1 (for the new support).
   - Push the updated cost back into the heap.

4. **Return the Last Cost**:
   - Return the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to place supports in the entire row.

#### Function `func_2`
This function processes the input and calculates the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges over `k` consecutive rows.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - Read the dimensions and parameters of the river.
   - Read the depths of each row.

2. **Calculate Costs**:
   - Use `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost for each row.

3. **Calculate Total Costs**:
   - For each possible starting row for the first bridge, calculate the total cost of placing `k` bridges consecutively.
   - Keep track of the minimum total cost.

4. **Output the Result**:
   - Print the minimum total cost.

### Correctness Check

1. **Heap Usage**:
   - The heap is used correctly to efficiently find the minimum cost within the required distance constraint.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation logic in `func_1` is sound and ensures that the distance constraint is met.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is implemented correctly to ensure the minimum cost is found.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic in `func_2` is correct. It iterates through all possible starting rows for the first bridge and calculates the minimum total cost.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the steps outlined.

### Conclusion

**Correctness: True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost for placing `k` bridges over `k` consecutive rows of the river.
