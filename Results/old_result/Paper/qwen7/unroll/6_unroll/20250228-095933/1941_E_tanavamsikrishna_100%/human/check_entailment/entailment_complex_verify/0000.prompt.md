You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bernard loves visiting Rudolf, but he is always running late. The problem is
that Bernard has to cross the river on a ferry. Rudolf decided to help his
friend solve this problem.

The river is a grid of n rows and m columns. The intersection of the i -th row
and the j -th column contains the number a_{i,j} — the depth in the
corresponding cell. All cells in the first and last columns correspond to the
river banks, so the depth for them is 0 .

The river may look like this.

Rudolf can choose the row (i,1), (i,2), \ldots, (i,m) and build a bridge over
it. In each cell of the row, he can install a support for the bridge. The cost
of installing a support in the cell (i,j) is a_{i,j}+1 . Supports must be
installed so that the following conditions are met:

  1. A support must be installed in cell (i,1) ; 
  2. A support must be installed in cell (i,m) ; 
  3. The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than d . The distance between supports (i, j_1) and (i, j_2) is |j_1 - j_2| - 1 . 

Building just one bridge is boring. Therefore, Rudolf decided to build k
bridges on consecutive rows of the river, that is, to choose some i (1 \le i
\le n - k + 1 ) and independently build a bridge on each of the rows i, i + 1,
\ldots, i + k - 1 . Help Rudolf minimize the total cost of installing
supports.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , m , k , and d (1
\le k \le n \le 100 , 3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le d \le m ) — the number
of rows and columns of the field, the number of bridges, and the maximum
distance between supports.

Then follow n lines, i -th line contains m positive integers a_{i, j} (0 \le
a_{i, j} \le 10^6 , a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0 ) — the depths of the river cells.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n \cdot m for all sets of input data does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum total cost of
supports installation.

Note

In the first test case, it is most profitable to build a bridge on the second
row.

It is not a top view, but side view: gray cells — bridge itself, white cells
are empty, black cells — supports, blue cells — water, brown cells — river
bottom.

In the second test case, it is most profitable to build bridges on the second
and third rows. The supports will be placed in cells (2, 3) , (3, 2) , and on
the river banks.

In the third test case the supports can be placed along the river banks.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the elements of `row` starting from index `d`. For each iteration, it pops the smallest element from `min_heap` whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`, then updates the current element in `row` by adding the popped element's value plus one, and pushes both the updated value and the original value back into `min_heap`. This process continues until `min_heap` is empty, resulting in an empty `min_heap` and each element in `row` being incremented by 2 (initially 1 + 1 for the first element and 3 + 1 for the rest).
    return row[-1]
    #The program returns 6
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `row` representing the depths of river cells in a single row and a positive integer `d` representing the maximum allowed distance between adjacent supports. It modifies the `row` list by setting the first element to 2 and each subsequent element up to the length of `row` to 4. Additionally, it uses a min-heap to track the minimum values within a sliding window of size `d+2`. After processing, the function returns the last element of the modified `row` list, which is 6.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, m, k, d) are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells for each row. The first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.

    #State: Output State: `total_costs` is a list containing the sum of every consecutive sublists of `costs` with a length of `k`. Each element in `total_costs` represents the sum of `k` consecutive elements from `costs`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: the minimum value among all the sums of k consecutive elements in costs
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integers \( n \), \( m \), \( k \), and \( d \), along with a list of \( n \) lists named `rows`. Each inner list contains \( m \) positive integers representing the depths of river cells. The function calculates the sum of every consecutive sublist of length \( k \) within the list `costs`, which is derived from `rows` using `func_1` with parameter \( d \). Finally, it returns the minimum value among all these sums.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem's constraints. The function aims to minimize the cost of supports within a row, but it does not ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. Additionally, the function does not properly account for the requirement that a support must be installed in both the first and last columns of the row.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
3 4 1 2
0 1 2 0
0 1 2 0
0 1 2 0
```

The correct solution would involve placing supports at positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,1), (3,3), resulting in a total cost of 6. However, the provided function might incorrectly place supports, leading to a higher cost. For instance, it might place supports at (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), which would violate the distance constraint `d = 2`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
