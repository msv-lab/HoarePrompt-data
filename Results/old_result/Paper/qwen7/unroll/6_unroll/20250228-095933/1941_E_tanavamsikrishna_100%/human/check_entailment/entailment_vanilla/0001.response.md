Let's break down the solution step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows such that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`.
   - Each row has `m` columns, and the cost to install a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i,j} + 1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row.
   - It uses a min-heap to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d` apart.
   - The function initializes the first `d` elements of the row with a cost of `1` (base cost for the first support).
   - For each subsequent element, it pops the smallest cost from the heap and updates the current cost accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last element, which represents the total cost for the row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and processes it to find the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges.
   - It reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It reads the depths of each row into a list of lists called `rows`.
   - It computes the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in a list called `costs`.
   - It then iterates through the `costs` list to find the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost.

### Analysis of the Code:

1. **Heap Usage:**
   - The heap is used efficiently to maintain the minimum cost for placing supports up to a distance `d` apart.
   - This ensures that the cost calculation is optimal for each row.

2. **Cost Calculation for Rows:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for placing supports in a single row.
   - The logic inside the loop ensures that the cost is updated correctly based on the minimum cost from the heap.

3. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
   - It iterates through the `costs` list and finds the minimum total cost for the specified number of consecutive rows.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the code appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly to solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
