Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, the string `s` is now the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and the value of `s` is the input string.**

Explanation: The code `s = input()` reads an input string from the user and assigns it to the variable `s`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. The string `s` is updated to the input string provided by the user.
