Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Function `func_1` is not correctly implemented**: The function `func_1` is supposed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. However, the current implementation only checks if the first `k` characters of `s` form a sequence that includes all `k` characters. It does not verify all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Generating a counterexample**: The program attempts to generate a counterexample by appending the missing character from `us` (the set of first `k` lowercase English alphabets) to the answer string `ans` and filling the rest with 'a'. This approach is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the generated string is a valid subsequence of `s`.

3. **Logic for checking subsequences**: The logic to check if a string of length `n` is a subsequence of `s` is missing. The current implementation only checks if the first `k` characters of `s` include all characters from `us`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

rrr = randint(8888, 88888)
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set((chr(i + 97) for i in range(k)))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
    if ps >= n:
        return print('YES')
    print('NO')
    # Generate a counterexample
    counter_example = ''
    for i in range(n):
        if i < len(ans):
            counter_example += ans[i]
        else:
            counter_example += chr(randint(97, 97 + k - 1))
    print(counter_example)

```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly checks if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`, and if not, generates a counterexample.
