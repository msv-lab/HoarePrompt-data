Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in s:`. This means the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the value of each character in the string `s` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `s`: This is the input string of length `m` comprising only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on the value of each character in `s`, we need to ensure that `s` is properly initialized as a string of length `m` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `i` will start as the first character of `s` in the first iteration of the loop.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` should be a string of length `m` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `i` should be the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, `win` is an empty list, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0, `i` is the first character of `s`**.
