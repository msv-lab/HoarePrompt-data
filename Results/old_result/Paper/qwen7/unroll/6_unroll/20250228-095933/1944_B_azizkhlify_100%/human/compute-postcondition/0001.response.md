Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each representing the results of a test case. For each test case, it first prints pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list `a` until `k` pairs are printed or all such pairs are exhausted. Then, it prints any remaining single occurrences of numbers from the first half of the list `a` until `k` numbers are printed or all such numbers are exhausted. Finally, it prints any pairs of numbers from the second half of the list `a` that appear exactly twice until the counts of pairs from both halves match. Numbers are printed in the order they are found.
