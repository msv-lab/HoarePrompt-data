Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b`. It returns `a * b // gcd(a, b)`, which is equivalent to `lcm(a, b)`.
   - **func_2()**: This function processes the input for each test case.
     - It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
     - It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all multipliers using `func_1`.
     - It then calculates a list of values `vprod` where each element is the LCM divided by the corresponding multiplier.
     - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from the LCM to get `den`.
     - If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists.
     - Otherwise, it prints the values in `vprod`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the LCM of all multipliers.
   - It then distributes the coins in a way that ensures the total bet is less than the amount received back for each outcome.
   - The use of LCM ensures that the distribution is optimal and meets the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
