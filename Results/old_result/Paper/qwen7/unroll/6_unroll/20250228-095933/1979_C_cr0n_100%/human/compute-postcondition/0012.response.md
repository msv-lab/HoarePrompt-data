Based on the initial state provided:

- `den` is the result of `den - sum(vprod)`, and `den` is greater than 0.
- `vprod` remains unchanged.

The `print` statement will execute the following code:
```python
print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
```

This code will:
1. Convert each element in the list `vprod` to a string.
2. Join these string representations with a space (' ') as the separator.
3. Print the resulting string.

Since `vprod` remains unchanged and `den` is not used in the print statement, the output will only depend on the elements of `vprod`.

Output: **what is printed (where the printed content is the elements of vprod joined by spaces)**
