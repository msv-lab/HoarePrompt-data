Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The problem allows you to change a subarray to a single value, but the current implementation only checks if adjacent elements are different and tries to find the longest sequence of identical elements from both ends. This approach does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal using at most one operation.

2. **Logic Flaw**: The logic for determining the minimum cost is flawed. Specifically, the code calculates `cn` and `ck`, which represent the lengths of sequences from the start and end, respectively, but it doesn't consider the best possible way to use the operation to minimize the cost.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution fails to handle various edge cases properly. For instance, it doesn't correctly identify the minimal cost when the array has multiple distinct segments that need to be changed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should:
- Identify the distinct segments in the array.
- Calculate the cost of changing each segment to a common value.
- Choose the segment whose change results in the minimum cost.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find all segments where the values differ
        segments = []
        i = 0
        while i < n:
            start = i
            while i < n and arr[i] == arr[start]:
                i += 1
            if i > start + 1:
                segments.append((start, i))
            i += 1
        
        # Calculate the cost for each segment
        min_cost = float('inf')
        for start, end in segments:
            cost = (end - start) * arr[start]
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
        
        # Check if the entire array can be made uniform in one operation
        if len(segments) == 0:
            min_cost = 0
        elif len(segments) == 1:
            min_cost = segments[0][1] - segments[0][0]
        else:
            min_cost = min(min_cost, segments[0][1] - segments[0][0], segments[-1][1] - segments[-1][0])
        
        print(min_cost)

func()
```

This solution identifies segments where the array values differ and calculates the cost of making each segment uniform. It then finds the minimum cost among these options.
