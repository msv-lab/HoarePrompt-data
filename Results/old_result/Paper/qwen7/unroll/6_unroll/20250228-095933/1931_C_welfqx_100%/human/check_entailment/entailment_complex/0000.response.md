Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation. The operation involves setting a subarray to a single value, and the cost is the length of the subarray.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then checks if the array has consecutive identical elements and calculates the lengths of these sequences (`cn` and `ck`).
   - Finally, it prints `n - max(cn, ck)`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for calculating `cn` and `ck` is based on the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in the original and reversed arrays.
   - The idea is to use the longest such sequence to minimize the cost of making all elements equal.
   - The cost calculation `n - max(cn, ck)` ensures that the minimal cost operation is chosen.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements in both the original and reversed arrays.
   - The cost calculation ensures that the minimal cost operation is chosen.
   - The logic handles edge cases like single-element arrays and arrays with all identical elements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
