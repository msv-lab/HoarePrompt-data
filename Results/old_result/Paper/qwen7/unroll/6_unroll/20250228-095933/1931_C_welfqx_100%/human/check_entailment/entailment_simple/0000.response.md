Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where all elements between indices \(i\) and \(j\) are set to a value \(x\). The cost of this operation is \((j - i + 1)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it checks if all elements in the array are already the same. If so, no operation is needed, and it prints 0.
   - If not, it calculates the length of the longest segment of consecutive identical elements from the start (`cn`) and from the end (`ck`) of the array.
   - If the first element of the original array is the same as the last element of the reversed array, it adds `ck` to `cn`.
   - Finally, it prints `n - max(cn, ck)`, which represents the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

3. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The logic correctly identifies if the array is already uniform (all elements the same), in which case it prints 0.
   - The calculation of `cn` and `ck` ensures that the longest segment of identical elements is considered, and the cost is minimized by choosing the shorter segment.
   - The addition of `ck` to `cn` when the first and last elements match ensures that the entire array can be made uniform in one operation if possible.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected format and values as per the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
