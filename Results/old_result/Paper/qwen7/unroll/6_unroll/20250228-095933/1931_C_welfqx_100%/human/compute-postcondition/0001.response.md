State: **`t` is an input integer, and `r` must be greater than or equal to 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `r` and the integer `t`.
- The loop `for r in range(t):` will execute as long as `r` is less than `t`.
- Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, but we don't know its value yet.
- The variable `r` starts from 0 by default when using `range(t)`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute, `r` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `t` must be a positive integer (or zero).

Since `t` is an input integer and `r` starts from 0, the state needs to ensure that `r` is initialized to 0 and `t` is a non-negative integer.
