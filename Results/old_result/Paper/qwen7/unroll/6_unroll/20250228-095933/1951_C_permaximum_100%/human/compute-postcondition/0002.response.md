Output State: **`pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `total_cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `total_cost` to 0. No changes are made to the other variables (`pq`, `n`, `m`, `k`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
