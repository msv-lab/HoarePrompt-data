Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Rules Not Followed**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it simply checks for the presence of certain indices in the array and prints them without considering the actual sequence of moves made by the players.
2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**: The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not reflect these strategic considerations.
3. **Output Mismatch**: The expected output for the given examples is the final MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. However, the program only prints intermediate indices without considering the full game process.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
