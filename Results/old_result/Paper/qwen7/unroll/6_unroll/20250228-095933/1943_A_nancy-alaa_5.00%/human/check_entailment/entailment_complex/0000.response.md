Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and the objective of finding the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Game Rules and Objective**: 
   - Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`.
   - Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and removes it from `a`.
   - Bob only removes the chosen element from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through indices from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the index is missing from the counter or if the index has appeared exactly once after some other index has also appeared once.
   - This logic does not simulate the actual game process where Alice and Bob take turns, and it does not construct the array `c` properly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice should append elements to `c` and remove them from `a`.
   - Bob should only remove elements from `a`.
   - The program needs to simulate these actions and construct the array `c` accordingly.
   - At the end, the MEX of `c` should be calculated.

Given the current implementation, the program does not correctly simulate the game or compute the MEX of `c`. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
