Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Rules Not Followed**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, Alice should pick an element from `arr` and append it to `c`, and then delete it from `arr`. Bob should only pick an element from `arr` and delete it without appending it to `c`.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX of `c` at the start, which is incorrect because `c` is not being built according to the rules of the game.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. It simply checks for the presence of numbers in `arr` and prints the first missing number, which does not reflect the dynamic nature of the game where players make strategic choices.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game properly, ensuring that Alice and Bob take their turns as described, and then compute the MEX of the resulting array `c` after the game ends.
