Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Odd `n` Values**: The solution correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, no suitable string can be formed and prints "NO". This part is correct.
   
2. **Even `n` Values**: For even `n`, the solution attempts to construct a string using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. However, this approach has limitations:
   - The constructed string will always start with 'AAB', which means the first character cannot be special since it has no left neighbor.
   - The pattern `'AAB'` ensures that every third character is special, but it does not guarantee that exactly `n` characters are special.
   - The solution does not check if the constructed string meets the requirement of having exactly `n` special characters.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the constructed string has exactly `n` special characters. One way to achieve this is by constructing a repeating pattern that ensures the required number of special characters.

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string with exactly n special characters
            s = ''
            i = 0
            while len(s) < 200 and i < n:
                if i == 0:
                    s += 'AB'
                elif i == n - 1:
                    s += 'B'
                else:
                    s += 'A'
                i += 1
            if len(s) >= 200 or i < n:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
                print(s)

func()
```

This revised solution constructs the string by ensuring that the number of special characters is exactly `n` and fits within the constraints.
