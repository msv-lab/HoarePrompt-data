Output State: `ans_list` is a list containing integers calculated from the loop's execution, where each integer represents the final value of `ans` after processing each input set of `n`, `k`, and `a`. The value of `t` is used to determine the number of times the loop runs, and for each run, `n`, `k`, and `a` are updated based on user input. After all iterations, `res` and `ans` are computed and appended to `ans_list`.
