Postcondition: `bodya_score` is the value returned by `calculate_score(PB)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, and `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is unique and within the range 1 to n, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is within the range 1 to 10^9, `sasha_score` is the value returned by `calculate_score(PS)`, and `sasha_score` is greater than `bodya_score`.
