Output State: The output state is a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression \((2^k \times \max(c) - \max(c) + \sum(l)) \mod 1000000007\) for each test case, where \(\max(c)\) is the maximum value of \(c\) calculated during the iteration over the list \(l\), and \(\sum(l)\) is the sum of all elements in the list \(l\). This process is repeated for each test case defined by the input.
