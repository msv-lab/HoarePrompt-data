Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that we can insert the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array during each operation. The current implementation only considers the maximum prefix sum of the array, which is insufficient to achieve the maximum possible sum after k operations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9
```
The program calculates the maximum prefix sum, which is 8. However, the optimal strategy would be to insert the sum of the subarray `[4, -2, 8]` (which is 10) into the array, resulting in the array `[10, -12, 9]`. The sum of this array is `10 - 12 + 9 = 7`, which is greater than the sum calculated by the program.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible subarrays and their sums, and strategically insert these sums into the array to maximize the total sum. The current implementation only considers the maximum prefix sum, which is not sufficient to achieve the maximum possible sum after k operations.
