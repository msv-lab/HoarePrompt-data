State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `i` is 0**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(n)`.
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `n` is the upper limit of the range.

2. **Determine Initial Values**:
   - `i` should start at 0 because the `range(n)` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.

3. **Adjust States**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we set `i` to 0.
   - `n` must be a positive integer, but since the problem specifies `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5`, we only need to ensure that `n` is at least 1.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 0 and `n` to be at least 1.
