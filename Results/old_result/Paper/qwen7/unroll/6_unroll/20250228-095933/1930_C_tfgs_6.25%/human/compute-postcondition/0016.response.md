Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order.
- `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is a list containing all integers from `a[0]` to the smallest integer in `a` inclusive, repeated 0 times (i.e., `ans` is an empty list).

The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans`.

Since `ans` is explicitly stated to be an empty list, the output will be an empty sequence of elements.

Output: **[]**
