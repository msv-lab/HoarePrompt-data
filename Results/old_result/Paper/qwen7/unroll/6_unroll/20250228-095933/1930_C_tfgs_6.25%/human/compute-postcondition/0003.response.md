Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` (for 0 ≤ i < min(n, len(a))) is equal to the original value of `a[i]` plus `i + 1`, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all the iterations, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be increased by `i + 1` for every iteration `i` from 0 to `n-1`. If `i` exceeds the length of the list `a`, the loop will stop executing further iterations.
