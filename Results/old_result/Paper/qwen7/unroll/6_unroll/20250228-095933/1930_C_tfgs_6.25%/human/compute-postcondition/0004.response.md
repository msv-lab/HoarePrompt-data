Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a[i]` (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by `i + 1`, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5.

In more detail, after the loop executes all the iterations, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` will be updated to `a[i] + i + 1`. The value of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
