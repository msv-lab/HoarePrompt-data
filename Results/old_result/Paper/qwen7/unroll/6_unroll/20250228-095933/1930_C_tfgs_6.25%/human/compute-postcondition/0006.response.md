Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is a list of unique integers, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5. A Counter object is created from the list `a`.**

Explanation: The line `a = list(set(a))` removes duplicate elements from the list `a` by converting it into a set and then back into a list. This means that the list `a` now contains only unique integers. All other variables (`t`, `n`, and the Counter object) remain unchanged from their initial states.
