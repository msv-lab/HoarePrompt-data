Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which is intended to solve the problem.
2. The function `func_1` first creates `Counter` objects for the sorted versions of array `b` and the initial segment of array `a` of length `m`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
4. It calculates the initial number of matching elements (`sm`) between the initial segment of `a` and `b` using the intersection of the two `Counter` objects.
5. If `sm` is already greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the initial segment is good.
6. It then iterates through the rest of the array `a` from index `m` to `n-1`. For each new element added to the window of size `m`, it updates the `Counter` object `ca` and adjusts `sm` accordingly:
   - If the new element in `a` increases the count in `ca` beyond what is in `cb`, it adds 1 to `sm`.
   - If the element being removed from the window decreases the count in `ca` to match or below what is in `cb`, it subtracts 1 from `sm`.
7. If `sm` becomes greater than or equal to `k` after any update, it increments `ans` by 1.
8. The function returns `ans` after processing all possible subsegments.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
