    #The program returns `ans`, which is the number of times `sm` reaches or exceeds `k` based on the conditions provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, and `b` is a list of `m` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function calculates the number of times the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `a` and `b` (after sorting and counting elements) reaches or exceeds `k` as it iterates through the list `a`. The function returns `ans`, which is the count of such occurrences.
