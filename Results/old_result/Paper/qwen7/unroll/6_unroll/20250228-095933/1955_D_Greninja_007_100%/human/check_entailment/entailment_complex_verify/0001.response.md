### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` is correctly defined to take the necessary parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It initializes `cb` and `ca` as `Counter` objects for the sorted versions of `b` and the initial segment of `a` of length `m`, respectively.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of good subsegments.

2. **Initial Matching Count Calculation**:
   - `sm` is calculated as the sum of the minimum counts of elements present in both `ca` and `cb` using the intersection of the two `Counter` objects.
   - If `sm` is already greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1, indicating that the initial segment is good.

3. **Sliding Window Update**:
   - The function iterates through the rest of the array `a` from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element added to the window of size `m`, it updates the `Counter` object `ca` and adjusts `sm` accordingly:
     - If the new element in `a` increases the count in `ca` beyond what is in `cb`, it adds 1 to `sm`.
     - If the element being removed from the window decreases the count in `ca` to match or below what is in `cb`, it subtracts 1 from `sm`.
   - If `sm` becomes greater than or equal to `k` after any update, `ans` is incremented by 1.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `ans` after processing all possible subsegments.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the sliding window approach correctly, ensuring that the counts are updated properly as the window slides through the array `a`.
   - The use of `Counter` objects allows for efficient counting and updating of element frequencies.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a`. The sliding window approach ensures that the counts are updated efficiently, and the conditions for determining a good subsegment are correctly applied.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
