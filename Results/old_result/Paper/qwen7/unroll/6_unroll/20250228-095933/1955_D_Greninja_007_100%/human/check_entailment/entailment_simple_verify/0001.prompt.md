You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which is intended to solve the problem.
2. The function `func_1` first creates `Counter` objects for the sorted versions of array `b` and the initial segment of array `a` of length `m`.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the number of good subsegments.
4. It calculates the initial number of matching elements (`sm`) between the initial segment of `a` and `b` using the intersection of the two `Counter` objects.
5. If `sm` is already greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the initial segment is good.
6. It then iterates through the rest of the array `a` from index `m` to `n-1`. For each new element added to the window of size `m`, it updates the `Counter` object `ca` and adjusts `sm` accordingly:
   - If the new element in `a` increases the count in `ca` beyond what is in `cb`, it adds 1 to `sm`.
   - If the element being removed from the window decreases the count in `ca` to match or below what is in `cb`, it subtracts 1 from `sm`.
7. If `sm` becomes greater than or equal to `k` after any update, it increments `ans` by 1.
8. The function returns `ans` after processing all possible subsegments.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a`.
