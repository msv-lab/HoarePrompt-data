Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The values of \( k \) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It checks two conditions using the functions `func_1`:
     - One condition uses \( n + x - 2 \).
     - The other condition uses \( n - x \).
   - These conditions are processed to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The function `func_1` is used to get all divisors of a number, which helps in determining valid \( k \) values.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly finds all divisors of a given number \( x \) and returns them in a specific order (reverse of the square root divisors followed by their corresponding divisors).

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic in the main part of the code correctly filters out the valid \( k \) values based on the conditions derived from \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The use of set ensures that each valid \( k \) value is counted only once.
   - The final count of unique valid \( k \) values is printed.

Based on the above analysis, the given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
