Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`, but the logic to determine the valid values of `k` is flawed.

Let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `n = 1000000000`, `x = 500000000`

The program attempts to find divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` and checks if they satisfy certain conditions. However, the logic to determine the valid `k` values is incorrect. The program does not correctly handle the periodicity of the settling pattern, which repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

A correct approach would involve determining the period of the settling pattern and checking if the given position `x` fits within the repeating cycle. The program fails to implement this correctly, leading to incorrect results for many inputs.

For instance, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for the given test case, whereas the correct number of valid `k` values should be calculated based on the periodicity of the settling pattern.
