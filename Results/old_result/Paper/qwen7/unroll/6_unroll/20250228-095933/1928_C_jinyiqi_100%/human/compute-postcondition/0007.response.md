The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. The function returns a list that contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, concatenated with all corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a list of its divisors, specifically those less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order followed by those greater than the square root of `x`.
