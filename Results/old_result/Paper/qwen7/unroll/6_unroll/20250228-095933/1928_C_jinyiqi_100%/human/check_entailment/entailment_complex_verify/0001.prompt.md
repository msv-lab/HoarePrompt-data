You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

        for s in sep:

    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1
    #The program returns a list that is the concatenation of `output2` (all corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`) and `output1` (all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order, followed by all corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     1. \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     2. \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - If either condition is true, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) or \( n - x \).
   - It filters these divisors to find those that satisfy \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).
   - It removes duplicates using `set` and prints the length of the resulting list.

3. **Checking the Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` returns all divisors of \( x \), including both proper and improper divisors.
   - It ensures that the divisors are returned in a specific order (reversed order of factors).

4. **Verifying the Conditions:**
   - The conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) ensure that \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - These even numbers are used to find possible \( k \) values by checking the divisors.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where \( n \) and \( x \) might not directly give valid \( k \) values but still checks the conditions.
   - The filtering ensures that only valid \( k \) values are counted.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the number of possible \( k \) values that fit the given constraints. The conditions and the function `func_1` are correctly applied to filter out the valid \( k \) values.
