Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a permutation that satisfies the given condition for all cases. Specifically, consider the case when `n` is even. For example, if `n = 4`, the generated permutation would be `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. This permutation does not satisfy the condition because `p_1 = 4` divides `p_3 = 2` and `p_2 = 1` divides `p_4 = 3`.

To illustrate, let's take another example where `n = 6`:
- The generated permutation would be `[6, 1, 4, 2, 5, 3]`.
- Here, `p_1 = 6` divides `p_3 = 4` and `p_2 = 1` divides `p_4 = 2`.

Thus, the program fails to generate a valid permutation for even values of `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
