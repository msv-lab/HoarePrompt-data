Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy the condition that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).
2. The provided solution generates a permutation by filling even indices with decreasing even numbers starting from \( n \) down to 2, and odd indices with increasing even numbers starting from 1 up to \( n-1 \) if \( n \) is odd, or \( n+1 \) if \( n \) is even.
3. This approach ensures that the generated permutation meets the problem's requirements because:
   - Even indices will always contain even numbers, and odd indices will always contain either odd or another set of even numbers.
   - Given the specific pattern, it is highly unlikely that any two numbers \( p_i \) and \( p_j \) (where \( i \neq j \)) would satisfy the divisibility condition due to the alternating pattern of even and odd/even numbers.
4. The code correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of each permutation, and it generates and prints the required permutation for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
