### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) exist where \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation.
   - It initializes an array `p` of size \( n \) with zeros.
   - It then fills the array in a specific pattern:
     - For even indices (starting from 0), it assigns values starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2.
     - For odd indices (starting from 1), it assigns values starting from \( 1 + n \% 2 \) and incrementing by 2.

3. **Checking the Pattern**:
   - Let's consider an example for \( n = 4 \):
     - The array `p` starts as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
     - For even indices: `p[0] = 4`, `p[2] = 2`.
     - For odd indices: `p[1] = 1`, `p[3] = 3`.
     - So, the final array `p` is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.

4. **Verification**:
   - Check if the generated permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]` meets the criteria:
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_2 = 1 \).
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
     - \( p_3 = 2 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
     - \( p_1 = 4 \) does not divide \( p_3 = 2 \).
     - \( p_2 = 1 \) does not divide \( p_4 = 3 \).
   - This permutation is valid.

5. **General Case**:
   - For any \( n \), the pattern ensures that no two adjacent elements in the permutation will have the property that one divides the other because the values are assigned in a strictly increasing/decreasing manner.

However, upon closer inspection, the provided code does not guarantee that the condition \( p_i \) does not divide \( p_{i+1} \) and \( p_{i+2} \) holds for all \( i \). Specifically, the pattern used in the code does not ensure that the divisibility condition between non-adjacent elements is satisfied.

### Counterexample:
Consider \( n = 6 \):
- The array `p` would be `[6, 3, 4, 1, 5, 2]`.
- Checking the condition:
  - \( p_1 = 6 \) divides \( p_3 = 4 \) (since \( 6 \div 4 = 1.5 \), which is not an integer, but we need to check the divisibility condition for all pairs).
  - \( p_2 = 3 \) divides \( p_4 = 1 \) (since \( 3 \div 1 = 3 \)).
  - \( p_3 = 4 \) divides \( p_5 = 5 \) (since \( 4 \div 5 \) is not an integer, but we need to check all pairs).

This permutation does not satisfy the condition for all pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly generate a permutation that satisfies the given conditions for all \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
