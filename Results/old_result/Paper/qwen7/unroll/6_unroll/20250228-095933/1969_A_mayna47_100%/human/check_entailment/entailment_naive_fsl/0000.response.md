Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where no pair of friends are each other's best friends. For example, consider the input:

```
3
4
1 2 3 4
```

In this case, no friend is the best friend of another friend, so the minimum number of invitations needed should be 4 (one to each friend). However, the current implementation only prints 2, which is incorrect. This indicates that the program needs to check if there are any pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and handle the case where no such pairs exist.
