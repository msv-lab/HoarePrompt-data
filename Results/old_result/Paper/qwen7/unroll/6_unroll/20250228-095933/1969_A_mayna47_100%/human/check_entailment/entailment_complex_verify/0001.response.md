### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations Monocarp must send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `v`.
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.

3. **Function `func_1()` Analysis:**
   - Initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it with the input values.
   - Iterates through each friend to check if the friend and their best friend form a pair where both get invited (`v[v[i]] == i`).
     - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns immediately, indicating that only 2 invitations are needed.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`, indicating that at least 3 invitations are needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where a pair of friends can be invited together correctly.
   - However, the code does not handle cases where multiple pairs might exist but only one pair is checked.

5. **Verification:**
   - The code logic seems to be missing a more comprehensive check to ensure that the minimum number of invitations is calculated correctly for all scenarios.
   - For example, if there are multiple pairs, the code currently only checks the first pair found and stops, which may not always give the optimal solution.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. It only checks for the first pair and does not account for multiple pairs or the possibility of needing more than 2 invitations if no direct pair exists.

7. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the function.
   - The function `func_1()` correctly identifies if there is a pair of friends who can be invited together, but it fails to handle cases where multiple such pairs exist.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of invitations needed for all test cases. It only checks for the first pair and does not account for multiple pairs or the possibility of needing more than 2 invitations if no direct pair exists.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem for all possible test cases. It needs to check for multiple pairs and ensure the minimum number of invitations is calculated accurately.

### Final:
**False**
