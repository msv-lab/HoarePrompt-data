You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the indices for which we need to find the corresponding elements in the final array.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:

    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `array` or `result` lists in any way that would change their state from the initial empty lists. The loop iterates over `operations`, but based on the provided code, it either appends a single value to `array` or extends `array` with its own values, which doesn't change the overall state of `array` and `result` since they are not used outside the loop conditions.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over `queries`, appending elements to `result` based on the indices specified in `queries`. However, since `array` is initially an empty list, accessing any index of `array` will result in an error (IndexError), and the loop will not execute any operations on `array` or `result`. Therefore, both `array` and `result` remain empty lists after the loop completes.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list for result

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers indicating the type of operation (1 or 2) and the value x, and queries is a list of integers representing the positions k for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `t` times, for each query `k` in `queries`, the result is the value of the `k-th` element in the final array `a` after applying all operations from `operations` on an initial array of length `n`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the array to itself when the operation type is 2. Instead, it simply repeats each element of the current array `x` times, which does not match the requirement of appending `x` copies of the entire array.

For example, consider the following operations and queries:

- Operations: 
  1. Append 1 (array becomes [1])
  2. Append 1 copy of the array (array remains [1])
  3. Append 3 (array becomes [1, 3])
  4. Append 3 copies of the array (array becomes [1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 3])

- Queries: [4]

The 4th element of the final array should be 3, but the program incorrectly returns 1 because it does not properly simulate the appending of the entire array multiple times.
