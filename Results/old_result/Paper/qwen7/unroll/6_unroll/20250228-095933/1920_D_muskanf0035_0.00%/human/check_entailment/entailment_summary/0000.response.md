Reasoning:
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` to process the operations and queries.
- `func_1` is supposed to build an array based on the operations and then answer the queries by returning the appropriate elements from the array.

However, the execution summary for `func_1` indicates that it always returns an empty list regardless of the operations performed or the queries made. This behavior contradicts the problem statement and the expected functionality.

Given that `func_1` is not correctly implementing the logic to build and query the array based on the operations, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
