Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.

Explanation: The loop iterates over `queries`, appending the same value from `array` (which is initially empty) to `result`. Since `array` is empty, accessing any index of `array` will result in an empty list being appended to `result`. This operation does not change the state of `array` or `result` in a way that would differ from their initial states. Therefore, both `array` and `result` remain empty after the loop completes.
