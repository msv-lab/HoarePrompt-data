You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of operations, operations is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value), and queries is a list of positive integers representing the indices for which we need to find the corresponding elements in the final array.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `array` or `result` lists in any way that would change their state from the initial empty lists. The loop iterates over `operations`, but based on the provided code, it either appends a single value to `array` or extends `array` with its own values, which doesn't change the overall state of `array` and `result` since they are not used outside the loop conditions.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over `queries`, appending elements to `result` based on the indices specified in `queries`. However, since `array` is initially an empty list, accessing any index of `array` will result in an error (IndexError), and the loop will not execute any operations on `array` or `result`. Therefore, both `array` and `result` remain empty lists after the loop completes.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list for result
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes `n` operations on an array and then returns an empty list.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns an empty list for result


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
