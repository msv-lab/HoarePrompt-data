The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of operations), `operations` (a list of operations where each operation is a list containing the type of operation and its value), and `queries` (a list of positions for which the final array values are needed). It returns a list of integers representing the values at the specified positions in the final array after performing all the operations.
