Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and then determining the bets based on the LCM. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
3
5 5 5
```
- Expected Output:
```
-1
```
- Actual Output:
```
125 125 125 
```
In this case, the program calculates the LCM of `[5, 5, 5]` which is `5`. It then calculates the bets as `5 // 5`, `5 // 5`, and `5 // 5`, resulting in `125` for each bet. The total bet is `375`, but the amount received for each winning outcome is `5 * 125 = 625`, which is indeed greater than `375`. However, the program incorrectly outputs a valid distribution of bets instead of `-1`.

The program fails to handle cases where the calculated bets do not satisfy the condition that the total bet must be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
