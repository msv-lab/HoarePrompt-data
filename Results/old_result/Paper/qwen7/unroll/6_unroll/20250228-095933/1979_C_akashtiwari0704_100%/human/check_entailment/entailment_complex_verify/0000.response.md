### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The program calculates the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then distributes the bets based on this LCM.
2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If true, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the bets.
3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: Given as part of the problem statement.
   - **Test Case 2**: Given as part of the problem statement.
   - **Additional Test Case**: Provided in the original assessment.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Test Case 1 (Problem Statement)**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     3
     3 2 7
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     27 41 12 
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     27 41 12 
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - The LCM of `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`.
     - The bets are calculated as `42 // 3 = 14`, `42 // 2 = 21`, and `42 // 7 = 6`.
     - The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than `42 * 3 = 126`, `42 * 2 = 84`, and `42 * 7 = 294`.
     - The program correctly outputs the bets.

2. **Test Case 2 (Problem Statement)**:
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     3 3
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     1 1 
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     1 1 
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - The LCM of `[3, 3]` is `3`.
     - The bets are calculated as `3 // 3 = 1` and `3 // 3 = 1`.
     - The total bet is `1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than `3 * 1 = 3`.
     - The program correctly outputs the bets.

3. **Additional Test Case (Original Assessment)**:
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     3
     5 5 5
     ```
   - Expected Output:
     ```
     -1
     ```
   - Actual Output:
     ```
     125 125 125 
     ```
   - Explanation:
     - The LCM of `[5, 5, 5]` is `5`.
     - The bets are calculated as `5 // 5 = 1` and `5 // 5 = 1` and `5 // 5 = 1`.
     - The total bet is `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`, which is less than `5 * 1 = 5`.
     - The program incorrectly outputs the bets instead of `-1`.

From the analysis, we see that the program fails to handle the case where the calculated bets do not satisfy the condition that the total bet must be strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. Specifically, the program should output `-1` for the additional test case, but it outputs the bets instead.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the calculated bets do not satisfy the required condition.

**Final: False**
