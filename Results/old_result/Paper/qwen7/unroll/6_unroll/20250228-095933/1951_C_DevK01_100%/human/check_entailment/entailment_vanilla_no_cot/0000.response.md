Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Ticket Purchases:**
   - The logic for purchasing tickets and updating the prices is flawed. The solution assumes that tickets can be purchased in bulk without considering the cumulative effect of increasing prices.
   - The current implementation does not correctly simulate the scenario where buying tickets on a certain day affects the price of tickets on subsequent days.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - Sorting the prices array `M` does not help in determining the optimal strategy for purchasing tickets. The order of prices needs to be considered dynamically based on the number of tickets being purchased and the resulting price increases.

3. **Calculation of Cost:**
   - The calculation of the cost does not accurately reflect the dynamic nature of ticket prices after each purchase. The current approach does not properly account for the increase in ticket prices after each purchase.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use a more dynamic programming or greedy approach to minimize the cost while respecting the constraints. Here's a high-level outline of how to approach the problem:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - Use a DP table to keep track of the minimum cost to buy a certain number of tickets up to each day.
   - For each day, consider buying a certain number of tickets and update the DP table accordingly.

2. **Greedy Strategy:**
   - Prioritize buying tickets on days with lower prices to minimize the overall cost.
   - Ensure that the number of tickets bought on any given day does not exceed the limit `m`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        prices = list(map(int, input().split()))

        dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        for i in range(n):
            new_dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
            for j in range(k + 1):
                if j > 0:
                    new_dp[j] = min(new_dp[j], dp[j - 1] + prices[i] * min(j, m))
                if j < k:
                    new_dp[j] = min(new_dp[j], dp[j] + prices[i] * min(j + 1, m))
            dp = new_dp

        print(dp[k])

func()
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets, considering the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought each day and the increasing prices.
