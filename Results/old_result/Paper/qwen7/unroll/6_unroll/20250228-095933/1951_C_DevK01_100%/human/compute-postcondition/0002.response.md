Output State: **After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the output state will consist of `t` printed costs, each calculated based on the specific inputs provided for each iteration. The cost is determined by sorting the second input list `M`, selecting the first `q` elements where `q` is the ceiling of `k/m`, and then calculating the cost according to the given conditions. Each iteration modifies `n`, `m`, `k`, and `N` based on the input lists `L` and `M`.**
