Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It attempts to increment the count and calculate some values related to `g`, but it doesn't correctly account for the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

2. **Misunderstanding the Condition**:
   - The key condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is not properly handled. The current implementation does not check this condition for every pair \((a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Increment Logic**:
   - The increment logic inside the `while` loop is not aligned with the problem requirements. Specifically, the way `ans` is updated does not reflect the actual count of valid pairs.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if they satisfy the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count. This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.
