Reasoning:
The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case and calculating the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the logic used in the code is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `g` and the subsequent update of `ans` do not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The provided solution seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs by incrementally checking values of \(b\) up to \(m\) and calculating a value for \(a\) based on the current \(b\). This approach is incorrect because it does not properly account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd).

To correctly solve the problem, one should use a more appropriate algorithm that involves iterating through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the gcd condition directly. A correct implementation would involve using properties of gcd and iterating through potential values of \(a\) and \(b\) to count valid pairs.

Given the flaws in the logic and the incorrect implementation of the condition, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
