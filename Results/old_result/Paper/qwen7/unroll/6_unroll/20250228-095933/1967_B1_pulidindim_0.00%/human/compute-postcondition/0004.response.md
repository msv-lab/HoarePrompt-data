Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 are met and if the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^6. The function returns a result based on these conditions for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing two integers n and m. It verifies that both n and m are within the specified range and ensures the cumulative total of n and m across all test cases does not exceed the limit. Based on these validations, the function provides a specific output for each test case.
