### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the problem statement to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Key Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `g`:**
   - The variable `g` is defined as `n / count`, which is not directly related to the problem's requirements.
   - The logic inside the while loop does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Incorrect Increment Logic:**
   - The increment logic `ans += g / count + 1` is not aligned with the problem's constraints and conditions.

3. **Lack of Proper GCD Calculation:**
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), which is crucial for determining the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Here is a more accurate approach:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This approach iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition using the GCD. It is more straightforward and aligns with the problem's requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The provided solution does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
