The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `total_max_segment`. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, it returns \([-1]\); otherwise, it returns `total_max_segment` unchanged. The function identifies the longest contiguous subarray within `arr` that contains non-negative elements and calculates its sum. It then selects the subarray with the maximum starting index among those with the highest sum.
