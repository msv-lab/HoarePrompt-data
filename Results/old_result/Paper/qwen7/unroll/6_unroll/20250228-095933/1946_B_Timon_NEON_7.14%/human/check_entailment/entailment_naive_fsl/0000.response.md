Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program includes functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but `func_3` is incomplete and does not address the main task of calculating the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations.

The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of the array after performing k operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. However, the provided code does not handle this logic at all. Instead, it seems to be attempting to find the maximum sum subarray, which is not sufficient for solving the problem as described.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```
The correct approach would involve inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times to maximize the sum. However, the current implementation does not account for this strategy. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
