### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to maximize the sum of an array after performing \( k \) operations.
- Each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.
- The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after \( k \) operations, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

#### Provided Code:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   ```python
   def func_1(number):
       return number % 1000000007
   ```
   This function simply returns the number modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is used to ensure the result fits within the required constraints.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   ```python
   def func_2(arr):
       new_segment = []
       max_segment = [0, 0]
       segments_variants = []
       max_sum = -1
       for i in range(len(arr)):
           if new_segment:
               if arr[i] < 0:
                   if max_segment[0] > new_segment[0]:
                       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [i - 1])
                   else:
                       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [i - 1])
                       max_segment = new_segment
                   new_segment = []
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
               else:
                   max_segment[0] += arr[i]
                   new_segment[0] += arr[i]
           else:
               if arr[i] >= 0:
                   new_segment = [arr[i], i]
               max_segment[0] += arr[i]
       segments_variants.append(max_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       segments_variants.append(new_segment + [len(arr) - 1])
       total_max_segment = [-1]
       for segment in segments_variants:
           if total_max_segment[0] < segment[0]:
               total_max_segment = segment
       if len(total_max_segment) == 1:
           total_max_segment = [-1]
       return total_max_segment
   ```
   This function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it does not seem to be relevant to the problem since we need to maximize the sum by inserting sums of subarrays, not just finding the maximum sum subarray.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
   ```python
   def func_3(number, quantity):
       answer = 0
   ```
   This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations based on `number` and `quantity`.

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1:** Returns the number modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
- **Function 2:** Finds the maximum sum subarray.
- **Function 3:** Initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The main issue is that it does not handle the logic of inserting the sum of subarrays into the array to maximize the sum. Instead, it focuses on finding the maximum sum subarray, which is not sufficient.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```
- The correct approach would be to insert the sum of the entire array twice:
  - Initial array: \([-1, -2, -3]\)
  - After first insertion: \([-1, -2, -3, -6]\)
  - After second insertion: \([-1, -2, -3, -6, -12]\)
  - Maximum sum: \(-1 + -2 + -3 + -6 + -12 = -24\)

However, the current implementation does not handle this logic and instead focuses on finding the maximum sum subarray, which is not the correct approach.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

**Final: False**
