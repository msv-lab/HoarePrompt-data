State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is used as the upper limit for the `range(t)` function in the for loop.
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
- Additionally, since `t` is constrained to be between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive), this range ensures that the loop will run for a valid number of iterations.
- No other variables are involved in the loop head, so no other states need to be adjusted.
