#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise; the third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        a1 = s1.count('1')
        
        a2 = s2.count('1')
        
        hd = a1 - a2
        
        res = abs(a1 - a2)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if hd > 0:
                hd -= 1
                continue
            if s1[i] == '1' and s2[i] == '0':
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `res` after all iterations of the loop have finished, which represents the maximum number of positions where the two binary strings `s1` and `s2` can differ such that the count of '1's in `s1` is made equal to the count of '1's in `s2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \) indicating the current cat presence in boxes, and another binary string \( f \) of length \( n \) indicating the desired cat presence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of positions where the actual and desired cat presence can differ while ensuring the total number of '1's (cats) in both strings are equal.
