### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The result should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to consider the largest positive sums from the initial array and the subarrays formed during operations.
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can significantly increase the total sum, especially if the subarray has a large positive sum.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **func_1**: This function correctly computes the modulo operation, which is necessary for handling large sums.
   - **func_2**: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray(s) in the input array. However, it seems incomplete as it does not fully implement the logic to handle multiple operations and insertions.
   - **func_3**: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem as stated.

4. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - **func_2** does not fully address the problem requirements. It only finds the maximum sum subarray once and does not account for the insertion of these sums multiple times as allowed by the problem statement.
   - There is no logic to handle the `k` operations and the insertion of subarray sums into the array.
   - The function does not return the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code indicates that `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum subarray, but the logic is flawed. Specifically, it does not correctly update the `max_segment` or `segments_variants` lists, leading to incorrect results.
   - The `segments_variants` list is appended with the last index of the array, indicating that the function is not correctly identifying the maximum sum subarray.
   - The `func_3` function is completely missing the logic to compute the final result after `k` operations.

6. **Final Evaluation**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem. They do not implement the logic to handle the `k` operations and the insertion of subarray sums.
   - The annotated code confirms that the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not return the correct maximum sum subarray.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as they do not implement the logic to handle the `k` operations and the insertion of subarray sums.

**Final: False**
