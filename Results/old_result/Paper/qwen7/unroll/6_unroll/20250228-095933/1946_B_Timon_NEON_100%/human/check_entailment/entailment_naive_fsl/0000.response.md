Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the `func_3` function is incomplete and does not handle the logic required to solve the problem. The problem requires performing up to `k` operations to maximize the sum of the array by inserting the sum of any contiguous subarray at any position. However, the provided functions do not address this requirement.

Here's a brief breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incomplete Function**: The `func_3` function is defined but is not implemented to solve the problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Missing Logic**: The `func_2` function attempts to find the maximum sum subarray but does not incorporate the ability to perform up to `k` operations to further increase the sum. It only finds the maximum sum subarray once and does not consider the possibility of inserting the sum of different subarrays multiple times.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and thus is incorrect.
