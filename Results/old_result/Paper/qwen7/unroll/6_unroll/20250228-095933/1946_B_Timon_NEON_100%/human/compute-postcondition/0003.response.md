Output State: **`segments_variants` is an empty list, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_sum` to -1. This does not affect the values of `segments_variants`, `new_segment`, or `max_segment`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `max_sum` is updated to -1.
