Output State: `segments_variants` is now ['new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'], `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [len(arr) - 1]

Explanation: The loop iterates over `segments_variants`, which contains a single element 'new_segment + [len(arr) - 1]'. Inside the loop, it checks if `total_max_segment[0]` is less than the first element of the current `segment` and if the length of the segment is not 1. Since `total_max_segment` starts as [-1] and the first element of the segment is `len(arr) - 1`, which is greater than -1 (assuming `len(arr) > 1`), `total_max_segment` gets updated to `[len(arr) - 1]`. All other variables (`segments_variants`, `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop's condition or actions.
