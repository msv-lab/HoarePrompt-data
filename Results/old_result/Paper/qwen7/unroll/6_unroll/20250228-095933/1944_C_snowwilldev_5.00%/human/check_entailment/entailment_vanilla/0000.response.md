Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for finding the game's final score based on the rules described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of the array `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Excludant (MEX):**
   - The program iterates through the numbers from `0` to `N-1` and checks if there is any number `i` such that `cnt[i] == 1`. If it finds two such numbers (`t >= 2`), it prints the first such number.
   - This logic seems flawed because it doesn't consider the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Alice can always pick the smallest available number that hasn't been picked yet, and Bob will remove the next smallest number.

4. **Optimal Strategy Consideration:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, so she should always pick the smallest number that hasn't been picked yet.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX, so he should always pick the next smallest number after Alice's turn.
   - The optimal strategy would involve maintaining a sorted list of available numbers and ensuring that Alice and Bob follow their respective strategies.

### Example Analysis:

Let's consider the example provided:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
- Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[0, 0, 1]`, `c` becomes `[1]`.
- Bob picks `0`, `a` becomes `[0, 1]`, `c` becomes `[1]`.
- Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` becomes `[1, 0]`.
- Bob picks `1`, `a` becomes `[]`, `c` becomes `[1, 0]`.
- MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
- Alice picks `0`, `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`, `c` becomes `[0]`.
- Bob picks `1`, `a` becomes `[2, 3]`, `c` becomes `[0]`.
- Alice picks `2`, `a` becomes `[3]`, `c` becomes `[0, 2]`.
- Bob picks `3`, `a` becomes `[]`, `c` becomes `[0, 2]`.
- MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `2 1 1`
- Alice picks `1`, `a` becomes `[1]`, `c` becomes `[1]`.
- Bob picks `1`, `a` becomes `[]`, `c` becomes `[1]`.
- MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players. It simply counts the occurrences of each number and prints the first number that appears exactly once, which does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
