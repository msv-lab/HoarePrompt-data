Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, the output is the first index i where either the count of i in the list a is zero or the count of i is one and it's the second occurrence of such an index, or it prints the index and breaks the loop early if these conditions are met.
