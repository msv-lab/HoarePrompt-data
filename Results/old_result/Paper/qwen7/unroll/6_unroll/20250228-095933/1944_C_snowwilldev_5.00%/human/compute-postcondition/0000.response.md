Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `tc`, which is derived from `input()`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `tc`**: The variable `tc` is initialized by reading an integer from input. Since the problem specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the initial value of `tc` should be within this range.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `tc` is less than the number of test cases. The number of test cases is determined by the first input, which is stored in `tc`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `tc` is correctly set to the number of test cases. Therefore, the state before the loop starts must include the correct value for `tc`.

**State:**
- `tc` must be set to the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\).

Since the exact value of `tc` is not known until the input is read, we cannot specify a concrete value but must ensure it falls within the specified range.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tc` must be an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^4\)**
