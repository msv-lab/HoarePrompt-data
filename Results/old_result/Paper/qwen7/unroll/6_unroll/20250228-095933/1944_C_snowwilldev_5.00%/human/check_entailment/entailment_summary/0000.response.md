Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here are the key issues:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The program does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements according to the rules. Instead, it simply counts the occurrences of each integer in the array `a` and checks for specific conditions (`cnt[i] == 0` or `cnt[i] == 1`), which does not reflect the game's dynamics.

2. **Output Condition**: The program prints the first index `i` that meets the condition `cnt[i] == 0` or `cnt[i] == 1` and is the second occurrence of such an index. This does not align with the goal of determining the MEX of the array `c` formed during the game.

3. **Objective Misalignment**: The objective is to find the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, not to find an index based on the count of elements in `a`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
