Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. After executing the loop, for each test case, if there is at least one element with a count of exactly 1 in the dictionary `cnt`, the value of `t` will be incremented by 1 for each such occurrence. If `t` reaches 2 or if any element has a count of 0, the program will print the index `i` and break out of the loop. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
