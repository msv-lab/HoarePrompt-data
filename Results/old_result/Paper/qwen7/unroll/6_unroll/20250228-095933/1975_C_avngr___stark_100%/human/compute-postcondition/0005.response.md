Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a consisting of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). If n is 2, it outputs the minimum value in array a. If n is greater than 2, it finds and outputs the second largest value among all possible triplets in array a, considering only the first two elements of each triplet.**
