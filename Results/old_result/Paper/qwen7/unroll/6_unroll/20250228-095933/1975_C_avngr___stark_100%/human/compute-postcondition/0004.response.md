Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and an array a consisting of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a result based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` positive integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
