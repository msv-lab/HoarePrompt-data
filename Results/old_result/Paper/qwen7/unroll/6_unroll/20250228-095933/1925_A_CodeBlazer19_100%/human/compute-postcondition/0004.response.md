Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies that it processes values for `t`, `n`, and `k` where `t` is an integer between 1 and 676, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers between 1 and 26. The function returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function is designed to process a series of test cases, each involving three integers (`t`, `n`, and `k`) with specific ranges, and produce an output based on these values.
