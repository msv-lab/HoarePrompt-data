Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It checks if the digits satisfy the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) or a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the conditions are met, it prints the appropriate string ('STAIR' or 'PEAK').
5. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
6. The logic implemented matches the problem statement accurately.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
