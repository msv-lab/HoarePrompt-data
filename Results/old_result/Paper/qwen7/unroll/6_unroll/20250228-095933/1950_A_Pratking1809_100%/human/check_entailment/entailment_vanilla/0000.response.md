Let's analyze the given program step by step:

1. The function `func()` takes an integer `q` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates over `q` test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()`.
4. It checks if `a < b < c`. If true, it prints 'STAIR'.
5. If the previous condition is not met, it checks if `a < b > c`. If true, it prints 'PEAK'.
6. If neither of the above conditions is met, it prints 'NONE'.

Now, let's verify if this logic correctly implements the problem statement:

- A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A peak is defined as `a < b > c`.

The given program checks these conditions correctly:
- It first checks for the stair condition (`a < b < c`).
- If that condition is not met, it checks for the peak condition (`a < b > c`).
- If neither condition is met, it correctly prints 'NONE'.

Given that the program follows the exact logic specified in the problem statement, it should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
