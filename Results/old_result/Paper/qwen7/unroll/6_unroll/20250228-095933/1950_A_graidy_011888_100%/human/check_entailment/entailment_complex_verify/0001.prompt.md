You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each line of input (a, b, c) within the range of n, the output will be 'STAIR' if a < b < c, 'PEAK' if a < b and b > c, and 'NONE' otherwise. The number of lines in the output will be equal to n, and the exact content of each line will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a, b, c\) forms a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b\) and \(b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). It then prints the corresponding label for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the results directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, it correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the numbers form a stair.
   - It checks if `a < b and b > c` to determine if the numbers form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

Given the conditions specified in the problem statement:
- A stair is defined as `a < b < c`.
- A peak is defined as `a < b and b > c`.

The program's logic aligns perfectly with these definitions:
- The condition `a < b < c` directly checks for a stair.
- The condition `a < b and b > c` directly checks for a peak.

There are no logical errors or omissions in the program that would cause it to misinterpret the conditions or produce incorrect outputs based on the provided examples.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: **True**
