### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the score `ans` to 0 and reads the value of `n` and the list of integers.
3. **List Splitting**: The program splits the input string `l` into a list of strings `lst`. However, this approach is problematic because the input is already space-separated integers, and splitting it again might not work as expected. Instead, we should directly convert the input string into a list of integers.
4. **Score Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the score by repeatedly taking the minimum of the first two elements in the list and adding it to the score. It then removes these two elements from the list. This logic seems correct at first glance.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the case where the list has an odd length properly. Since `2n` integers are always provided, this should not be an issue, but the code should still be robust.
6. **Output**: The program correctly appends the final score for each test case to the list `ans_f` and prints the results at the end.

However, there is a subtle issue with the loop condition and how the list is being manipulated. The loop condition `for i in range(n * 2)` and the way elements are removed from the list might lead to incorrect behavior if the list is not handled carefully.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest elements
        lst.sort()
        
        for _ in range(n):
            ans += lst.pop(0)  # Take the smallest element
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- **Sorting the List**: Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest elements, which is necessary to maximize the score.
- **Using `pop(0)`**: Instead of manually managing the removal of elements, using `pop(0)` simplifies the process and ensures that we always remove the smallest element.

Given the above reasoning, the original program has a logical flaw due to the incorrect handling of the list elements. However, if we assume the sorting step is added, the program would be correct.

### Final Answer:

The original program, without the sorting step, is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the smallest elements are always chosen. Adding the sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are always picked, leading to the optimal solution.

**Final: False**

The original program, as given, is incorrect.
