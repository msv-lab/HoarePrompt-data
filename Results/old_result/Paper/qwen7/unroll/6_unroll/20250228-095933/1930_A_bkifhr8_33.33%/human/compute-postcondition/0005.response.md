Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the list `ans_f`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `ans_f`. 

3. **Determine the initial state needed**: For the loop to execute, the list `ans_f` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element of `ans_f` during the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the list `ans_f` having at least one element, we need to ensure that `ans_f` has at least one element. The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `ans_f` during the first iteration.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `ans_f` is a list containing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of numbers for each input case.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure `ans_f` has at least one element.

**State after adjustment**:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.
- `ans_f` must have at least one element.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000, `ans_f` must have at least one element**.
