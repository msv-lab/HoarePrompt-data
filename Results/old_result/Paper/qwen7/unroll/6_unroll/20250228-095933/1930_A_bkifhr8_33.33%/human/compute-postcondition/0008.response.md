Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and a list of numbers, and returns a result for each case based on these inputs.
