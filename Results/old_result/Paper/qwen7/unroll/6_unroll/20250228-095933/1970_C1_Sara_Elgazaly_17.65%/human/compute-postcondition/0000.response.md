Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The tree has exactly two leaves.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The conditions and relationships between `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the tree structure remain unchanged.
