Output State: **x is an integer input from the first split, y is an integer input from the second split, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has multiple elements representing the connections between nodes as defined by the input. The variable `lst` is a defaultdict(list) containing the adjacency list representation of a tree with exactly two leaves.**
