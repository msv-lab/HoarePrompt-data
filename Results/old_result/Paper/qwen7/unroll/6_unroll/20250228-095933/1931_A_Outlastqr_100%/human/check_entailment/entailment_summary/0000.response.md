Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles different ranges of `n` values to construct the lexicographically smallest word.
2. For `n > 52`, it constructs the word by adding the appropriate character to 'zz'.
3. For `27 < n <= 52`, it constructs the word by adding the appropriate character to 'az'.
4. For `n == 27`, it directly assigns 'aay'.
5. For `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by adding the appropriate character to 'aa'.
6. The program processes each test case individually and prints the resulting word, which matches the problem's requirements.

Given the execution summary and the analysis above, the program appears to be handling the logic correctly for constructing the lexicographically smallest word based on the given encoding.

Correctness: **True**
