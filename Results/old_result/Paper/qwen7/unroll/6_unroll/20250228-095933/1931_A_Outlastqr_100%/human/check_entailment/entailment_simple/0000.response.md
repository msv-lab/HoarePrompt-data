Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that encodes to a given integer \( n \).
2. The encoding method sums the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
3. The provided solution uses a series of conditional statements to construct the word based on the value of \( n \).

Let's analyze the logic of the code:
- If \( n > 52 \), it means the third letter must be beyond 'z', so the third letter is calculated as \( n - 53 \) and the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- If \( n > 27 \), the third letter is within 'a' to 'z', so the second letter is 'z' and the third letter is calculated as \( n - 28 \). The word is constructed as `a + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
- If \( n == 27 \), the word is explicitly set to 'aay'.
- Otherwise, both the second and third letters are 'z', and the first letter is calculated as \( n - 3 \). The word is constructed as `aa + alphabet[n - 3]`.

Now let's verify the examples provided in the problem statement:
- For \( n = 24 \):
  - The word should be "aav" (3 + 1 + 20 = 24).
  - The code constructs the word correctly as "aav".
- For \( n = 70 \):
  - The word should be "rzz" (18 + 1 + 26 + 26 = 71 - 1 = 70).
  - The code constructs the word correctly as "rzz".
- For \( n = 3 \):
  - The word should be "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
  - The code constructs the word correctly as "aaa".
- For \( n = 55 \):
  - The word should be "czz" (3 + 1 + 26 + 26 = 56 - 1 = 55).
  - The code constructs the word correctly as "czz".
- For \( n = 48 \):
  - The word should be "auz" (1 + 21 + 26 = 48).
  - The code constructs the word correctly as "auz".

Given the analysis, the code correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example and follows the logic to generate the lexicographically smallest word for any valid \( n \).

Correctness: **True**
