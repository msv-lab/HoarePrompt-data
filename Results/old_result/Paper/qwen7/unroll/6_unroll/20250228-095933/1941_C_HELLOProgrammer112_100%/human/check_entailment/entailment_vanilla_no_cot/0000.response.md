Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful. The logic used in the solution (counting 'map', 'pie', and 'mapie') does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to achieve the goal. For example, in the string "mappie", the current solution would count 'map' and 'pie' but not remove any characters, whereas the correct answer should be 3 (removing 'm', 'a', and 'e').
