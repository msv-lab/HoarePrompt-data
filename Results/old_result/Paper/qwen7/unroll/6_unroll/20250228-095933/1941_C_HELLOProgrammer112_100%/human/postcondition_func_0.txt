The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, a positive integer `n`, and a string `s` of length `n`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the string `s`. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression `x + y - z`, where `x` is the count of "map", `y` is the count of "pie", and `z` is the count of "mapie". The final output is a list of these results for all test cases.
