Output State: **`remaining_vertices` is a set containing elements from 1 to n inclusive, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `remaining_vertices` as a set containing all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `path` stays as an empty list.
