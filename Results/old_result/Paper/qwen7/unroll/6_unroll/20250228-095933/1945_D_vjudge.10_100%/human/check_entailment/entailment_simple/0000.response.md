Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - It then correctly parses the values of `n` and `m`, and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters. However, there is an issue here because `pergunta` is initially a string (`float('inf')`), which is incorrect. The function expects `pergunta` to be an integer, as it is used in arithmetic operations.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates over the list `a` in reverse order.
   - For each index `i` less than `m`, it updates `pergunta` to be the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`.
   - It also updates `x` to be the sum of the minimum values between `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` in the range from `n-1` to `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `pergunta`, which is the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.

Given the issues identified, particularly the initial type of `pergunta` being a string instead of an integer, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
