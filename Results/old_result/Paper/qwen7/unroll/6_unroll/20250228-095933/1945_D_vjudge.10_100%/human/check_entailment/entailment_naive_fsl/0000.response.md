Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not properly account for the cost of bribing people between Kirill and the m-th position. 

Here is an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
5 3 2
4 1 2
```

- Kirill wants to be in the first 2 positions.
- The costs are:
  - `a = [5, 3, 2]`
  - `b = [4, 1, 2]`

According to the problem description:
- To move from position 2 to position 1, Kirill pays `a[2] = 2` coins.
- For each person between position 2 and 1, Kirill pays `b[k]` coins for each `k` such that `2 > k > 1`.

The correct calculation should be:
- Moving from position 2 to position 1: `2` coins.
- No additional costs since there are no people between positions 2 and 1.

Thus, the total cost should be `2` coins.

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly. It sums up the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all positions, which does not reflect the actual cost structure described in the problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
