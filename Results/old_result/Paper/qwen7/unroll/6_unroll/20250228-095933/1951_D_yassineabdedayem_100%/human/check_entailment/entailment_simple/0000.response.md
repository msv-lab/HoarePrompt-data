Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the program prints "YES", `1` (indicating one stall), and `1` (price per jewel). This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is `1` coin each.
   - **Case 2**: When `n + 2 > k * 2`, the program prints "YES", `2` (indicating two stalls), and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is also correct because:
     - In the first stall, Alice can buy `n - k + 1` jewels, leaving her with `k - (n - k + 1) = 2k - n - 1` coins.
     - In the second stall, the price is `1` coin per jewel, so Alice can buy `k - (2k - n - 1) = n - k + 1` jewels, which matches the remaining number of jewels needed.
   - **Case 3**: For all other cases, the program prints "NO". This is correct because no combination of stalls and prices can satisfy the condition of buying exactly `k` jewels under these constraints.

3. **Output Format**: The program adheres to the required output format, printing "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly handles all the test cases according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
