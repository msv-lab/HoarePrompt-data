Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and k. For each test case, if t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and n and k are positive integers within the range 1 to 10^18, the function processes these values but does not specify what it returns.**

Note: The function description focuses on the implied input parameters (t, n, k) rather than any explicitly passed parameters since they are not listed in the function signature.
