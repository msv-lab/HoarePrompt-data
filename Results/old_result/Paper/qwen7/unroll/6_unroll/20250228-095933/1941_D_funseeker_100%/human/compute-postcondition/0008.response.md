Postcondition: **The set `ans` contains the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, where each throw can either add or subtract a random value `r` determined by `func_1()`, and the value `x` remains unchanged as the starting player. If 0 is in `ans`, then `ans` is updated to include `n` added to the possible positions in `ans`, excluding 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**
