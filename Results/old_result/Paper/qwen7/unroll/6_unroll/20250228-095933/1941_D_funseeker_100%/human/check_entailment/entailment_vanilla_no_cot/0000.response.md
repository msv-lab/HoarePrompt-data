Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the necessary inputs using custom functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) to handle reading a line, an integer, and a list of integers respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`:
   - If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), it updates the set `ans` accordingly.
   - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it considers both possible directions.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Index**: After processing all throws, it adjusts for the possibility of the ball being at position `0` by adding `n` to it.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their sorted list of positions.

The logic handles all edge cases and constraints as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
