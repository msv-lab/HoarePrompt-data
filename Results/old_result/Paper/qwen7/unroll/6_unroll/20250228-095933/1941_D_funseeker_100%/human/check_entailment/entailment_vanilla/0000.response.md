Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**: The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) that read input data in a structured way.
2. **Reading Input**: 
   - `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer.
   - `func_3` converts the result of `func_1` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`. It also initializes a set `ans` containing the starting player `x`.
3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the clockwise position `(q + r) % n`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n`.
   - The new positions are added to a temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all throws, the set `ans` is updated to `temp`.
   - If the position `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` because indices wrap around in a circular manner.
4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints these players in sorted order.

Given the problem statement and the implementation, the program correctly processes the input and calculates the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws. The logic for handling both clockwise and counterclockwise throws, including the use of `'?'`, is implemented correctly.

Correctness: **True**
