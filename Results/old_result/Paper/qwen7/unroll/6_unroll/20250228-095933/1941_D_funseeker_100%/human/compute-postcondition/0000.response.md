Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of players, `m` is an integer representing the number of throws made, `x` is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball, and `ans` is a set initialized with the player `x`. However, the actual values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are now determined by the function `func_3()`, and `ans` remains a set initialized with `x`.**

The code `n, m, x = func_3()` calls the function `func_3()`, which returns a tuple containing three values: `n`, `m`, and `x`. These values replace the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `x` from the initial state. The variable `ans` remains unchanged as it was initialized with the player `x` and is not affected by the function call.
