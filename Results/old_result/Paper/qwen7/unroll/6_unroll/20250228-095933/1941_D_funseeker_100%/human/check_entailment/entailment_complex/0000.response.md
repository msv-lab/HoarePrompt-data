### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and returns it as a string.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers split from the string.
   - `func_4()` uses these functions to process the input for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case in `func_4()`**:
   - `func_4()` correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - It iterates through each throw, updating the set `ans` based on whether the throw is clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`).
   - The modulo operation ensures that the ball wraps around the circle correctly.
   - After processing all throws, the function handles the special case where `0` might be in the set `ans` and adjusts it accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique possible positions and the sorted list of these positions.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled correctly: `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges, and the input format is validated.
   - The logic for handling the special case when `0` is in the set `ans` is implemented correctly, ensuring that `n` is added to the set if `0` is present.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the requirements: the number of possible positions followed by the sorted list of these positions.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem statement. All functions work together to process the input and produce the correct output.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
