Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**: The function `func_1` checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). However, the problem states that the array is guaranteed to be beautiful, so this check is unnecessary and misleading.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Minimum Removals**: The logic for calculating the minimum number of removals is flawed. It assumes that the array is not already uniform but does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Unnecessary Imports**: The imports for `copy`, `math`, `random`, and `decimal` are not used in the code and should be removed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest subarray where elements are the same
        max_length = 0
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if arr[i] == arr[i - 1]:
                current_length += 1
            else:
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
                current_length = 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        
        # If the entire array is uniform, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)
```

This corrected version:
- Iterates through the array to find the longest subarray where elements are the same.
- Determines if the entire array is uniform.
- Outputs `-1` if the array is uniform, otherwise outputs the number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
