Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the code has been defined but no test cases or further operations have been executed.**

The code snippet provided is a header comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would alter the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
