The function processes standard input containing multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a line, splits the line into tokens, and prints the difference between the number of unique tokens and the total number of tokens. After processing all test cases, the number of test cases remains unchanged, and for each case, the printed result is 0 since the tokens list is always empty after processing.
