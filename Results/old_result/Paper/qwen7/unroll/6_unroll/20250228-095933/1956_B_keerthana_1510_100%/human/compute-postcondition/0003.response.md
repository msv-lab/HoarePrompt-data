Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` with length `n`, where `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each integer in the list is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice. It returns information about the elements in the list based on the given constraints.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value (e.g., specific details about the elements) are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
