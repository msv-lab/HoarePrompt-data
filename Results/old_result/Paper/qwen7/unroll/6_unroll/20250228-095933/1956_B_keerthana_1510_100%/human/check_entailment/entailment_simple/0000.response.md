Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The logic in the function `func()` does not match the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, the function is attempting to calculate something related to the uniqueness of tokens in each line, which is irrelevant to the actual problem of determining the maximum number of points you can get.

The problem requires calculating the maximum number of points you can get by optimally playing the game, considering Nene's strategy to minimize your score while maximizing hers. The given code simply counts the difference between the length of split tokens and the length of unique tokens, which is not relevant to the game's scoring mechanism.

Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why the provided code is incorrect:
- The code does not handle the distribution of cards or simulate the game.
- It does not account for the strategic behavior of Nene.
- It does not compute the maximum points you can achieve based on the given constraints.

Given this analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
