Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9, `b` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= b <= 10^9, `T` is an integer input from the user.**

The code `T = int(input())` assigns the value of the integer input from the user to the variable `T`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
