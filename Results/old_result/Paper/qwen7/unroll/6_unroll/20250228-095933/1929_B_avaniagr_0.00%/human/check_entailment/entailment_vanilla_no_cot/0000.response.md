Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. 

### Key Points
- A grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals.
- We need to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- The program should output the minimum number of cells to color.

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))
```

### Explanation of the Program
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads input from standard input using `open(0)` and processes each line starting from the second line.
2. **Parsing Input**: It splits each line into two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
3. **Calculating Minimum Cells to Color**:
   - If \( k < 4n - 3 \):
     - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2)` calculates the minimum number of cells needed when \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \).
   - If \( k \geq 4n - 3 \):
     - The expression `2 * n` calculates the minimum number of cells needed when \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( 4n - 3 \).
   - Special case handling:
     - If \( k == 4n - 2 \), the expression ensures the exact count is handled correctly.

### Testing the Program
We will test the program with the provided examples to verify its correctness.
