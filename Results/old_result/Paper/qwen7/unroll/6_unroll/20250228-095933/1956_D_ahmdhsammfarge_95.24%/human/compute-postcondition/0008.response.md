Output State: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers with the sublist from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) replaced by `n` copies of `n`, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1], 0]` or `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]` and now includes `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `n` is `l - r + 1`.**

Explanation: The code replaces the sublist of `lst` from index `r` to `l` (inclusive) with `n` copies of `n`. Here, `n` is defined as `l - r + 1`. This means that the sublist of `lst` from `r` to `l` is now filled with `n` repeated `n` times. All other variables remain unchanged.
