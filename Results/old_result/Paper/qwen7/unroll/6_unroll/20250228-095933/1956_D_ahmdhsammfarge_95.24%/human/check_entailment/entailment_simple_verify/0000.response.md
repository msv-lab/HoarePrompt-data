### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its functions against the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to find the best subarray to apply the MEX operation to, but it doesn't actually compute the MEX or apply the operation. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize a different sum involving the lengths of subarrays.
- Specifically, `func_1` calculates the sum of elements before `i` and after `j` plus `(j - i + 1) ** 2` for every possible pair `(i, j)`. This is not aligned with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array elements using the MEX operation.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` recursively appends operations to the `ops` list. However, it doesn't perform any actual MEX operation or update the array `lst`. It simply appends indices to the operations list without changing the array.

#### Function `func_3`:
- The function `func_3` also doesn't perform the MEX operation. Instead, it appends operations to the `ops` list and updates the array `lst` in a way that doesn't align with the problem's requirements. It sets the sublist from `r` to `l` to a constant value, which is not the same as setting it to the MEX value of the subarray.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program starts by calling `func_1` to get the indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum according to the logic in `func_1`.
- Then, it repeatedly calls `func_3` with these indices until `r` equals `l`.
- After the loop, it tries to set all zeros to 1 in the array to further increase the sum, but this step is unnecessary and doesn't align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It fails to compute the MEX of a subarray and apply the operation to make all elements in the subarray equal to the MEX value. Instead, it attempts to maximize a different sum, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
