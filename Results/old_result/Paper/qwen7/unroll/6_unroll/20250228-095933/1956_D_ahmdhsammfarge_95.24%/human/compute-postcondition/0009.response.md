Output State: **The program returns the list `lst` where the sublist from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` (inclusive) is replaced by `n` copies of `n`.**

Explanation: The code `return lst` simply returns the list `lst` as it is. Given the initial conditions, we know that the sublist from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` in `lst` has been replaced by `n` copies of `n`. Therefore, the program returns the modified list `lst` with this specific change applied.
