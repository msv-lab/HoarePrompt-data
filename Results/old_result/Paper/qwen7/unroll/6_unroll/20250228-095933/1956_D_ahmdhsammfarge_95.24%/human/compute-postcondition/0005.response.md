Output State: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1], 0]` or `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]` and now also includes `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(r, l, ops)` updates the `ops` list to include `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The initial conditions for `r` and `l` remain unchanged, and `lst` remains a list of non-negative integers. The `ops` list is modified to include the new element `[r + 1, r + 1]`.
