Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array `a` using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
   - Each operation involves setting all elements from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(lst)`: This function aims to find the optimal subarray to maximize the sum. However, its logic seems flawed because it calculates the sum of subarrays incorrectly.
   - `func_2(r, l, ops)`: This function recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
   - `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`: This function updates the array and appends operations to the list.

3. **Analyzing `func_1(lst)`**:
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates their sums.
   - The sum calculation `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2` is incorrect. It doesn't account for the MEX value properly.
   - The function returns indices `r` and `l`, but these indices are not used effectively in the subsequent functions.

4. **Analyzing `func_2(r, l, ops)`**:
   - This function recursively constructs the operations needed to achieve the desired subarray configuration.
   - It calls itself twice, which suggests it might be trying to build up the operations, but the logic is not clear.

5. **Analyzing `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**:
   - This function updates the array and appends operations to the list.
   - It sets the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the value `n`, where `n` is the length of the subarray.
   - The function also checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0 and sets it again, which is unnecessary.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:
- Incorrect logic in `func_1(lst)` for finding the optimal subarray.
- Ineffective use of the indices returned by `func_1(lst)` in subsequent functions.
- Unnecessary and incorrect operations in `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
