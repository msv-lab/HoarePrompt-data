The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed. The function replaces the sublist in `lst` from index `r + 1` to `l + 1` (inclusive) with `n` copies of `n`, where `n` is the length of the sublist.
