Output State: **`r` is an integer such that `0 <= r < len(lst)`, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, `lst` is a list of non-negative integers, `ops` is a list that includes `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1], 0]` or `[r + 1, l + 1, [r + 1, l + 1]]` and now also includes `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])` appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the existing list `ops`. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and the existing elements of `ops` remain unchanged. The new element `[r + 1, l + 1]` is added to `ops`.
