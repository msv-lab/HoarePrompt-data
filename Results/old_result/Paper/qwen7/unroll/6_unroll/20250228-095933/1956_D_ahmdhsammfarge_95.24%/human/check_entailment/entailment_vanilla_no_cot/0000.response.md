Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Objective**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not directly address the problem of maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing the specified operations. Instead, they seem to be trying to find some kind of optimal subarray to modify, but the logic is flawed.

2. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find a subarray that maximizes the sum of the array by considering the sum of elements outside the subarray plus the square of the subarray length. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to use the MEX value to fill the subarray.
   - The logic inside the nested loops is also incorrect for finding the optimal subarray to modify using the MEX value.

3. **Incorrect Implementation in `func_2` and `func_3`**:
   - The functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly implement the operations required to fill the subarray with the MEX value. They appear to be recursively trying to split the array, which is not relevant to solving the problem.
   - The `func_3` function incorrectly appends operations to the list without properly handling the MEX value calculation and application.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you would need to:
- Identify the smallest missing element (MEX) in any subarray.
- Replace all elements in that subarray with the MEX value.
- Repeat this process until the sum of the array cannot be increased further.

This involves iterating through the array and using a sliding window approach to find the MEX value for each subarray and then updating the array accordingly. The operations should be recorded to ensure the solution meets the problem's requirements.

Given the complexity and the specific nature of the problem, a correct implementation would involve dynamic programming or a greedy approach to keep track of the MEX values and update the array efficiently.
