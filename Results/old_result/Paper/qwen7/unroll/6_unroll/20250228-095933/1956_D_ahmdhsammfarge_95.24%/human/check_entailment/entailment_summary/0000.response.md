Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations. Each operation involves setting a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.

2. **Analyzing the Functions**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function finds the optimal split point to maximize the sum of the array. However, the provided implementation seems to be incorrect because it uses a nested loop to calculate the sum of subarrays, which is inefficient and does not correctly implement the MEX logic.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to generate a sequence of operations but appears to be overly complex and recursive, which might not be necessary for the problem's requirements.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function is responsible for applying the operations. It correctly sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operations to the `ops` list. However, the recursive calls in `func_2` suggest that the overall logic might be flawed.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the smallest missing positive integer (MEX) for each subarray and update the subarray accordingly.
   - We should avoid unnecessary recursive calls and focus on directly calculating the MEX and updating the array.

4. **Reviewing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution starts by finding the optimal split point using `func_1`, which is incorrect.
   - The recursive calls in `func_2` and `func_3` do not seem to align with the problem's requirements.
   - The main loop at the end attempts to fill zeros with 1s, which is a different approach and does not seem to follow the problem's constraints.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting subarrays to their MEX values. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
