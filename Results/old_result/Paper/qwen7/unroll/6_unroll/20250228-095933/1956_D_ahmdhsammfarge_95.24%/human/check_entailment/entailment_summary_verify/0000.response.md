### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it against the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements by applying the MEX operation no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
   - The MEX operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The solution must output the maximum sum and a sequence of operations to achieve it.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_1`: This function seems to be trying to find a subarray that maximizes a certain sum, but it does not involve the MEX operation.
   - `func_2`: This function appears to be recursively appending operations to a list, but it does not relate to the MEX operation.
   - `func_3`: This function updates the list by replacing a sublist with a specific value and appends operations to a list. However, it does not correctly compute the MEX or apply the operation.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - `func_1` is attempting to find a subarray that maximizes a certain sum, but it does not consider the MEX operation. The logic inside the nested loops does not align with the problem's requirement.
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that appends operations to a list, but it does not involve the MEX operation.
   - `func_3` is supposed to update the list and append operations, but it does not correctly compute the MEX or apply the operation.

Given the above points, the code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions do not follow the problem description and do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not follow the problem description and do not achieve the goal of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations.
