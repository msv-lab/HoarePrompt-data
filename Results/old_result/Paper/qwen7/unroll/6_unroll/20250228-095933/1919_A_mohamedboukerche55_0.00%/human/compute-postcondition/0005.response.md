Output: **bob** 

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for `a` and `b`, only that they are non-negative integers between 1 and \(10^9\) inclusive, and their sum is even. The print statement simply outputs the string `'bob  '`, regardless of the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output will be the string `'bob  '`.
