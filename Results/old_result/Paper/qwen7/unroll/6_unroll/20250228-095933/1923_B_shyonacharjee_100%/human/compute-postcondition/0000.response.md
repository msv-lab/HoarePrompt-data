Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\) remains valid, and now the specific value of `t` is determined by the user's input. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
