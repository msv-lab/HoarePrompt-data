Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the string `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is updated to the input integer, and `s` is a string of '+' and '-' characters with a length equal to the new value of `n`.
