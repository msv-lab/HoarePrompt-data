Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
+-+-+-
```
The program calculates the number of negative signs (`neg`) and uses the formula `n - 2 * neg` to determine the minimum penalty. However, this approach does not always yield the optimal solution.

The correct minimum penalty for the input `+-+-+-` can be achieved by splitting the array into `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `4`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
