You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4; the array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; the string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'; the variable y is a list of n integers calculated based on the operations inside the loop, with the last element being the value of k after processing the string t from right to left.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), an array \(a\) of \(n\) integers, and a string \(t\) of length \(n\) containing only 'L' and 'R'. It then calculates a sequence of integers \(y\) based on the values in \(a\) and the direction indicated by \(t\). Specifically, it computes the product of selected elements from \(a\) modulo \(m\), following the directions in \(t\) from right to left, storing the results in \(y\). Finally, it prints the sequence \(y\).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes variables `l`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2`.
   - `l` is set to the count of 'L' characters in the string `t`.
   - `k` is initialized to the value of the element at position `l-1` or `l` modulo `m`, depending on whether the last character of `t` is 'L' or 'R'.
   - `q1` and `q2` are initialized based on the position of the last 'L' or 'R' in the string `t`.

3. **Output Array Initialization:**
   - An array `y` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The last element of `y` is set to `k`.

4. **Processing Commands:**
   - The loop iterates from `n-2` down to `0`.
   - If the current character in `t` is 'R', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the next element in `a` and taking modulo `m`. It also increments `q2`.
   - If the current character in `t` is 'L', it updates `k` by multiplying it with the previous element in `a` and taking modulo `m`. It also decrements `q1`.
   - The updated value of `k` is stored in the corresponding position in `y`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `y`.

### Verification:

1. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where the last character of `t` is 'L' or 'R' by setting `k` appropriately.
   - The loop correctly processes the commands in reverse order, updating `k` and adjusting indices `q1` and `q2` as needed.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program correctly applies the modulo operation after each multiplication, ensuring that the intermediate results do not overflow.

3. **Order of Operations:**
   - The program processes the commands in the correct order, starting from the end of the string `t` and moving towards the beginning.

4. **Output Array:**
   - The output array `y` is constructed correctly, storing the remainder of the product of the remaining elements in `a` at each step.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program processes the commands in the correct order, updates the value of `k` appropriately, and constructs the output array `y` as required.

Correctness: **True**
