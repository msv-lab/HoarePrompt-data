Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the squared distances between pairs of points and printing the minimum of those distances. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the side length of the square. The squared distances calculated do not necessarily correspond to the side lengths of the square; they could be diagonals or other distances depending on the order of the points.

To correctly determine the area of the square, we need to identify the side length of the square. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by finding the difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of the corners. Specifically, the side length is the maximum difference between the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates of the given points.

The current implementation does not account for this and instead compares arbitrary squared distances, which may not reflect the side length of the square.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
