Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the program seems to focus on comparing the first and last elements and counting consecutive identical elements, which does not account for the optimal way to perform the operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The program will output `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here, we can change the entire array to the most frequent element (which is unique in this case, so we choose any one) with two operations:
1. Change elements from index 1 to 4 to 1 (cost = 4).
2. Change elements from index 1 to 1 to 2 (cost = 1).

This results in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a total cost of `5`.

Another example is:
```
6
1 1 2 2 3 3
```
The program will output `5`, but the correct answer should be `3`. We can achieve this with:
1. Change elements from index 3 to 5 to 1 (cost = 3).
2. Change elements from index 1 to 1 to 2 (cost = 1).

This results in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` with a total cost of `4`.

These examples show that the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost, hence it is incorrect.
