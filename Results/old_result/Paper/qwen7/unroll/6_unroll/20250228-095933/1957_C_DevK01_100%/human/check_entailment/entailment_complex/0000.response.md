Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
3. It then iterates through the `k` moves, reducing the effective size of the board `n` by 2 if the move is mirrored (i.e., `a != b`) and by 1 if the move is not mirrored (i.e., `a == b`).
4. After processing the `k` moves, it calls the function `func_1(n)` with the reduced board size `n`.
5. The function `func_1(n)` correctly initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with the base cases `[1, 1]`.
6. It then iteratively calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `i` using the recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (7 + 10^9)\) for \(i\) ranging from 2 to `n`.
7. Finally, it returns the last element of the `dp` array, which represents the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem description and the provided code, the logic and calculations are consistent with the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
