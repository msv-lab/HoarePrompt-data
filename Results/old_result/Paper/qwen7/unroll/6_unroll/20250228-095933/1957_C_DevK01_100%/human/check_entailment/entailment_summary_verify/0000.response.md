### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after a series of moves where you and the computer place rooks alternately. The key points are:
1. No two rooks can attack each other (same row or column).
2. The computer mirrors your moves unless the move is on the diagonal.
3. The final configurations are counted modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       L = list(map(int, input().split()))
       (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
       for j in range(k):
           L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
           (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
           if a != b:
               n -= 2
           else:
               n -= 1
       print(func_1(n))
       continue
   ```
   - This loop reads the input and processes each test case.
   - For each move, it checks if the rook is placed on the diagonal (`a == b`), reducing `n` by 1, or off-diagonal (`a != b`), reducing `n` by 2.
   - It then calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of configurations.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       dp = [1, 1]
       for i in range(2, n + 1):
           dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
           dp.pop(0)
       return dp[-1]
   ```
   - This function uses dynamic programming to compute a value based on a specific recurrence relation.
   - The recurrence relation \((dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) \% (7 + 10^9)\) is used to generate the sequence.
   - The initial values are set to `[1, 1]`.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` computes a sequence using a specific recurrence relation. However, the recurrence relation and initial values do not align with the combinatorial problem described in the problem statement.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Track the remaining rows and columns after each move.
2. Use combinatorial methods to count the number of valid configurations.

The provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it incorrectly reduces `n` based on the placement of rooks and uses a dynamic programming approach that is unrelated to the problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations. The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is not relevant to the problem, and the main loop's logic for reducing `n` is flawed.

**Final: False**
