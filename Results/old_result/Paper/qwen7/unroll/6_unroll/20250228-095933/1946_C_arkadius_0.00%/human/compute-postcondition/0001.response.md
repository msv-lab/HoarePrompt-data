The only variable in the loop head is the variable `stack`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `stack`. For the loop to execute, `stack` must not be empty.

Right before the loop, `stack` is a list containing one tuple `(s, False)`. This means that `stack` is not empty, so no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (s, False)**
