### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the given program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Objective**: Determine the MEX (minimum excludant) of the array `c` after both players play optimally.
- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice starts with an empty array `c`.
  - On Alice's turn, she picks one element from `a`, appends it to `c`, and deletes it from `a`.
  - On Bob's turn, he picks one element from `a` and deletes it from `a`.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
  - The MEX of `c` is calculated at the end.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n+1` to count the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - Iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency count.
   - Checks for numbers that appear exactly once or twice and prints the first such number.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.
   - It directly computes the MEX based on the frequency of numbers without considering the sequence of moves.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

- **First Test Case**:
  - `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
  - If Alice picks `0` first, `c = [0]`, `a = [0, 1, 1]`.
  - Bob picks `0`, `c = [0]`, `a = [1, 1]`.
  - Alice picks `1`, `c = [0, 1]`, `a = [1]`.
  - Bob picks `1`, `c = [0, 1]`, `a = []`.
  - MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

- **Second Test Case**:
  - `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
  - If Alice picks `0` first, `c = [0]`, `a = [1, 2, 3]`.
  - Bob picks `1`, `c = [0]`, `a = [2, 3]`.
  - Alice picks `2`, `c = [0, 2]`, `a = [3]`.
  - Bob picks `3`, `c = [0, 2]`, `a = []`.
  - MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`.

- **Third Test Case**:
  - `arr = [1, 1]`
  - If Alice picks `1` first, `c = [1]`, `a = [1]`.
  - Bob picks `1`, `c = [1]`, `a = []`.
  - MEX of `[1]` is `0`.

The program's logic of counting frequencies and printing the first number that appears exactly once or twice does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategy of both players. Therefore, the program does not produce the correct MEX values.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value.

**Final: False**
