Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being iterated over the elements of the list `arr`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the list `arr`. Therefore, the state of `i` will change with each iteration.

3. **Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is being iterated over the elements of `arr`, the initial value of `i` should be the first element of `arr`.

4. **State of `arr`**: The list `arr` itself does not need to be adjusted; it is already defined as a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and its length is \(n\).

5. **State of `freq`**: The list `freq` is not directly involved in the loop condition or the loop body, so its state does not need to be adjusted.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is set to the first element of `arr` for the loop to start executing. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `arr`**
