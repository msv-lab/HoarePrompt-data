Output State: cou is 0, freq is a list where each index i (with \(0 \le i < n\)) contains the frequency of i in the original list arr, and all other elements in freq up to index n are still zeros. The loop will print and break when it finds the first element with a frequency of 1 or less, or when cou equals 2. If no such element is found, nothing will be printed.
