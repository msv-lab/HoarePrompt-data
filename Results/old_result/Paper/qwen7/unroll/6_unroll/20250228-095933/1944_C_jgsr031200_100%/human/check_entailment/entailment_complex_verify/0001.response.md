### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice can pick any element from `a`, append it to her array `c`, and delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score is the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - If there are at least two unique elements in `a`, Alice can always ensure that the MEX is at least 2 by picking two different elements and appending them to `c` in her first two turns.
   - If there is only one unique element in `a`, the MEX will be 0 because `c` will contain only that element.
   - If there are no repeated elements, the MEX will be determined by the smallest missing number in `c`.

3. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the game logic.
   - It attempts to use functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not relevant to the problem.
   - The `func_1` function is intended to calculate the MEX, but it does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategy.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To solve this, we need to count the frequency of each element in `a`.
   - If there are at least two unique elements, Alice can ensure the MEX is at least 2.
   - If there is only one unique element, the MEX will be 0.
   - If there are no repeated elements, the MEX will be determined by the smallest missing number in `c`.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that `func_1` is intended to find the first number with a frequency of 1 or 0. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game turns and does not account for the optimal strategy.
   - The code does not handle the case where there are at least two unique elements, ensuring the MEX is at least 2.
   - The code does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not account for the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness:** False

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
