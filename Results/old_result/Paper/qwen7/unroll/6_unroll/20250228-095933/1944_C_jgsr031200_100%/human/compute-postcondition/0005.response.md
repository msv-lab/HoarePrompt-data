Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter and starts from 0 in this case.
   - The variable `n` is the upper limit of the loop, which is `n + 1` as specified in the loop.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `cou` is 0.
   - `freq` is a list of integers where each index `i` (with \(0 \le i < n\)) contains the frequency of `i` in the original list `arr`.
   - All other elements in `freq` up to index `n` are still zeros.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, it needs to be set to 0.
   - The value of `n` should be such that the loop runs from `0` to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, `n` should be the upper limit of the loop, which is given as `n + 1`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the final state after adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is `n` (the upper limit of the loop)**.
