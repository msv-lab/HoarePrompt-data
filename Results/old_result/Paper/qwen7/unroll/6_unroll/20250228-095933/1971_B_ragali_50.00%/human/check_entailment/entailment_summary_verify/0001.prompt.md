You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input().strip(' '))
    for i in range(t):
        s = input().strip(' ')
        a = set()
        for i in s:
            a.add(i)
        if len(a) > 1:
            print('YES')
            newstr = s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2]
            isreverse = s[::-1]
            if newstr != s:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[:len(s) // 2])
            elif isreverse != s:
                print(isreverse)
            else:
                print(s[len(s) // 2:] + s[0:len(s) // 2])
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. It checks if the string has more than one unique character. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string `s` (either by swapping halves or reversing the string). If false, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs exactly `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Creating a Set of Characters:**
   - It creates a set `a` from the string `s`. This set will contain unique characters from `s`.
   - If the size of the set is greater than 1, it means there are at least two different characters in the string.

3. **Checking for Rearrangement Possibility:**
   - If the set size is greater than 1, the program checks if rearranging the string `s` can produce a different string.
     - It tries to create a new string `newstr` by splitting `s` into two halves and concatenating them in reverse order.
     - It also checks if reversing the string `s` produces a different string.
     - If either of these conditions is met, it prints "YES" followed by the rearranged string.
     - If neither condition is met, it prints "NO".

4. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - If the set size is 1, it means the string `s` consists of only one character, and thus, no rearrangement can produce a different string. Therefore, it prints "NO".

### Issues Identified

1. **Rearrangement Logic:**
   - The logic for rearrangement is flawed. The current approach does not guarantee that the new string `newstr` will be different from the original string `s`.
   - For example, if `s = 'abc'`, `newstr = 'bcab'` which is still a permutation of `s`.
   - The approach of reversing the string and checking if it's different is also problematic because reversing the same string twice will give the original string back.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, if the string has an odd length, the split operation might not work as expected.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the new string `r` is different from `s`. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        # Check if the string has more than one unique character
        if len(set(s)) > 1:
            # Create a new string by swapping the first and last characters
            newstr = s[-1] + s[1:-1] + s[0]
            print("YES")
            print(newstr)
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for rearrangement. A corrected version is provided above. Therefore, the original program is **Incorrect**.
