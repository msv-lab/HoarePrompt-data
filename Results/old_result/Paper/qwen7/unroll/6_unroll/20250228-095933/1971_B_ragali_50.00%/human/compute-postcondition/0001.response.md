State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. At the start of the loop, `i` is 0, but the loop will start its first iteration when `i` becomes 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.
