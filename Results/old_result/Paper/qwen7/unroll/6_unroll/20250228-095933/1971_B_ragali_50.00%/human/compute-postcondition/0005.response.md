Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. It checks if the string has more than one unique character. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by a modified version of the string `s` (either by swapping halves or reversing the string). If false, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs exactly `t` lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case.**
