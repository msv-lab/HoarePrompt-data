Output State: **The program returns either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the `bit`-th bit of the value is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet provided simply returns the value of `thing1`. From the initial state, we know that `thing1` is either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the `bit`-th bit of the value is 0. Therefore, the program returns either -1 or the maximum value in `new_arr` where the `bit`-th bit of the value is 0.
