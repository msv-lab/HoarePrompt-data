Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate participants based on their preferences. Introverts need individual tents, extroverts prefer to share tents with two others, and universals can adapt to any situation.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(extroverts, universals)`**: This function calculates the minimum number of tents required for extroverts and universals combined. It uses the condition that extroverts should be grouped in threes, and any remaining individuals (if the remainder is less than 3) can be accommodated by universals.
   - **Function `func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`**: This function calculates the total number of tents needed by first calling `func_1` for the extroverts and universals, and then adding the number of tents needed for introverts (each introvert needs one tent).

3. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the case where extroverts cannot form complete groups of three, ensuring that any remaining individuals (less than 3) are handled by universals.
   - `func_2` correctly adds the number of tents needed for introverts to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement align with the logic implemented in the functions.
   - The output hints for both functions indicate that they handle edge cases appropriately, such as returning `-1` when it's impossible to satisfy all preferences.

Given the analysis, the functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
