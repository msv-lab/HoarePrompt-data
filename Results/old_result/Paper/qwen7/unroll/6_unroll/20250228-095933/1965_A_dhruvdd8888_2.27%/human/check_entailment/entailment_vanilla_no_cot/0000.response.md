Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_1()` without any logic to process each test case individually.
2. **Incorrect Parsing of Input**: The program uses `input().split()` to parse the list of numbers, which is incorrect because it splits the string into individual characters instead of splitting by spaces. It should use `map(int, input().split())` to correctly convert the input strings to integers.
3. **Logic Errors**: The logic in `func_1()` is flawed. Specifically, the part where it checks the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list is incorrect and does not align with the Nim game strategy.
4. **Unnecessary Code**: The code includes some unnecessary imports and a random number generation (`rrr = randint(8888, 88888)`), which do not contribute to solving the problem.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import *
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *
from random import randint

for _ in range(int(input())):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Find the minimum value in the sorted list
    min_val = min(nums)
    
    # Count how many piles have the minimum number of stones
    count_min = nums.count(min_val)
    
    # If the count of piles with the minimum number of stones is odd, Alice wins
    if count_min % 2 != 0:
        print("Alice")
    else:
        print("Bob")

```

This corrected version properly processes each test case and implements the correct logic to determine the winner based on the Nim game strategy.
