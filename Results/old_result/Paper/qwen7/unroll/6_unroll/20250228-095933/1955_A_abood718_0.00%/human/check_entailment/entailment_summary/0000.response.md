Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic and compare it with the requirements:

1. **Case 1: \(2b < c\)**:
   - The problem states that if the price of two yogurts on promotion (\(c\)) is less than twice the regular price of one yogurt (\(2b < c\)), then the optimal strategy is to buy all yogurts individually at the regular price (\(a \times b\)).
   - The program checks this condition and prints \(a \times b\) if true. This is correct.

2. **Case 2: \(a\) is even**:
   - If \(a\) is even, the program calculates the cost of buying \(\frac{a}{2}\) pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (\(\frac{a \times c}{2}\)).
   - This is correct because buying \(\frac{a}{2}\) pairs of yogurts will cover all \(a\) yogurts, and the total cost would be \(\frac{a \times c}{2}\).

3. **Case 3: \(a\) is odd**:
   - If \(a\) is odd, the program first prints \(\frac{a}{2}\) (integer division), which represents the number of complete pairs of yogurts.
   - It then calculates the cost of these pairs (\(\frac{a}{2} \times c\)) and adds the cost of the remaining single yogurt (\(b\)).
   - This is also correct because it covers the scenario where one yogurt is left unpaired and must be bought at the regular price.

The program correctly handles all the specified conditions and outputs the minimum cost for each test case as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
