Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Assignment**: The variables `A`, `B`, and `C` are assigned correctly from the input for each test case. This part is also correct.

3. **Price Comparison**: The condition `if B * 2 < C:` checks whether it is cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotional price or at the regular price for two. This logic is correct.

4. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`. This is correct because buying `A/2` pairs of yogurts at the promotional price would cover all `A` yogurts.

5. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If `A` is odd, the program splits the purchase into `A//2` pairs at the promotional price and one yogurt at the regular price. This is correct because:
   - `X = A // 2` gives the number of pairs that can be bought at the promotional price.
   - `X * C + B` calculates the total cost for these pairs plus the remaining yogurt.

6. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case as required. The output format matches the problem statement.

Given that all parts of the program handle the logic correctly and produce the expected output based on the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
