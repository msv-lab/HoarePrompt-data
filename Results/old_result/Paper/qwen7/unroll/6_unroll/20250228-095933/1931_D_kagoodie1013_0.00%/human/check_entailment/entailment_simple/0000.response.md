Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case to find the number of beautiful pairs.
3. For each element in the array, it calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`.
4. It uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the frequency of these moduli.
5. The count of beautiful pairs is incremented based on the frequencies found in the dictionaries.
6. The logic for checking if a pair is beautiful (i.e., `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`) is correctly implemented.
7. The program iterates through the array once per test case, making it efficient given the constraints.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
