Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). For each entry in `test_cases`, the function calculates the count of occurrences of the moduli of each number in the array with respect to \( x \) and \( y \). It then appends these counts to a list `results`. Finally, the function returns the list `results` containing the counts for each entry in `test_cases`.**
