Output State: `results` is a list where each element corresponds to the count calculated for each `test_cases` entry. For each entry, the count is determined by iterating through the array `arr`, calculating the modulus of each number with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the occurrences of these moduli in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. The final count for each entry is the sum of the counts from both maps, and this count is appended to the `results` list.
