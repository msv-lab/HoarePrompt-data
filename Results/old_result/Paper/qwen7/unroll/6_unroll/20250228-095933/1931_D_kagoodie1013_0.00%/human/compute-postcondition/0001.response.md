State: **`results` is an empty list, test_cases is a non-empty list of tuples containing 4 elements each**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains four variables: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple with exactly four elements (`n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`).
3. The variable `results` is not used in the loop condition or initialization, so its state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list of tuples, each containing exactly four elements.

Thus, the final state is as described above.
