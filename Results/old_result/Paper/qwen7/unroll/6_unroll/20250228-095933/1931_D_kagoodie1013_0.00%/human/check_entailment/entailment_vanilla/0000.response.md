Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. It then uses a function `func_1` to calculate the number of beautiful pairs.
4. In `func_1`, it initializes two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, to keep track of the counts of numbers modulo `x` and `y` respectively.
5. For each element in the array, it calculates the modulus with respect to `x` and `y`, and updates the count of beautiful pairs using these dictionaries.
6. The logic for calculating the number of beautiful pairs seems correct:
   - For each element, it checks how many previous elements have the required modulus values to form a beautiful pair.
   - It updates the dictionaries with the current element's modulus values.
7. The program outputs the results for each test case correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
