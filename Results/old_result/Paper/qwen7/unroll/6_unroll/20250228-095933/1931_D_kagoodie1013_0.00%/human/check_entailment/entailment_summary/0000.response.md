Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and then processes it. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Test Case Processing**: The program iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary values (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`) and storing them in a list of tuples `test_cases`.
3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: For each test case, the program uses two dictionaries (`mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`) to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. This helps in efficiently counting pairs that satisfy both conditions.
4. **Modulo Calculations**: The program correctly handles the modulo operations, including the adjustment for negative numbers (`-num % x`).
5. **Result Collection**: The count of beautiful pairs for each test case is accumulated and stored in the `results` list, which is returned at the end.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct output based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
