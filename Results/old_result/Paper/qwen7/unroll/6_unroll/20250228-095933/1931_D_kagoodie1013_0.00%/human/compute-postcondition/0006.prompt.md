You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). The constraints are \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \), \( 1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9 \), and \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        
        mod_x_map = {}
        
        mod_y_map = {}
        
        for num in arr:
            mod_x = -num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            count += mod_x_map.get(mod_x, 0) + mod_y_map.get(mod_y, 0)
            mod_x_key = num % x
            mod_y_key = num % y
            mod_x_map[mod_x_key] = mod_x_map.get(mod_x_key, 0) + 1
            mod_y_map[mod_y_key] = mod_y_map.get(mod_y_key, 0) + 1
        
        results.append(count)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list where each element corresponds to the count calculated for each `test_cases` entry. For each entry, the count is determined by iterating through the array `arr`, calculating the modulus of each number with respect to `x` and `y`, and counting the occurrences of these moduli in `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`. The final count for each entry is the sum of the counts from both maps, and this count is appended to the `results` list.
    return results
    #The program returns a list 'results' where each element corresponds to the count calculated for each 'test_cases' entry. For each entry, the count is determined by iterating through the array 'arr', calculating the modulus of each number with respect to 'x' and 'y', and counting the occurrences of these moduli in 'mod_x_map' and 'mod_y_map'. The final count for each entry is the sum of the counts from both maps.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). For each entry in test_cases, the function calculates the count of occurrences of the moduli of each number in the array with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), and returns a list of these counts.

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'results' where each element corresponds to the count calculated for each 'test_cases' entry. For each entry, the count is determined by iterating through the array 'arr', calculating the modulus of each number with respect to 'x' and 'y', and counting the occurrences of these moduli in 'mod_x_map' and 'mod_y_map'. The final count for each entry is the sum of the counts from both maps.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
