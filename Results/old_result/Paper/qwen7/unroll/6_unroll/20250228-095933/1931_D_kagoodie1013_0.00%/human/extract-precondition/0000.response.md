Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) followed by a list of \( n \) integers representing the array \( a \). The constraints are \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \), \( 2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \), \( 1 \leq x, y \leq 10^9 \), and \( 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 \). The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).**
