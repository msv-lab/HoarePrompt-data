Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left sorted part of the list followed by single elements, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. If there are repeated elements in the left sorted part, the first occurrence of the repeated element will be printed once, and subsequent occurrences will be printed as pairs until `k` elements are printed or there are no more elements to print. The same process is applied to the right sorted part, but only single elements are printed from it. Elements are taken from the sorted parts in order until `k` elements are printed per line or all elements are processed.
