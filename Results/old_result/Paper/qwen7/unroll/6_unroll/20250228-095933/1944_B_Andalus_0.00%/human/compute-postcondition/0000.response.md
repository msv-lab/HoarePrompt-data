Output State: **`T` is an input integer between 1 and 5000.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is later renamed to `T`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), the value of `T` will be an integer within this range. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
