Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Subset Handling**: The code attempts to create subsets `ldb` and `rdb` by checking for consecutive duplicates in `lft` and `rgt`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the XOR values of the subsets will match. The logic for selecting elements from `ldb` and `rdb` is flawed because it doesn't ensure the XOR condition is met.

2. **Missing XOR Matching Logic**: The code does not have any mechanism to ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` equals the XOR of the selected elements in `r`. Simply selecting elements based on duplicates does not guarantee the required XOR equality.

3. **Incomplete Handling of `sng` Elements**: The `sng` list contains unique elements that appear only once in their respective halves. The code handles these elements in a way that doesn't necessarily ensure the XOR condition is met.

4. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting is somewhat arbitrary and does not guarantee that the XOR condition is satisfied. The code prints elements directly without ensuring the XOR condition holds true.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should use the properties of XOR and the fact that each number from 1 to n appears exactly twice. Hereâ€™s a more correct approach:

1. **Calculate XOR for Each Half**: Compute the XOR of all elements in the left half (`lft`) and the right half (`rgt`).
2. **Find Matching XOR Pairs**: Find pairs of elements in `lft` and `rgt` whose XOR results in the desired value.
3. **Construct Subsets `l` and `r`**: Ensure that the XOR of the chosen elements in `l` and `r` match.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        lft = lst[:n]
        rgt = lst[n:]

        # Calculate XOR of all elements in lft and rgt
        xor_lft = 0
        xor_rgt = 0
        for num in lft:
            xor_lft ^= num
        for num in rgt:
            xor_rgt ^= num

        # Find pairs in lft and rgt whose XOR matches
        l = []
        r = []
        seen = set()

        for num in lft:
            if xor_lft ^ num in rgt and xor_lft ^ num not in seen:
                l.append(num)
                r.append(xor_lft ^ num)
                seen.add(num)
                seen.add(xor_lft ^ num)

        # Output the results
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This approach ensures that the XOR condition is met by finding pairs of elements whose XOR results in the required value.
