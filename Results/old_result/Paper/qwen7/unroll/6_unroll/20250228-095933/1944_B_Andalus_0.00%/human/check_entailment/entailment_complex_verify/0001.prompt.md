You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: Output State: The output will consist of pairs of elements from the left sorted part of the list followed by single elements, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. If there are repeated elements in the left sorted part, the first occurrence of the repeated element will be printed once, and subsequent occurrences will be printed as pairs until `k` elements are printed or there are no more elements to print. The same process is applied to the right sorted part, but only single elements are printed from it. Elements are taken from the sorted parts in order until `k` elements are printed per line or all elements are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. For each test case, it outputs pairs of elements from the left sorted part of the list followed by single elements from both the left and right sorted parts, ensuring no more than `k` elements are printed in each line. Repeated elements in the left sorted part are handled such that the first occurrence is printed once, and subsequent occurrences are printed as pairs until `k` elements are printed or there are no more elements to print. The same process is applied to the right sorted part, but only single elements are printed from it. Elements are taken from the sorted parts in order until `k` elements are printed per line or all elements are processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Splitting the List:**
   - The list `lst` is split into `lft` (first `n` elements) and `rgt` (last `n` elements).

3. **Finding Duplicate Elements:**
   - The program attempts to find duplicate elements in `lft` and `rgt`. However, this approach is flawed because it only checks for duplicates within each half separately, which doesn't guarantee that the XOR condition will be met.
   - The program incorrectly handles the XOR condition and does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements from `lft` matches the XOR of the selected elements from `rgt`.

4. **Generating Output:**
   - The program prints elements from `ldb` (list of duplicate elements from `lft`) and `sng` (list of single occurrences from `lft`), but it does not ensure that the XOR of these elements matches the XOR of corresponding elements from `rdb` (list of duplicate elements from `rgt`).

### Detailed Issues

- **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates:**
  - The program tries to use duplicate elements to form the required subsets, but it doesn't consider the overall XOR balance between `lft` and `rgt`.

- **Incomplete Logic for XOR Matching:**
  - The program does not have a mechanism to ensure that the XOR of the chosen elements from `lft` matches the XOR of the chosen elements from `rgt`.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

#### Input:
```
4
2 1
1 2 2 1
6 1
6 4 2 1 2 3 1 6 3 5 5 4
4 1
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

#### Expected Output:
```
2 1
2 1
6 4
1 3
1 2
1 2
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```

#### Actual Output (from the provided program):
```
2 1
2 1
6 4
1 3
1 2
1 2
5 1 3 3
6 4 2 4
```

While the output appears to match the expected output in this specific example, the program logic is flawed and does not guarantee correctness for all possible inputs. The program does not ensure that the XOR of the chosen elements from `lft` matches the XOR of the chosen elements from `rgt`.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
