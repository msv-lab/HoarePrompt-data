Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, it only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" in chunks of 3 characters at a time, but it does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings. For example, in the string "mappie", the program would incorrectly identify only one occurrence of "pie" instead of two.

To fix this, the program should continue checking the string until no more "map" or "pie" substrings are found, even if they overlap. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a):
            if a[i:i+3] == 'map' or a[i:i+3] == 'pie':
                ans += 1
                i += 3  # Skip the next 3 characters since we've removed them
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This version ensures that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are correctly identified and counted, even if they overlap.
