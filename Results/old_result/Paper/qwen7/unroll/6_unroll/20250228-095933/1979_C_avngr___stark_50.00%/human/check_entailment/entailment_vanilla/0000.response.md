Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. 

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers when divided by each individual multiplier.
   - It then computes the required bet amounts (`c`) for each outcome by dividing `m` by each `k[i]`.
   - The `func_1` function is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the computed bet amounts.
   - After finding the GCD, the bet amounts are divided by this GCD to ensure they are simplified.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the simplified bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the bet amounts and checking the condition is sound.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bet amounts are simplified, which is necessary to minimize the total bet while satisfying the condition.
   - The code handles the edge case where the sum of the bet amounts is not less than the required value by printing `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
