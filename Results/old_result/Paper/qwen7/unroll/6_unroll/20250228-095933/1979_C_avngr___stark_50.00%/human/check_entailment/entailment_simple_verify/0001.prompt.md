You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

    6 3 2
    
    5
    
    9 4 6 8 3

Output

    27 41 12 
    1 1 
    -1
    1989 1547 4641 819 1547 1071 
    -1
    8 18 12 9 24
    
Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; k_i is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `hcf` is the highest common factor (greatest common divisor) of all elements in `numbers`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in `numbers` starting from the second element. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) between the current value of `hcf` and the current element of `numbers`, updating `hcf` with this new GCD value. After completing all iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of all elements in the `numbers` list.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers` after iterating through each element and updating the HCF accordingly.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. 

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers when divided by each individual multiplier.
   - It then computes the required bet amounts (`c`) for each outcome by dividing `m` by each `k[i]`.
   - The `func_1` function is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the computed bet amounts.
   - After finding the GCD, the bet amounts are divided by this GCD to ensure they are simplified.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the LCM divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the simplified bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the bet amounts and checking the condition is sound.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bet amounts are simplified, which is necessary to minimize the total bet while satisfying the condition.
   - The code handles the edge case where the sum of the bet amounts is not less than the required value by printing `-1`.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
