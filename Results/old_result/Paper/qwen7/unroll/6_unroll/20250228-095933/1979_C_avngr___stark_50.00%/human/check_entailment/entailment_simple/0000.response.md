Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome. This involves calculating the least common distribution of bets that meets the criteria.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k_i`).
   - It then calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which represents the minimum amount of coins that would need to be returned for any winning outcome.
   - Next, it computes the required bets (`c`) using the formula `m / k[i]` for each outcome, ensuring that the total bet is less than the return amount for any winning outcome.
   - It uses a helper function `func_1` to find the highest common factor (HCF) of the calculated bets.
   - The bets are then divided by the HCF to ensure they are integers and to minimize the values while maintaining the condition.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the bets is less than or equal to the HCF times the smallest multiplier. If true, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly calculates the HCF of a list of numbers using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
   - It iterates through the list and updates the HCF by taking the GCD of the current HCF and the next number in the list.
   - This ensures that the final HCF is the greatest common divisor of all numbers in the list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the sum of bets might be equal to or greater than the required return amount, ensuring the correct output of `-1` in such scenarios.

Given the above analysis, the program logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
