Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50; `k_i` is a list of positive integers such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n; `hcf` is the highest common factor (greatest common divisor) of all elements in `numbers`.

Explanation: The loop iterates through each element in `numbers` starting from the second element. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) between the current value of `hcf` and the current element of `numbers`, updating `hcf` with this new GCD value. After completing all iterations, `hcf` will hold the GCD of all elements in the `numbers` list.
