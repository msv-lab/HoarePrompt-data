Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. This involves finding a set of bets \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\) such that the sum of these bets is less than the product of the bet on any outcome and its corresponding multiplier.

2. **Key Steps in the Given Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers \(m = k_1 \times k_2 \times \ldots \times k_n\).
   - It computes the required bets as \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\).
   - It finds the highest common factor (HCF) of these computed bets using the `func_1` function.
   - It adjusts the bets by dividing each \(c_i\) by the HCF.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the adjusted bets is less than or equal to the product divided by the HCF. If so, it prints the adjusted bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The calculation of \(m = k_1 \times k_2 \times \ldots \times k_n\) is correct.
   - The computation of \(c_i = \frac{m}{k_i}\) is also correct.
   - The use of the `gcd` function to find the HCF is appropriate.
   - The adjustment of bets by dividing by the HCF ensures that the bets remain integers.
   - The final check to ensure the sum of bets is less than the product divided by the HCF is correct and necessary.

Given that the logic and calculations in the code align with the problem requirements and the provided examples, the code appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
