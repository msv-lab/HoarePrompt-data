### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes (`n`) and the multipliers (`k`).
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers (`m`), which should represent the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers when divided by each individual multiplier. However, the product of multipliers (`m`) directly is not the LCM but rather the product of the multipliers.
   - It then computes the required bet amounts (`c`) for each outcome by dividing `m` by each `k[i]`. This step is correct because it ensures that the bet amounts are proportional to the multipliers.
   - The `func_1` function is used to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the computed bet amounts.
   - After finding the GCD, the bet amounts are divided by this GCD to ensure they are simplified.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the simplified bet amounts is less than the product of the multipliers divided by the GCD. If true, it prints the simplified bet amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating the bet amounts and checking the condition is sound.
   - The use of GCD ensures that the bet amounts are simplified, which is necessary to minimize the total bet while satisfying the condition.
   - The code handles the edge case where the sum of the bet amounts is not less than the required value by printing `-1`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic related to the calculation of the LCM. The product of the multipliers (`m`) is not the LCM but rather the product of the multipliers. To correctly calculate the LCM, we need to use the formula for the LCM of two numbers, and extend it to more than two numbers. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

To fix this, we need to use the `math.lcm` function available in Python 3.9+ to compute the LCM of the multipliers. Alternatively, we can implement the LCM calculation manually using the GCD function.

### Corrected Approach:
1. Calculate the LCM of the multipliers using `math.lcm` or manually.
2. Ensure the bet amounts are calculated correctly.
3. Check the condition with the correct LCM.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the product of the multipliers (`m`) is the LCM. This assumption leads to incorrect calculations and potentially incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
