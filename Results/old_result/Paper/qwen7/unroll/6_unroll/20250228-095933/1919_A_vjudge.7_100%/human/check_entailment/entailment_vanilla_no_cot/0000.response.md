Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. However, this logic does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules. According to the game rules, the player who cannot make a valid move loses. Let's analyze the correct approach:

1. **Key Insight**: The player who faces a situation where their wallet has 1 coin left when it's their turn will lose because they cannot remove another coin (as per the game rules).

2. **Winning Condition**: If one player's wallet has 1 coin and the other player's wallet has more than 1 coin, the player with 1 coin will lose. This is because the player with more than 1 coin can always force the player with 1 coin to lose by swapping and then reducing their own wallet to 1 coin.

3. **Optimal Play**: Both players will try to avoid leaving themselves with exactly 1 coin in their wallet. If both players play optimally, the player who starts with an odd number of coins minus 1 (i.e., an even number of coins) will eventually be forced into a losing position.

Given these insights, the correct solution should check if either `a` or `b` is 1 and the other is greater than 1. If so, the player with 1 coin will lose. Otherwise, the player who starts with an odd number of coins minus 1 will win.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1 and b > 1:
            print('Bob')
        elif b == 1 and a > 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')

func()
```

This code correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the game logic is followed accurately.
