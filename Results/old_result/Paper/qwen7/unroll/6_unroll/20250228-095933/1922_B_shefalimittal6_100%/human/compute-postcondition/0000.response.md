Output State: **`input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This changes how input is read from standard input, but it does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the constraints and properties of these variables remain unchanged.
