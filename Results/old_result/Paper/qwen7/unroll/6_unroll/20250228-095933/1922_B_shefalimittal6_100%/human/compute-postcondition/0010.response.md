Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a list a containing n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` indirectly accepts a series of test cases through its internal processing, where each test case consists of an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns a result based on the specified conditions.
