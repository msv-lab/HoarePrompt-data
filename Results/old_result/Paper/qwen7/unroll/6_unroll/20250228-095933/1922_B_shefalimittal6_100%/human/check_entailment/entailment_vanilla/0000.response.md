Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list `data`.
   - It then processes this data to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of sticks `n` and the array `a` representing the exponents.
   - It initializes an array `v` to count occurrences of each exponent value.

3. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - It iterates through the array `a` and counts how many times each exponent appears in `v`.

4. **Calculating Number of Ways to Form a Triangle:**
   - To form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - Given that the lengths are powers of 2, we need to check combinations of three sticks where the sum of the smaller two lengths is greater than the largest length.

5. **Combination Counting:**
   - The program uses combinatorial counting to find the number of valid triplets:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same length, it counts pairs and adds to the result.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same length, it counts triplets and adds to the result.
   - It also keeps track of the cumulative count of sticks seen so far (`cnt`).

6. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

### Detailed Check:

- **Handling Duplicates:**
  - The program correctly handles cases where multiple sticks have the same length by counting pairs and triplets appropriately.

- **Triangle Inequality:**
  - Since the lengths are powers of 2, the program implicitly checks the triangle inequality because the sum of any two powers of 2 will always be greater than the third power of 2 if they are distinct.

- **Cumulative Count:**
  - The cumulative count `cnt` helps in correctly calculating the number of valid pairs and triplets without double-counting.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases like having no valid triangles (e.g., all sticks have different lengths and cannot form a triangle).

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. It handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
