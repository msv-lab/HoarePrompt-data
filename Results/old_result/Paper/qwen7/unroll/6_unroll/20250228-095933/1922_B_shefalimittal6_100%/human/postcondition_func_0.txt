The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of test cases, an integer n indicating the size of the list a, and a list a of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the frequency of each integer in the list a and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints each result from the list on a new line.
