Output State: **`idx` is 0, `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and the list `a` contains n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of all n values over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5; data is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `idx` to 0. This does not affect the values of `input`, `t`, `n`, `a`, or `data`. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the new value of `idx`.
