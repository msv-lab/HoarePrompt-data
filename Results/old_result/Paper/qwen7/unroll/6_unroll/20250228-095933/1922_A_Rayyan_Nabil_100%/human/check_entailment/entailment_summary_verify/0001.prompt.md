You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple sets of inputs, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of strings), and three strings \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) (each of length \( n \)). For each set of inputs, it calls another function `func_1` to process the strings and stores the result. After processing all sets, it prints the results of each set. The function does not return any value but modifies an internal list `results` which contains the processed outputs for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine if there exists a template `t` such that both strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not.
   - A template `t` can have lowercase or uppercase letters. If a letter in `t` is lowercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must match. If a letter in `t` is uppercase, the corresponding letter in `a`, `b`, or `c` must not match.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if for every character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`.
   - If this condition holds for all positions, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - However, this function only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not sufficient to determine if a template exists where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` for each.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It only checks if `a` and `b` do not match `c` at the same position, which is not enough to determine if a valid template exists.
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if there exists a combination of lowercase and uppercase characters in `t` such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. This involves more complex logic than what `func_1` provides.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if a valid template exists.

**Correctness: **False**
