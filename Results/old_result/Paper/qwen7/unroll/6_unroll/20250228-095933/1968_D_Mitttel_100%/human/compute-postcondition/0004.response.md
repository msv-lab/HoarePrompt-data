Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
2. **Analyze each part of the condition**:
   - `not vis[s]`: This means that the value at index `s` in the list `vis` should be `False` (or `0`, since the list contains only `0`s initially).
   - `k > 0`: This means that the variable `k` should be greater than `0`.

3. **Check the current state**:
   - `mx` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `cur` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `0`. Initially, all elements in `vis` are `0`, so `vis[s]` is `0` (which is equivalent to `False`).

4. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - Since `vis[s]` is `0` (which is `False`), the condition `not vis[s]` is already satisfied.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than `0`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than `0`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
