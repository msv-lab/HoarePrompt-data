Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>' representing the direction of the arrow in the corresponding cell of the grid; after executing all iterations of the loop, for each test case, if the second last character of the second string is '<', the output will be 'No', otherwise the output will be 'Yes'.
