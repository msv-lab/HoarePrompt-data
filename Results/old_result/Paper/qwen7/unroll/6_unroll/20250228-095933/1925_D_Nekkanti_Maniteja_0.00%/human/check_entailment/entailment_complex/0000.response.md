Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is done using the expression `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`, which is the correct way to compute the modular inverse in Python.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` accumulates the sum of the friendship values `f_i` for all given pairs of friends. This is done correctly with the line `a += f`.

4. **Calculation of Expected Value**: The main logic for calculating the expected value involves the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`. This formula seems to be derived from the problem's requirements, but let's verify it step-by-step:
   - `c * i * c * m`: This term likely represents the contribution of each pair being chosen `i` times over `k` excursions.
   - `c * a`: This term represents the initial contribution of the sum of friendship values.

5. **Output**: The final value of `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the annotations and the code, the program appears to follow the correct logic for solving the problem. However, there is a potential issue with the formula used to calculate the expected value. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` might not accurately represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values as described in the problem. The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen and the expected increase in friendship value.

To ensure correctness, the formula should be re-evaluated based on the problem's requirements. However, based on the provided code and annotations, the implementation follows the general structure required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` might not correctly represent the expected value of the sum of friendship values. A more accurate approach would involve calculating the expected value considering the probability of each pair being chosen and the expected increase in friendship value.
