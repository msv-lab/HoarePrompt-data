Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the expected increase in friendship values over the k excursions.

The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but it does not properly incorporate the probabilities and expected values of the friendship increases. Instead, it incorrectly adds a constant value `c * a` for each excursion, which does not reflect the actual expected value calculation.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the probability of selecting each pair and the expected increase in friendship values. The correct approach involves calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these values over all k excursions. Here is a brief outline of the correct approach:

1. Calculate the probability of selecting each pair.
2. For each pair, calculate the expected increase in friendship value over k excursions.
3. Sum these expected values to get the final result.

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
