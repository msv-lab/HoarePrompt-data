Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). This is necessary because the number of ways to choose a pair from `n` children is \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), and we need the modular inverse to handle large numbers correctly.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and incremented by the friendship value `f` for each friend pair. This correctly sums up the initial friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values using the formula \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \). Here, `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`, and the term \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) accounts for the increase in friendship values due to the probability of choosing a friend pair. The term \( c \cdot a \) accounts for the initial sum of friendship values.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is necessary to ensure the result fits within standard integer limits.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is correct.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
