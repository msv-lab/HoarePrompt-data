### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the term `c * i * c * m` in the expected value calculation is incorrect. Let's break down why this is the case and how the program should be corrected.

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is correct. This ensures that when we multiply by `c`, we effectively divide by \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The sum `a` of friendship values is correctly calculated.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The problem requires finding the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The term `c * i * c * m` does not align with the problem statement. Instead, the correct approach involves understanding the probability of choosing a friend pair and the expected increase in friendship value.

   - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a friend pair is \(\frac{\text{number of friend pairs}}{\text{total number of pairs}} = \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a friend pair in each excursion is 1 (since the friendship value increases by 1 if chosen).
   - Therefore, the expected contribution of each friend pair to the sum in one excursion is \(\frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times 1 = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
   - Over k excursions, the expected contribution of each friend pair is \(k \times \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
   - Summing this over all friend pairs gives the total expected value: \(k \times \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

Given the above analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the solution because it uses an incorrect formula for the expected value. The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = k \times \frac{2m}{n(n-1)} \times \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \]

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_value = (k * (2 * m * a) * c) % M
        print(expected_value)
```

### Final Evaluation:

**False**

The original program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in the expected value calculation.
