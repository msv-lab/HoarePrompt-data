Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs `(n * (n - 1) / 2) mod M`. This is used in the calculation of the expected value.
3. **Friendship Value Sum**: The program correctly sums up the friendship values (`a`) from the input for each test case.
4. **Expected Value Calculation**: The program uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` to calculate the expected value. However, this formula seems to be incorrect based on the problem statement. The correct approach should consider the probability of picking a friend pair in each excursion and how the friendship value changes over time.
5. **Modular Arithmetic**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

Given the problem description, the expected value should be calculated considering the probability of picking a friend pair and how the friendship value evolves over the excursions. The provided code does not correctly implement this logic.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not accurately reflect the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the expected value is incorrect.
