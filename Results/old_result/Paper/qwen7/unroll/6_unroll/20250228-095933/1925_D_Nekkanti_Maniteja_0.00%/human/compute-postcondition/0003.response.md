Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, and k, along with arrays a, b, and f. The function validates the constraints for t, n, m, and k, and the values within arrays a, b, and f. It returns different outputs based on the validation results for each test case.**

- For each test case, it checks if t is within the range 1 to 5 * 10^4.
- It verifies that for each test case, n is between 2 and 10^5, m is between 0 and the minimum of 10^5 and n(n-1)/2, and k is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- It ensures that all elements in arrays a and b are unique, within the range 1 to n, and that all elements in array f are within the range 1 to 10^9.
- It also confirms that the sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
