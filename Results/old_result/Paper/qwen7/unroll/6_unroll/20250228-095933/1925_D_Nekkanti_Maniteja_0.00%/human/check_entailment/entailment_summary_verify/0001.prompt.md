You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        s = 0
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        print(s % M)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, m, and k, and arrays a, b, and f. For each test case, it calculates a value `s` using specific formulas involving modular arithmetic and the sum of elements in the array f. Finally, it prints the result of `s` modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used as the modulus.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - A variable `a` is initialized to 0.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads `u`, `v`, and `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Calculating Expected Sum:**
   - The program initializes `s` to 0.
   - For each of the `k` excursions, it updates `s` as follows:
     - `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`
   - Finally, it prints `s % M`.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The calculation of `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is correct. This ensures that when we multiply by `c`, we effectively divide by \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The sum `a` of friendship values is correctly calculated.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` seems to be an attempt to calculate the expected sum of friendship values.
   - However, the term `c * i * c * m` does not seem to align with the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen for the excursions. The term `c * i * c * m` does not directly contribute to this calculation.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` in the expected value calculation is incorrect. The correct approach would involve calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion and summing these values.

### Correctness:

**False**
