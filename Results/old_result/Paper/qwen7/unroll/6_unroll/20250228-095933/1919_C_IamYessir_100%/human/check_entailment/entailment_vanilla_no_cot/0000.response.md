Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Arrays**: The logic used to decide whether to append an element to `a` or `b` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for appending elements to `a` or `b` are not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect splits.

2. **Redundant Conditions**: There are redundant conditions in the logic that do not correctly handle the splitting of the array. For example, the condition `if x == y: a.append(lit[i])` is unnecessary and can be removed.

3. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty calculation part is correct but could be optimized. However, the main issue lies in the splitting logic.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize two lists to store the subsequences
        s = []
        t = []
        
        # Iterate through the array and split it optimally
        for num in lit:
            if not s or num > s[-1]:
                s.append(num)
            else:
                t.append(num)
        
        # Calculate the penalties for both subsequences
        def calculate_penalty(subseq):
            return sum(1 for i in range(len(subseq) - 1) if subseq[i] < subseq[i + 1])
        
        penalty_s = calculate_penalty(s)
        penalty_t = calculate_penalty(t)
        
        # Output the total penalty
        print(penalty_s + penalty_t)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is split into two subsequences `s` and `t` such that `s` is non-decreasing and `t` is non-increasing, which minimizes the total penalty.
