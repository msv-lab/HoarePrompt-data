Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input from `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations for the loop.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` is the value that will be used as the argument to `range()`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already described as being within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it meets the requirement for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
