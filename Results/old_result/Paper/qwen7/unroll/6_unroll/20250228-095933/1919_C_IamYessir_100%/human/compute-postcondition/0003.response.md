Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where it receives an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer t, followed by an integer n and a list of n integers. It processes each test case according to the specified constraints and returns relevant information for each case.
