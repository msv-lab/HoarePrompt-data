Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process a list of integers (representing a binary string) and calculate the sum of all segments of consecutive 1's plus the number of such segments. This is not aligned with the problem statement which requires sorting the binary string using cyclic shifts.
   - The logic inside `func_1` counts the number of segments of consecutive 1's and adds the length of these segments plus one for each segment. This does not represent the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case. However, `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
   - Since `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts, `func_2` also cannot produce the correct output.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Both functions do not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
