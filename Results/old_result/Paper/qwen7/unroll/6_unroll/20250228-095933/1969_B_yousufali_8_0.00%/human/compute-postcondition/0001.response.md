State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.
2. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment since it is used as a counter within the loop.
3. The key variable here is `t`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.
4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`. If `t` is 0 or negative, the range will be empty or invalid, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.
