### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order with the minimum total cost. The cost of an operation is the length of the substring chosen for a cyclic shift.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, which is not consistent with the problem statement where the input is a binary string.
   - It splits the input string into a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input should be treated as a string.
   - The logic inside the loop is trying to count the number of 1s before a 0 appears and adding the cost (length of that segment plus one) to the answer. This logic does not correctly simulate the cyclic shift operation required to sort the string.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1` is incorrectly implemented, it will not solve the problem correctly.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to identify segments of 1s and 0s and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
   - The correct approach involves identifying the longest segment of 0s and calculating the cost to move all 1s to the front.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The summary states that `func_2` processes `t` test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, as explained earlier.

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - We need to iterate through the string and find the longest segment of 0s.
   - For each segment of 0s, the cost to move all 1s to the front is the length of the segment plus the position of the start of the segment.
   - Summing these costs for all segments gives the minimum total cost.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
