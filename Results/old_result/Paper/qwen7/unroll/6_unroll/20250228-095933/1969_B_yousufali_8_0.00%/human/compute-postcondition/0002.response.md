Output State: **t test cases have been processed.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, with each iteration calling `func_1()`. Since no variables are modified within the loop and `func_1()` is called but its behavior (what it does) is not specified, we can only conclude that `t` test cases have been processed.
