### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly.
2. **Character Counting**: For each test case, the program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' using two counters `ac` and `bc`. However, there is a critical flaw in the way these counters are used. The current implementation resets the counters `ac` and `bc` for each test case, which means it only counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' within each individual string, not across all strings. As a result, the comparison `if ac > bc:` will only reflect the count for the current string, not the cumulative count across all strings.
3. **Comparison and Output**: The program compares the counts of 'A' and 'B' for each string independently and prints the result. Since the counters are reset after each string, the comparison is not meaningful for the entire set of strings.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle the edge case where the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal. In such cases, the program will print either 'A' or 'B', which is not specified in the problem description.
5. **Distinct Strings**: The problem statement mentions that all strings in a test are distinct, but this does not affect the correctness of the program since it processes each string independently. However, the program still fails to accumulate the counts across all strings.

Given the above points, the program is not logically sound and does not correctly implement the required functionality. It fails to count the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' across all strings and does not handle the case where the counts are equal.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
