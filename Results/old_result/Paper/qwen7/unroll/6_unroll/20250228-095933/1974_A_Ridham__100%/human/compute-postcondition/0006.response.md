Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it returns a specific output based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the lack of direct parameter definition in the function signature, it's clear that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases internally, each containing `t`, `x`, and `y`. The function processes these values and returns a result for each test case, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified in the given information.
