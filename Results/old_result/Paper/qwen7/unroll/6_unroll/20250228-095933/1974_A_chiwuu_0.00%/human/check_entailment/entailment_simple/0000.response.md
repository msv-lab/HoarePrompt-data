Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variable Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `a` and `b` (which correspond to `x` and `y` in the problem statement) and calculates `t` which is initially set to `b * 2`. This represents the minimum number of screens needed if only 2x2 icons were placed.

3. **Adjustment for 2x2 Icons**: 
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, then `t` is adjusted to `t // 5`. This means if the total number of 2x2 icons fits perfectly into 5 columns, it reduces the count of screens.
   - Otherwise, `t` is adjusted to `t // 5 + 1`, meaning if there is any remainder, an additional screen is needed.

4. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. Each 2x2 icon takes up 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 * 3).

5. **Placement of 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space (`t1`) is greater than or equal to `a` (number of 1x1 icons), then no additional screens are needed beyond what was calculated for 2x2 icons.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many more screens are needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by checking if the remaining space is divisible by 15, and if not, adding an extra screen.

6. **Final Calculation and Output**:
   - The final value of `t` is printed, which should be the minimum number of screens needed.

Given the logic, the code seems to follow the problem statement accurately. However, let's verify the logic with some test cases:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 26`
  - Since `t1 > 1`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
  - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `t1 = 4 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 52`
  - Since `t1 > 7`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
  - `t = 4 * 2 = 8`
  - `t1 = 8 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 104`
  - Since `t1 > 12`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
  - `t = 3 * 2 = 6`
  - `t1 = 6 * 15 - 3 * 4 = 84`
  - Since `t1 > 0`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
  - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
  - No 2x2 icons, so `t = 1` (since at least one screen is needed).
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
  - `t = 1 * 2 = 2`
  - `t1 = 2 * 15 - 1 * 4 = 26`
  - Since `t1 > 8`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
  - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
  - No icons, so `t = 0`.
  - Output: `0`

- **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
  - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
  - No 2x2 icons, so `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
  - `t = 0 * 2 = 0`
  - No 2x2 icons, so `t = 1`.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
  - `t = 2 * 2 = 4`
  - `t1 = 4 * 15 - 2 * 4 = 52`
  - Since `t1 > 8`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
  - `t = 9 * 2 = 18`
  - `t1 = 18 * 15 - 9 * 4 = 234`
  - Since `t1 > 0`, no additional screens are needed.
  - Output: `1`

Based on the analysis and test cases, the logic appears to be correct. Therefore, the program is correct.
