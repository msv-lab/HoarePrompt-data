Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then processes each test case. It reads `x` and `y` for each test case, where `x` is the number of 1x1 icons and `y` is the number of 2x2 icons.

2. **Calculation of Screen Requirement**:
   - The program calculates `t` as `b * 2`, which seems to be an initial estimate of the number of screens needed considering the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means that the initial estimate perfectly fits into the grid without any remainder, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `t` is incremented by 1 to account for the remainder.
   - Then, it calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This seems to be an attempt to account for the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons, so `t` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, it calculates how many additional screens (`t2`) are needed to accommodate the remaining 1x1 icons and adds them to `t`.

3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `t` for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the logic in the program does not seem to align with the requirements. Specifically, the calculation of `t` and the subsequent adjustments do not accurately reflect the minimum number of screens required to place all icons.

For instance, the example provided shows that for `x = 12` and `y = 4`, the correct answer should be `2` screens, but the program might not correctly handle this scenario due to the way `t1` and `t2` are calculated.

Therefore, the program does not appear to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **False**
