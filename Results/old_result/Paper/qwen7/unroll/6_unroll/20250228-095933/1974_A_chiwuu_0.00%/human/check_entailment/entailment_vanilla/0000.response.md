Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens for 2x2 Icons:**
   - It calculates `t = b * 2`. This represents the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means that the number of cells is exactly divisible by 5, so it sets `t` to `t // 5`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `t` to `t // 5 + 1`, which accounts for any remainder when dividing by 5.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - It calculates `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This represents the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1 >= a`, it means there are enough remaining cells to place all 1x1 icons, so it sets `t` to `t`.

4. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates `t2 = a - t1`, which is the number of additional cells needed for 1x1 icons.
   - If `t2 % 15 == 0`, it means the number of additional cells is exactly divisible by 15, so it adds `t2 // 15` to `t`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` to `t`, accounting for any remainder when dividing by 15.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `t`, which is the minimum number of screens needed.

### Testing and Validation

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 2x2 icon (4 cells) and one 1x1 icon. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `7 2`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons (8 cells) and seven 1x1 icons. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `12 4`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Four 2x2 icons (8 cells) and twelve 1x1 icons. Two screens are needed.
   - Program Output: `2`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `0 3`
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: Three 2x2 icons (6 cells). Two screens are needed.
   - Program Output: `2`

5. **Test Case 5:**
   - Input: `1 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 1x1 icon. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

6. **Test Case 6:**
   - Input: `8 1`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One 2x2 icon (4 cells) and eight 1x1 icons. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

7. **Test Case 7:**
   - Input: `0 0`
   - Expected Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No icons. Zero screens are needed.
   - Program Output: `0`

8. **Test Case 8:**
   - Input: `2 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Two 1x1 icons. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

9. **Test Case 9:**
   - Input: `15 0`
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Fifteen 1x1 icons. One screen is sufficient.
   - Program Output: `1`

10. **Test Case 10:**
    - Input: `8 2`
    - Expected Output: `2`
    - Explanation: Two 2x2 icons (8 cells) and eight 1x1 icons. Two screens are needed.
    - Program Output: `2`

11. **Test Case 11:**
    - Input: `0 9`
    - Expected Output: `3`
    - Explanation: Nine 1x1 icons. Three screens are needed.
    - Program Output: `5`

### Conclusion

The program does not produce the expected output for Test Case 11. Specifically, it outputs `5` instead of `3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
