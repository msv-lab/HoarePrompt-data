### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`
This function uses binary search to find the smallest index in the list `a` where the element is greater than or equal to `x`.

```python
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx
```

- **Correctness**: This function is correct. It returns the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an element does not exist, it returns `-1`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

```python
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized with `[0]` to store cumulative sums.
   - `last` is initialized with `[-1]` to keep track of the last index where the value was different from the current one.
   - `ans` is initialized with `[-1] * n` to store the result for each slime.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - For each element in `a`, we append the cumulative sum to `left`.

3. **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
   - For each slime at index `i`, if it is smaller than the previous one (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`), it will be eaten immediately, so `ans[i] = 1`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, which represents the sum of sizes of all slimes before the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus one (to account for the current slime itself).
   - We use `func_1` to find the index of the smallest prefix sum greater than `x`.
   - `inx2` is set to `last[i - 1]` to handle cases where the current slime could have been eaten by a previous slime of the same size.
   - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, we update `inx` to `inx2`.
   - If `inx` is still negative, we skip this slime.
   - Otherwise, we compute the time taken as `i + 1 - inx` and store it in `ans[i]`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The cumulative sum `left` is correctly computed, ensuring that `left[i]` gives the total size of slimes up to index `i-1`.

2. **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
   - The logic for finding the nearest smaller slime using `func_1` is correct.
   - The handling of cases where the current slime is smaller than the previous one (`ans[i] = 1`) is correct.
   - The handling of cases where the current slime could have been eaten by a previous slime of the same size (`inx2 = last[i - 1]`) is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where a slime is smaller than the previous one.
   - The function correctly handles cases where no slime can eat another slime.

### Verification

After reviewing the code and the annotated version, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution for the problem. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem.
