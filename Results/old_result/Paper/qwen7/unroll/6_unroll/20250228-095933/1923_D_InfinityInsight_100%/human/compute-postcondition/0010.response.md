Output State: `left` is a list containing the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` from the first element to the last; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is determined by the conditions inside the loop based on the values of `a`, `left`, and `last`. Specifically, for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, if `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx` where `inx` is calculated based on the values of `left`, `x`, and `last`. If certain conditions are not met (like `inx < 0`), `ans[i]` remains -1.
