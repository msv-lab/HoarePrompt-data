Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from 1 to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` should be set to 1 because the loop starts from 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the state of the variables**:
   - `left` is a list containing 0.
   - `last` is a list containing -1.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.
   - These lists do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

5. **Formulate the final state**:
   - `i` must be 1 for the loop to start.
   - `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**.
