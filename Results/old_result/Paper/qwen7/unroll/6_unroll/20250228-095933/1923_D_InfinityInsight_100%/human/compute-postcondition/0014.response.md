Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where each element in `ans` is calculated based on specific conditions encountered during the iteration, potentially updating to `i + 1 - last[a[i]]` if certain conditions are met during each iteration. The function constructs two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to keep track of cumulative sums and the last occurrence indices, respectively, and uses these to determine the values in the output list `ans`.**
