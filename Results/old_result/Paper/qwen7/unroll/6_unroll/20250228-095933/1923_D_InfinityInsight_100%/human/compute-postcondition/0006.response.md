Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop**: 
   - `left` is a list containing 0.
   - `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `a`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` is iterating over `a`, the list `a` itself is not directly modified within the loop (it's just being iterated over).
   - The variable `i` will take on the values from the list `a` during each iteration.
   - The lists `left`, `last`, and `ans` are not directly modified by the loop itself, but their initial states must be considered.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted is the list `a` because the loop will iterate over it. However, since the problem specifies that no adjustments are needed for the lists `left`, `last`, and `ans`, we can conclude that their initial states are sufficient.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts remains as given:

State: **`left` is a list containing 0, `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in the array `a`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing -1**.
