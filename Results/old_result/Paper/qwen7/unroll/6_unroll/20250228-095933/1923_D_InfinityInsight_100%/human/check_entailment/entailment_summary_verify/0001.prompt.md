You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the sizes of slimes and an integer `n` indicating the length of the list. It returns a list `ans` of the same length `n`, where each element in `ans` is calculated based on specific conditions encountered during the iteration, potentially updating to `i + 1 - last[a[i]]` if certain conditions are met during each iteration. The function constructs two auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to keep track of cumulative sums and the last occurrence indices, respectively, and uses these to determine the values in the output list `ans`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the solution for the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function is used to find the position of the smallest element greater than or equal to `x` in the list `a`. It uses binary search via `bisect_left`.

```python
def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx
```

- This function is correct. It returns the index of the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an element does not exist, it returns `-1`.

#### Function `func_2`
This function aims to calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime.

```python
def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
    for i in a:
        left.append(left[-1] + i)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue
        x = left[i] - a[i] - 1
        inx = func_1(left, x)
        inx2 = last[i - 1]
        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2
        if inx < 0:
            continue
        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx
    return ans
```

1. **Initialization:**
   - `left` is initialized with `[0]` to store cumulative sums.
   - `last` is initialized with `[-1]` to keep track of the last index where the value was different from the current one.
   - `ans` is initialized with `[-1] * n` to store the result for each slime.

2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - For each element in `a`, we append the cumulative sum to `left`.

3. **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
   - For each slime at index `i`, if it is smaller than the previous one (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`), it will be eaten immediately, so `ans[i] = 1`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate `x = left[i] - a[i] - 1`, which represents the sum of sizes of all slimes before the current slime minus the size of the current slime minus one (to account for the current slime itself).
   - We use `func_1` to find the index of the smallest prefix sum greater than `x`.
   - `inx2` is set to `last[i - 1]` to handle cases where the current slime could have been eaten by a previous slime of the same size.
   - If `inx2` is less than `inx`, we update `inx` to `inx2`.
   - If `inx` is still negative, we skip this slime.
   - Otherwise, we compute the time taken as `i + 1 - inx` and store it in `ans[i]`.

### Verification

The logic seems correct in terms of identifying the nearest smaller slime and calculating the time taken for each slime to be eaten. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

1. **Edge Cases:** The function handles cases where a slime is smaller than the previous one correctly by setting `ans[i] = 1`.
2. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:** The cumulative sum calculation is correct.
3. **Binary Search Usage:** The usage of `func_1` to find the appropriate index is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and should work as intended for the problem.

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten by another slime, given the constraints and examples provided.
