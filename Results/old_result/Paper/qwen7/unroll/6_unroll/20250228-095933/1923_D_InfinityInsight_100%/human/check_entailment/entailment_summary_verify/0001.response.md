### Reasoning

The original assessment is generally accurate, but let's break down the key points to ensure completeness and correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly uses binary search to find the smallest element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such an element does not exist, it returns `-1`.
   - This function is implemented correctly and is used appropriately in `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `left` is used to store cumulative sums of the sizes of slimes.
     - `last` keeps track of the last index where the value was different from the current one.
     - `ans` stores the result for each slime.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
     - The cumulative sum is correctly computed and stored in `left`.
   - **Finding the Nearest Smaller Slime:**
     - The logic for determining when a slime is smaller than the previous one and setting `ans[i] = 1` is correct.
     - The calculation of `x` as `left[i] - a[i] - 1` is correct.
     - The use of `func_1` to find the appropriate index is correct.
     - The handling of `inx2` to handle cases where the current slime could have been eaten by a previous slime of the same size is also correct.
     - The final calculation of `i + 1 - inx` is correct.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles cases where a slime is smaller than the previous one by setting `ans[i] = 1`.
   - The cumulative sum calculation is correct and ensures that the sum of sizes before the current slime is accurately maintained.
   - The binary search usage in `func_1` is correct and efficiently finds the appropriate index.

2. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and correctly implements the problem's requirements.
   - The program iterates through the list of slimes and correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**
