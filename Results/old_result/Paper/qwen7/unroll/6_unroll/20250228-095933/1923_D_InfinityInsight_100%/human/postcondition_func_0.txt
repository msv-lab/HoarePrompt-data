The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a non-negative integer `x`. It searches for the smallest index of a slime in the list `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`. If such a slime exists, it returns either the index of the first slime that meets the condition (Case_3) or `inx + 1` where `inx` is the index of the first slime that meets the condition (Case_2). If no slime in the list meets the condition, it returns -1 (Case_1).
