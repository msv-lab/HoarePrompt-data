Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, k is an integer such that 2 <= k <= 30, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 100, and a is an integer such that 1 <= a <= 10^9. After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `a` is compared with the computed value of `s` for each iteration, resulting in either 'Yes' or 'No' printed for each comparison.

The initial values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the loop processes multiple inputs, each time updating `s` based on the current values of `k` and `x`. The final state of `a` remains the same as the initial state, but the output will be a series of 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison between `a` and `s` for each iteration.
