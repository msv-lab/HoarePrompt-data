Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to determine if Sasha can achieve having at least `n` coins (`a` in the program) given the constraints of the problem.
2. The program processes each test case individually, calculating a threshold value `s` using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations, starting from `s = 1`.
3. The logic behind this calculation is to simulate Sasha's betting strategy, where after each loss, he increases his bet by a factor related to `k`, ensuring he doesn't lose more than `x` times consecutively.
4. The program then checks if Sasha's initial amount `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If so, it prints 'Yes', indicating Sasha can achieve his goal; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
5. The program correctly handles the constraints for `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` as specified in the problem statement.
6. The provided examples in the execution summary match the expected behavior of the program, confirming its correctness.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
