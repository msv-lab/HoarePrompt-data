### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they can be rotated to match each other.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution provided uses a function `func_1` to check if Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` returns `'yes'` if \(b \% 2 == 0\) (i.e., if \(b\) is even) and `'no'` otherwise.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` checks if \(b\) is even.
   - If \(b\) is even, the function returns `'yes'`, indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is odd, the function returns `'no'`, indicating that Bob cannot obtain another rectangle.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: \(b\) is even:**
     - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles.
     - These two smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle, such as \(2a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{b}{2} \times 2a\), which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - **Case 2: \(b\) is odd:**
     - If \(b\) is odd, the only way to cut the \(a \times b\) rectangle is into two \(a \times 1\) rectangles.
     - These two \(a \times 1\) rectangles can only be rearranged to form the original \(a \times b\) rectangle or its rotations, which do not count as a different rectangle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the function `func_1` correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle based on whether \(b\) is even or odd.

However, there is a flaw in the logic. The function only checks if \(b\) is even, but it does not consider all possible ways to cut the rectangle. Specifically, it fails to account for the case where \(a\) is even and \(b\) is odd, or vice versa. In these cases, Bob can still obtain a different rectangle by cutting along the \(a\) dimension.

For example:
- If \(a = 4\) and \(b = 3\), the function would return `'no'` because \(b\) is odd. However, Bob can cut the \(4 \times 3\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and then rearrange them to form a \(6 \times 2\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios.
