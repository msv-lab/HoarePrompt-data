Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
- According to the provided solution, the function `func_1` checks if \(b\) is an even number. If \(b\) is even, it returns 'yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
- However, the logic provided in `func_1` does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically, it only checks if \(b\) is even, but does not consider all possible ways to cut and rearrange the rectangles.
- For instance, if \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the function correctly identifies that another rectangle can be formed because \(b\) is even. But for other cases like \(a = 3\) and \(b = 2\), the function incorrectly returns 'no' because \(b\) is even, when in fact another rectangle can be formed by cutting the \(3 \times 2\) rectangle into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and rearranging them to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.
- Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
