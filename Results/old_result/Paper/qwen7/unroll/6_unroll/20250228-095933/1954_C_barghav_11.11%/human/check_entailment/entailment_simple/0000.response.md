### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the product of two numbers `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits. The provided solution attempts to achieve this by swapping the digits in the first half of the numbers and then swapping them back in the second half.

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function takes two lists `a` and `b`, which represent the characters of the input strings `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates over the first half of the lists, swapping the minimum and maximum values between corresponding positions in `a` and `b`.
   - For the second half, it swaps the minimum and maximum values but in reverse order compared to the first half. This ensures that the first half becomes the largest possible while the second half remains the smallest possible.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The first half of the digits is sorted in descending order relative to each other, maximizing the value of the first half.
   - The second half of the digits is sorted in ascending order relative to each other, minimizing the value of the second half.
   - This approach aims to maximize the product by ensuring the higher digits contribute more significantly to the overall value of the numbers.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the modified strings `a` and `b` after the operations.
   - The output format matches the requirement of printing the modified `x` and `y` on separate lines.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided solution handles the edge case where the first half and second half are swapped correctly.
   - The additional constraints (digits from 1 to 9) are respected.

### Conclusion:

The provided code correctly implements the logic to maximize the product of `x` and `y` by swapping their corresponding digits. The logic and the implementation are sound, and the output format matches the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
