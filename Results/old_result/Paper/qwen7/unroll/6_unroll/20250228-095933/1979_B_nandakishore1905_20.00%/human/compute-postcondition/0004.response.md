Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \( k \) between \( n \) and \( m \). Depending on the value of \( k \), it prints one of four possible values: \( k \), \( 1 \), \( 2 \), or \( k - q \), where \( q \) is the highest power of 2 less than \( k \). If \( k \) is a power of 2, it prints \( k \). If \( n \) is 0 and \( m \) is odd, it prints 1. If \( n \) is 0 and \( m \) is even, it prints 2. Otherwise, it calculates \( q \) and prints \( k - q \). The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the results directly.**
