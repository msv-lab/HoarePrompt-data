Output State: **The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. The final output will be 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. If any condition leads to a 'NO' or 'MAYBE' being printed, that will be the final output for that specific test case. If all conditions lead to a 'YES', then 'YES' will be the final output.**

This description indicates that the final state of `t` and other variables will reflect the last output produced by the loop, which could be 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE', depending on the inputs and conditions evaluated during each iteration.
