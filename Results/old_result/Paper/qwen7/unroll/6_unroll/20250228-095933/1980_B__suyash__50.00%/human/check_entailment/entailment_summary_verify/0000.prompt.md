You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

        b = list(map(int, a.split()))

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `a`, two indices `f` and `k`, and a sequence of strings `o`. It checks if a specific element in `o` (identified by index `f`) can be moved up to position `k` in the sorted order of unique elements in `o`. Based on the result of this check, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'. The final output for each test case is determined by the conditions evaluated within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes after sorting. Here is an example that demonstrates this issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - "MAYBE" because after sorting, the array becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (3) could end up in the second or third position, so it might or might not be removed depending on the exact order of the other cubes.

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program incorrectly prints "NO".

The program fails to consider all possible positions of the favorite cube after sorting and the impact of removing the first `k` cubes. It only checks if the favorite cube is in a position greater than `k-1` after sorting, which is not sufficient to determine the correct outcome.
