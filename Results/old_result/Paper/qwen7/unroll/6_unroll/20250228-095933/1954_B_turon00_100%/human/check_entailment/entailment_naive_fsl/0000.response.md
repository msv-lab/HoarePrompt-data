Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the removal of elements to break the beauty condition. Instead, it counts consecutive occurrences of the same element and outputs the minimum count as the result. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of removing elements in between to break the beauty condition.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program would output `1`, but the correct answer is `1` (removing the second `1` breaks the beauty condition). However, the program would also incorrectly output `1` for the input:
```
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```
This input should also output `-1` because removing any single element cannot break the beauty condition. The program fails to handle this case correctly, as it does not consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements in between.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
