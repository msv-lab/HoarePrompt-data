### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - An array is beautiful if there exists an index \(i\) (2 ≤ \(i\) ≤ \(n-1\)) such that \(a[i-1] = a[i+1]\), and \(a[i]\) can be replaced with \(a[i-1]\).
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that no such index \(i\) exists after removing some elements.

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0. `ans` is initialized to \(n\) (the maximum possible answer).
   - It iterates through the array and checks if the current element matches `tmp`. If it does, it increments `cnt`. If it doesn't, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If \(n\) is 1 or `ans` equals \(n\), it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful). Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to find the minimum number of removals seems flawed. The code only counts consecutive elements that are the same but does not ensure that the array remains beautiful after any removal.
   - The approach should focus on identifying segments where the array can still be made beautiful even after removals. Specifically, it should identify the longest segment where the array can be made beautiful and subtract this from the total length.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example given:
     - Test case 1: `[2, 2, 2]` → `ans = 0` (already non-beautiful).
     - Test case 2: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` → `ans = 1` (remove one '1').
     - Test case 3: `[1]` → `ans = -1` (already non-beautiful).
     - Test case 4: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` → `ans = 3` (remove the first three elements).

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides a step-by-step breakdown of the program's state, which helps in understanding the flow of the program.
   - However, the logic in the code does not accurately reflect the requirement to make the array non-beautiful. The variable `cnt` is used to count consecutive elements, but it does not account for the possibility of making the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful. The code only counts consecutive elements and does not ensure that the array remains beautiful after any removals.
