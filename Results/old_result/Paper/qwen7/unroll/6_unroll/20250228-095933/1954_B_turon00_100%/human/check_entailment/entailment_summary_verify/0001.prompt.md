You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        if n == 1 or ans == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It determines the minimum length of contiguous segments within the list \( a \) where all elements are identical. If no such segment exists, it outputs -1 for each test case. The function ultimately prints \( t \) integers, one for each test case, indicating the minimum segment length or -1 if no valid segment is found.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be made of identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - An array is beautiful if there exists an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]`, and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
   - To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that no such index `i` exists after removing some elements.

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0. `ans` is initialized to `n` (the maximum possible answer).
   - It iterates through the array and checks if the current element matches `tmp`. If it does, it increments `cnt`. If it doesn't, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If `n` is 1 or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1` (indicating it's impossible to make the array non-beautiful). Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic to find the minimum number of removals seems flawed. The code only counts consecutive elements that are the same but does not ensure that the array remains beautiful after any removal.
   - The approach should focus on identifying segments where the array can still be made beautiful even after removals. Specifically, it should identify the longest segment where the array can be made beautiful and subtract this from the total length.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example given:
     - Test case 1: `[2, 2, 2]` → `ans = 0` (already non-beautiful).
     - Test case 2: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]` → `ans = 1` (remove one '1').
     - Test case 3: `[1]` → `ans = -1` (already non-beautiful).
     - Test case 4: `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]` → `ans = 3` (remove the first three elements).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to make the array non-beautiful.
