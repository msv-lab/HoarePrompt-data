Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read an input for `t`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` has the specific value entered by the user. All other preconditions and conditions remain unchanged.
