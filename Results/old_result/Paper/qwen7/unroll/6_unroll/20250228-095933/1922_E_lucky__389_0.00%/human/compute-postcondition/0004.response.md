The only variable in the loop head is `x`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. For the loop to execute the first time, `x` must not be equal to 0.

Right before the loop, `x` is an input integer - 1. This means `x` is initially set to some integer value minus 1. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `x` must not be 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `x` is not equal to 0.

State: **`mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer - 1 and `x` must not be 0**, `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
