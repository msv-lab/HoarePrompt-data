Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5; `nums` is a set containing elements from the input split into strings, and '0' is added to the set `nums`.**

In this step, the code adds the string `'0'` to the set `nums`. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged, and the set `nums` now includes all its original elements plus the string `'0'`.
