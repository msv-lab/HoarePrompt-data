Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem description.

The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given program attempts to solve this using a different approach that does not correctly handle the conditions.

For instance, consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- According to the problem description, the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\) should satisfy the condition because:
  - For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
  - For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 1\).
  - For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).

However, the program outputs `3`, which is correct for this specific case. But let's consider another test case to confirm the issue:

- Consider \(n = 4\) and \(m = 4\):
  - Valid pairs should include \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 1)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 1)\), \((4, 2)\), \((4, 4)\).
  - The program outputs `14`, but the correct output should be `12`.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the required logic, and thus it is incorrect.
