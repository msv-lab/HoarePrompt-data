### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several issues with the provided program, particularly focusing on the incorrect calculation and logic for determining valid pairs. Let's break down the issues and verify the corrected solution.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs:**
   - The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` and the subsequent check do not correctly calculate the number of valid pairs.
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` needs to be checked properly.

2. **Complexity:**
   - The program has a time complexity of \(O(b)\) for each test case, where \(b\) can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\). This is inefficient for large values of `b`.

3. **Logic Error:**
   - The logic for checking the conditions is flawed. Specifically, the calculation of `x` and the additional check do not correctly reflect the problem requirements.

#### Corrected Solution:

The corrected solution provided in the original assessment uses a more straightforward approach:
- It iterates over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges.
- It checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` directly.

This approach ensures that the condition is correctly checked and avoids the complex and inefficient calculations present in the original program.

#### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:** The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case.
- **Loop Over Test Cases:** For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
- **Nested Loops:** It iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and `b` from 1 to `m`.
- **Condition Check:** It checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
- **Count Valid Pairs:** If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.
- **Output Result:** Finally, it prints the count for each test case.

Given the corrected solution and the verification through the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
