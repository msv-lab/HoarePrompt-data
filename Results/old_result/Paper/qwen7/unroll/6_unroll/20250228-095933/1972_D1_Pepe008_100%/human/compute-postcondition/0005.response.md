Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the given formula and prints the result, which is the calculated value minus 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, then for each test case, it reads \(a\) and \(b\), and computes the sum based on the specified formula. If the conditions for \(a\) and \(b\) are met, it performs the computation; otherwise, it handles the error appropriately. The final output consists of the results for each test case.**
