Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since `T` was initially a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the same condition holds true after the code execution. The other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
