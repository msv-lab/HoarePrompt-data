Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It then iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 to \(b\) and performs a calculation involving \(a\) and \(i\).
   - The key part of the calculation seems to be the condition where \(x = (a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\). This expression does not directly relate to the problem's requirements.
   - The program also checks if \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \% i^2 == 0\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \% i^2 == 0\), but these conditions do not align with the problem's constraints.
   - Finally, it prints the computed value minus 2.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The program does not perform this check correctly.
   - Instead, the program uses an incorrect formula involving \(i\) and \(a\), which does not reflect the required conditions.
   - The program's logic does not match the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
