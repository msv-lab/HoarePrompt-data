Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two positive integers n and m. For each test case, the function checks if the conditions 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of n and m does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6 are met. If the conditions are satisfied, the function performs some unspecified operation (since the operation itself is not detailed). If any condition is not met, the function handles the error accordingly.**
