Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50; `sorted_lst` is a list of integers which is a sorted version of `lst`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the list `lst` and assigns the sorted list to `sorted_lst`. The initial conditions about the range and length of `lst` remain unchanged, but now `sorted_lst` contains the elements of `lst` in ascending order.
