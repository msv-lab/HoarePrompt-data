You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is the same as comparing `lst` with its sorted version `sorted_lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst`, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. It checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and returns `True` if it is, otherwise it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - The program checks if the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting the digits and reinserting them is flawed. The program attempts to split the digits but does not handle the case where the element is less than 10. This can lead to incorrect results because the operation is only supposed to be applied to elements that are at least 10.
   - The current implementation of splitting and reinserting digits might not always produce the correct result, especially when the original array has elements that are less than 10.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` simply checks if the array is sorted. However, this function is called after the array has been modified, which may not reflect the intended state of the array after applying the operations.

3. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already sorted or where the operations cannot make the array sorted. For example, if the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` is processed, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
