Reasoning:
The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed before determining its correctness:

1. **Main Logic Flaw**: The main logic of the program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list, but it does not actually perform the operation iteratively until the list is sorted or determines it cannot be sorted.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is correct. However, the main loop in the program does not use this function effectively. Instead, it performs a single iteration of the described operation and then checks if the list is sorted, which is not sufficient to ensure the list can be sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Incorrect Operation Implementation**: The program's attempt to split and reinsert digits is flawed. It only performs one operation per element, which is insufficient to handle all possible cases where splitting and reinserting digits multiple times might be necessary to sort the list.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality to determine if the list can be sorted using the described operations.

Correctness: **False**
