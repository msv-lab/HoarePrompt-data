Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Processing Each Element:**
   - The program checks if the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and if the previous element is greater than 10.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation of splitting the previous element into its digits and inserting them back into the array.

3. **Checking Sorted Order:**
   - After processing all elements, the program calls a function `func_1` to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting Digits:**
   - The logic for splitting the digits and reinserting them is flawed. The program attempts to split the digits but does not handle the case where the element is less than 10. This can lead to incorrect results because the operation is only supposed to be applied to elements that are at least 10.
   - The current implementation of splitting and reinserting digits might not always produce the correct result, especially when the original array has elements that are less than 10.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` simply checks if the array is sorted. However, this function is called after the array has been modified, which may not reflect the intended state of the array after applying the operations.

3. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already sorted or where the operations cannot make the array sorted. For example, if the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]` is processed, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`, which is still not sorted.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
