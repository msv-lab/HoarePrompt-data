State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `n`, which is used to determine the number of iterations of the loop.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure it is greater than 0.
