Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the minimum number of operations required to sort the binary string in non-descending order. However, there are several issues with the logic used to calculate the answer.

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Operations**: The program counts the number of operations needed to move all '0's to the front of the string. It does this by iterating through the string and maintaining a count of '1's (`cnt[1]`) and '0's (`cnt[0]`). When a '0' is encountered, it checks if there are any '1's before it and adds to the answer accordingly. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts and their costs.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted, which is not accounted for in the current logic. The program simply increments a counter without considering the actual cost of each shift.

3. **Handling of Cyclic Shifts**: The program does not properly handle the cyclic nature of the shifts. It assumes a linear approach rather than considering the circular arrangement of the string.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
