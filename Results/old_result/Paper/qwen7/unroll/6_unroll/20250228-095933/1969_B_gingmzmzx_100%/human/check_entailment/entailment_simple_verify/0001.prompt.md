You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and s_i ∈ {0, 1}.

            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and for each input list `s`, `ans` is calculated based on the given logic and printed after the loop completes all iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. Then, for each test case, it reads a binary string `s`. However, the program converts the string into a list of integers, which is unnecessary and incorrect for this problem.
2. **Zero Counting**: The program counts the number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in `zeroes`.
3. **Count Array Initialization**: It initializes a count array `cnt` with two elements to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
4. **Cost Calculation**: The program iterates through the string `s`, updating the count array and calculating the cost. This part of the logic seems to be trying to calculate the minimum cost, but the logic is flawed.
   - For each 0 encountered, it increments the cost by 1 if there has been at least one 1 before it.
   - For each 1 encountered, it increments the cost by the number of zeroes minus the count of 0s seen so far.
5. **Output**: The calculated cost is printed for each test case.

Given the problem description, the goal is to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The current implementation does not correctly calculate the minimum cost. Instead, it appears to be calculating a different metric that does not align with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts.
