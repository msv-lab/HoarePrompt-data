Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. The logic in the program does not account for the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts on substrings.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be:

1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]` (i.e., "101") and perform a cyclic shift: `101011 -> 011011`.
2. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` (i.e., "11011") and perform a cyclic shift: `011011 -> 011101`.
3. Choose the substring `[5, 6]` (i.e., "011101") and perform a cyclic shift: `011101 -> 011110`.

The total cost would be `3 + 3 + 2 = 8`, but the program outputs `5`.

The program incorrectly counts the number of inversions without considering the actual cost of performing cyclic shifts. It does not simulate the process of performing cyclic shifts and calculating the cost accordingly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
