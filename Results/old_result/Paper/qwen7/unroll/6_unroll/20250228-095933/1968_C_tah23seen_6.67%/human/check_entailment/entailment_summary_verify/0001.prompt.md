You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`), it is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling and Loop Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of size `n-1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes the array `arr` and the length `n` as arguments.
   - It initializes an array `ans` of size `n` with zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring it is greater than `x_2`.
   - A loop runs from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), setting `ans[i+1]` such that `x_{i+2} = ans[i+2] % ans[i+1]`.
     - `ans[i+1]` is initially set to `arr[i] + ans[i]`.
     - If this value is less than `arr[i+1]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` by `ans[i]` until it is at least `arr[i+1]`.
   - Finally, `ans[n-1]` is set to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.

3. **Modulo Condition Check:**
   - The key condition is `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`.
   - The program ensures that `ans[i+1]` is always greater than or equal to `arr[i+1]` after adjustments.
   - This guarantees that the modulo operation will yield the required `x_{i+1}`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the resulting array `ans` for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Initialization:** `ans[0] = arr[0] + 1` ensures that the initial value is greater than `x_2`.
- **Loop Logic:** The loop ensures that `ans[i+1]` is adjusted to satisfy the modulo condition.
- **Final Adjustment:** `ans[n-1] = ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]` ensures the last element fits the condition.

Given the logic, the program correctly generates an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example.

**Correctness: True**
