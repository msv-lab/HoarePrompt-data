Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers, ans is a list of n integers where ans[0] equals arr[0] + 1, and for every i from 1 to n-1, ans[i] equals the sum of arr[i-1] and all previous ans values until it exceeds arr[i], ans[-1] is ans[-2] + arr[-1].**

The code updates the last element of the `ans` list by adding the last element of the `arr` list to the second last element of the `ans` list. All other elements of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged according to the initial conditions.
