You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: arr is a list of n-1 integers, ans is a list of n integers where ans[0] equals arr[0] + 1, and for every i from 1 to n-1, ans[i] equals the sum of arr[i-1] and all previous ans values until it exceeds arr[i].
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for every `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, and `n`, which is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for every `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for every `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
