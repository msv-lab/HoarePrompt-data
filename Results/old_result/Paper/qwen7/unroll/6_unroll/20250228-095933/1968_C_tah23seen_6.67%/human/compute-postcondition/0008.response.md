Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers (where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive) and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n-1`), it is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and the last element of `arr`.**
