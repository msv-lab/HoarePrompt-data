Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for every `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until it exceeds `arr[i]`, and `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**

This means the program returns a list `ans` with the first element being `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element, starting from index 1 up to `n-2`, the value is calculated as the sum of `arr[i-1]` and all previous `ans` values until the sum exceeds `arr[i]`. The last element `ans[-1]` is simply the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
