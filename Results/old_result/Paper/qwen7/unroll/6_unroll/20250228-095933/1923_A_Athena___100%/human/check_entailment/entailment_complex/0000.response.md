Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left until they form a single block without any free cells between them, and the solution should output the minimum number of operations required.
2. The provided code removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a` which represents the positions of the chips and free cells.
3. After removing the leading and trailing zeros, the code counts the number of remaining zeros in the list `a`. This count represents the minimum number of operations needed because each zero indicates a position where a chip needs to be moved to the left to form a continuous block of chips.
4. The logic in the code correctly identifies the number of operations needed by counting the number of zeros after adjusting the list to remove leading and trailing zeros.

Given these points, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
