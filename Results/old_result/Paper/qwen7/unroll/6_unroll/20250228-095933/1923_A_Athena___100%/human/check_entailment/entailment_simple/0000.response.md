Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cells.
3. It removes leading zeros from the list `a` by popping elements from the start until a non-zero element is found.
4. It removes trailing zeros by popping elements from the end until a non-zero element is found.
5. It then counts the number of zeros in the remaining list `a`, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them.
6. The logic for counting the minimum operations is correct because:
   - Leading zeros are removed, ensuring no unnecessary operations are counted for chips that are already in place.
   - Trailing zeros are removed, ensuring that the last chip does not need to be moved further than necessary.
   - Counting the zeros in the middle of the list gives the exact number of operations needed to move all chips to the leftmost possible position.

Given this analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
