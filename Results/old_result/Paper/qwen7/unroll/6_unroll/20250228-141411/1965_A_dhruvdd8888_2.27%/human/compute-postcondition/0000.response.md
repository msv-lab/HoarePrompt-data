Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer**.

The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4. The variable `N` is now assigned the value of the integer input provided by the user.
