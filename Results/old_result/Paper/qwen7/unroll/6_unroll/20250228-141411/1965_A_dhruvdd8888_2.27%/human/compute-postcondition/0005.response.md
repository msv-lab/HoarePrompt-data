Output State: **The program prints 'Alice'**

Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `N` is an input integer, and `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order with a length of 1. The code snippet does not affect `t`, `N`, or `nums`. Instead, it directly returns a print statement. Therefore, the program will print 'Alice'.
