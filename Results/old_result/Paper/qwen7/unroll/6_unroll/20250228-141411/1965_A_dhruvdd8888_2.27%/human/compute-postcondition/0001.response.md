Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a set containing elements from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `nums = set(input().split())` takes an input (which is specified as `N`), splits it into individual strings based on spaces, and then converts these strings into a set named `nums`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `N` is preserved as it was before the code execution.
