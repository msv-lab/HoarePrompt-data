Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` set to `int(input())`. Since the input is an integer, we need to ensure that the input value is valid for the loop to execute.

3. **Determine the Valid Range for `i`**: The loop will run as long as `i` is less than the upper limit of the `range` function. In this case, the upper limit is `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be at least 0 (since `range(start, stop)` generates numbers from `start` up to but not including `stop`). However, since the input is taken from user input, we cannot directly control the exact value of `i`, but we can ensure that the input is within a reasonable range.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**: The variables `t` and `n` are not used in the loop head, so their initial values do not need to be adjusted. The variable `alphabet` is also not used in the loop head, so its value does not need to be adjusted either.

5. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that the input value is valid. Given the constraints, the input should be an integer between 0 and some positive number (since `t` and `n` are constrained, the input should be within a reasonable range).

Given the constraints on `t` and `n`, the input value should be at least 1 (since `t` is between 1 and 100) and the loop will run as long as `i` is less than the input value. Therefore, the input value should be at least 1.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', and the input value must be at least 1**.
