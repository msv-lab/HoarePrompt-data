Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, m, and k, along with a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values of n, m, and k, and the sorted list of integers. The cost is determined by partitioning the list into segments and applying specific mathematical operations. After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated cost for each case.**
