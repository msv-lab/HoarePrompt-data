You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, m, and k, along with a list of n integers. For each test case, it calculates a cost based on the values of n, m, and k, and the sorted list of integers. The cost is determined by partitioning the list into segments and applying specific mathematical operations. After processing all test cases, it prints the calculated cost for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days, with constraints on the number of tickets that can be purchased each day and the price increase mechanism.

2. **Key Points in the Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M` for each day.
   - It sorts the list of prices `M` to process the cheapest prices first.
   - It calculates how many days (`q`) are needed to buy `k` tickets, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`).
   - It then processes the first `q` days to calculate the cost of buying tickets at those prices.
   - If the number of tickets bought in the first `q-1` days plus the last day's tickets equals `k`, it calculates the cost directly.
   - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets by adjusting the cost calculation.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The logic of sorting the prices and processing the first `q` days is correct.
   - The cost calculation for the first `q` days is also correct.
   - The handling of the remaining tickets is correctly adjusted by considering the price increase due to the tickets bought on the previous days.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the number of tickets bought in the first `q-1` days plus the last day's tickets equals `k`.
   - It correctly adjusts the cost calculation for the remaining tickets.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The solution correctly implements the logic to minimize the cost while adhering to the constraints.
   - The code handles all the given examples and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
