Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^{15}, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The code provided is just a header comment and does not affect the variables.**

The given code is a header comment for a Python script and does not contain any executable statements that would alter the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
