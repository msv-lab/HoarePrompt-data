Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers `x` and `y` within specified ranges, and returns different outputs based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case (where `t` represents the number of test cases) and evaluates `x` and `y` to produce some output, though the specific output is not detailed in the given information.
