Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons. Here's why:

1. **Space Calculation**: The program calculates `space_x` as `x * 1` and `space_y` as `y * 4`, which is correct. However, the logic to determine the number of screens needed is flawed.

2. **Screen Requirement Calculation**: The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required for the `2x2` icons (`screen_require_for_y`). It should consider that each `2x2` icon takes up 4 cells, and the grid size is `5x3` (15 cells per screen). The correct approach would be to calculate how many full screens are needed for the `2x2` icons and then account for any remaining cells.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**: The program calculates `remaining_cells` as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This calculation is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the placement of `1x1` icons after placing the `2x2` icons.

4. **Final Screen Calculation**: The final screen count calculation is also incorrect. It should ensure that all `1x1` icons fit into the remaining cells after placing the `2x2` icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons
        full_screens_for_2x2 = (y + 3) // 4
        
        # Calculate the number of remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = 15 * full_screens_for_2x2 - (y * 4)
        
        # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining cells
        full_screens_for_1x1 = remaining_cells // 5
        remaining_cells_after_1x1 = remaining_cells % 5
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons
        extra_screens_for_1x1 = (remaining_cells_after_1x1 + 4) // 5
        
        # Total screens needed
        total_screens = full_screens_for_2x2 + full_screens_for_1x1 + extra_screens_for_1x1
        
        result.append(total_screens)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all the icons.
