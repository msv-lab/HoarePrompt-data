#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ m. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: fnd is the count of times tot (which is the sum of the values of the intersection counter D) is greater than or equal to k during the loop iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers) as inputs. It calculates the number of times the sum of the intersection of two counters (D) is greater than or equal to k during the specified operations on the lists a and b. Finally, it prints the count of such occurrences for each test case.
