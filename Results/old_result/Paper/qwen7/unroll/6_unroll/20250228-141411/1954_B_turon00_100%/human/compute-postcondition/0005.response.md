Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \), a list of \( n \) integers \( a \), and an integer \( t \). For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive identical elements in the list \( a \). If the length of the list \( n \) is 1 or all elements in the list are the same, it outputs -1. Otherwise, it outputs the calculated minimum number of consecutive identical elements.**
