### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) when \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It initializes `tmp` to the first element of the array and `cnt` to 0.
   - It iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. When an element differs, it updates `ans` with the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with `cnt`.
   - If the array has only one element or `ans` equals `n`, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of counting consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` and updating `ans` is correct. This approach correctly identifies the longest sequence of identical elements.
   - However, the logic to determine if the array is beautiful and the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program does not actually check if the array is beautiful or if removing elements makes it non-beautiful. Instead, it just counts the longest sequence of identical elements.
   - The program does not handle the condition where the array is already non-beautiful or where removing elements would make it non-beautiful.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the second test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program outputs `1`, which is correct because removing the second element `[1, 2, 1, 2]` results in a non-beautiful array.
   - For the fourth test case `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program outputs `3`, which is correct because removing the first three elements `[5, 3, 3, 3]` results in a non-beautiful array.
   - However, for the first test case `[2, 2, 2]`, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because it does not consider that removing any element would make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the state of the program at different stages, but it does not address the fundamental flaw in the logic.
   - The annotated code states that the program should output the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, but it does not actually implement this logic.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program only counts the longest sequence of identical elements, which does not solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
