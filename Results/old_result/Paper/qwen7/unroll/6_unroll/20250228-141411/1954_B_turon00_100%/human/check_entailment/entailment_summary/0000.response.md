Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting the maximum number of consecutive identical elements. However, the logic to determine whether the array is beautiful and to find the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. Specifically:

1. The program only counts the maximum number of consecutive identical elements but does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array.
2. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the complement of the maximum number of consecutive identical elements, which is not always true.
3. The program does not properly handle the condition where removing elements might still leave the array beautiful after the operation.

Given the execution summary, the program does not accurately implement the solution. It fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array is no longer beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
