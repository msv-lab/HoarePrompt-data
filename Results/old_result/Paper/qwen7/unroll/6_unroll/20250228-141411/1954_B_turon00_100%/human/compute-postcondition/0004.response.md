Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. The function returns whether each test case's array a is beautiful according to the given conditions.**

Note: The actual logic to determine if the array is beautiful is not described here as per the instruction to focus only on the parameters and return value.
