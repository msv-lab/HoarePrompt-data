Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) with the constraint that the sum of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, it processes an array a consisting of n integers, where each integer a_i satisfies -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the given test cases.**

This functionality describes that the function handles multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and an array, and processes these according to the defined constraints.
