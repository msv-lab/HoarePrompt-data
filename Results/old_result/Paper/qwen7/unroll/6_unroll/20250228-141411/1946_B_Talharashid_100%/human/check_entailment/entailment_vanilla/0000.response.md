### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the sum of the array after performing `k` operations.
   - Each operation allows us to insert the sum of any contiguous subarray into the array.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To maximize the sum, we should aim to make as many positive elements as possible, and ideally, we want to create as many positive sums as possible through the operations.
   - The given solution attempts to find the maximum prefix sum (`maxi`) of the array. This is a good start but doesn't fully capture the strategy for maximizing the sum.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code calculates the maximum prefix sum (`maxi`) of the array.
   - It then computes the result using the formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
     - `2 ** k * maxi`: This part aims to amplify the maximum prefix sum by `2 ** k`, which is a reasonable approach since we can add the same positive value multiple times.
     - `- maxi`: This subtracts the maximum prefix sum once, which seems unnecessary.
     - `+ sum(l)`: This adds the original sum of the array.
     - `% 1000000007`: This ensures the result is within the required modulo.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is not entirely correct. The term `- maxi` is redundant and incorrect.
   - The correct approach should be to use `2 ** k * maxi + sum(l)` without subtracting `maxi`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code has a logical error in the formula used to compute the maximum possible sum.
   - The correct formula should be `(2 ** k * maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect due to the redundant and incorrect subtraction of `maxi` in the formula.
