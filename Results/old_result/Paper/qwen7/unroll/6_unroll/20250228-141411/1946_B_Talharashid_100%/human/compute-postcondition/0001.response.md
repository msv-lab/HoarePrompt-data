Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each element a_i. After executing the loop, the output consists of t lines, each containing one integer which is the result of (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007, where maxi is the maximum subarray sum under certain conditions, and sum(l) is the sum of elements in the array l.
