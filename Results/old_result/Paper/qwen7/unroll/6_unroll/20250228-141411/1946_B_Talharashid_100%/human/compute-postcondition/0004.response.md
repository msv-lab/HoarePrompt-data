Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) (indicating the number of subsequent test cases), followed by pairs of positive integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the array \( a \) and the integer \( k \), then prints this value modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The calculated value is derived from the maximum subarray sum under certain conditions and the sum of the array elements.**
