Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer n and a list a of n integers. It determines if the list a is "beautiful" (i.e., all elements in the list are the same). If the list is not beautiful, it calculates the minimum number of consecutive occurrences of any element in the list and prints this value. If the list is beautiful, it prints -1.**
