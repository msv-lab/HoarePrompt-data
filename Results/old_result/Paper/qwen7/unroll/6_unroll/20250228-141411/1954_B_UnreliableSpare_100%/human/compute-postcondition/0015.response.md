Based on the initial state provided:

- `val` is the last element in `arr`.
- `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`.
- `ans` is the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`.
- The flag is `False`.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`. Since `ans` is initialized as the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and no previous value of `ans` is mentioned, we assume `ans` starts with a value that is updated based on `cnt`.

Given that `cnt` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `val` in `arr`, and without additional context about the initial value of `ans`, we can infer that `ans` will hold the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `val` found so far in the array.

However, since the exact value of `ans` is not explicitly provided and depends on the sequence of elements in `arr`, we cannot determine a specific numerical value for `ans`.

Therefore, the output will be based on the computed value of `ans` from the given conditions.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum count of consecutive occurrences of val in arr)**
