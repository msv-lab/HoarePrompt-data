Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), another integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^5), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function returns whether the given list a is beautiful for each test case.**

Note: The function's actual implementation details are not provided here, only the expected behavior based on the input constraints and output conditions.
