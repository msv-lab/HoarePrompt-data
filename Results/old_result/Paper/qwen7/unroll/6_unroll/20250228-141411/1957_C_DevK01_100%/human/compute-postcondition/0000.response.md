Output State: **`dp` is [1, 1], `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and for each move i, `r_i` and `c_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `dp` with the values `[1, 1]`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `r_i`, or `c_i`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
