Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. The logic in the `func_1` function does not accurately model the problem constraints and does not account for the mirrored placements of rooks.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

1. **Initial State**: After \(k\) moves, some rows and columns are occupied.
2. **Mirroring Effect**: Each move you make is mirrored by the computer, reducing the effective number of available positions.
3. **Final Configurations**: The number of ways to place the remaining rooks is determined by the number of unoccupied rows and columns.

Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. **Track Occupied Rows and Columns**: Use sets to keep track of occupied rows and columns.
2. **Calculate Remaining Positions**: For an \(n \times n\) board, if \(k\) moves have been made, the number of unoccupied rows and columns is \(n - 2k\).
3. **Count Configurations**: The number of ways to place the remaining rooks is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{n-2k}{n/2}\) if \(n\) is even, or \(\binom{n-2k}{(n-1)/2} \times 2\) if \(n\) is odd.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from math import comb

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    # Calculate the number of unoccupied rows and columns
    remaining_positions = n - 2 * k
    if remaining_positions < 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    
    # Calculate the number of configurations
    if remaining_positions == 0:
        print(1)
    elif remaining_positions % 2 == 0:
        print(comb(remaining_positions, remaining_positions // 2) % (10**9 + 7))
    else:
        print((comb(remaining_positions, (remaining_positions - 1) // 2) * 2) % (10**9 + 7))
```

This code correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations based on the given constraints and ensures the result is modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
