### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to calculate the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board, but it needs to account for the initial moves and their mirrors.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for _ in range(t):
       L = list(map(int, input().split()))
       (n, k) = (L[0], L[1])
       for j in range(k):
           L1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
           (a, b) = (L1[0], L1[1])
           if a != b:
               n -= 2
           else:
               n -= 1
       print(func_1(n))
       continue
   ```
   - This loop reads the input for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\).
   - It then iterates through the \(k\) moves and updates \(n\) based on whether the move is mirrored or not.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` with the updated \(n\) and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(n):
       dp = [1, 1]
       for i in range(2, n + 1):
           dp += [(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)]
           dp.pop(0)
       return dp[-1]
   ```
   - This function uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks on an \(n \times n\) board.
   - The recurrence relation used in `dp` is designed to count the number of valid configurations.
   - However, the function does not account for the initial moves and their mirrors, which is a critical part of the problem.

#### Correct Approach:
- The function `func_1` should be modified to account for the initial moves and their mirrors.
- Specifically, after each move, the effective size of the board decreases by 2 if the move is mirrored, and by 1 if it is not.
- The function should then compute the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board using combinatorial methods.

#### Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the mirrored placements and the constraints of the problem correctly.
- The function `func_1` alone cannot solve the problem as stated because it does not account for the initial moves and their mirrors.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the initial moves and their mirrors, and the function `func_1` alone cannot solve the problem as stated.
