Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent unless the move is along the diagonal.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and then iterates over the \( k \) moves, updating \( n \) based on whether the move was along the diagonal or not.
   - After processing the moves, it calls the function `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` with the first two elements as `[1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to \( n \), updating `dp` using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`.
   - Finally, it returns the last element of `dp`.

4. **Formula Explanation**:
   - The formula used in `func_1` is derived from combinatorial mathematics and correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an \( n \times n \) board without attacking each other, considering the initial constraints of the problem.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the main loop correctly updates \( n \) based on the moves.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the number of possible final configurations using the provided formula.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
