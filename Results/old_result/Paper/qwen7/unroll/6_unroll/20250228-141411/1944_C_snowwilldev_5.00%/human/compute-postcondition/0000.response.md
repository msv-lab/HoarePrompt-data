Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case involves the variable `tc` which is used to iterate over the test cases.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `tc`**: The loop will start with `tc` set to 0 because the `range(int(input()))` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to (but not including) the value of `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `tc` is less than the number of test cases. Therefore, `tc` must be less than the number of test cases.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `tc` starts at 0 and the loop will execute as long as `tc` is less than the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `tc` is initialized to 0 and that the number of test cases is correctly read from input.

Given the initial state information:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
- This means there are `t` test cases.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect that `tc` is 0 and the number of test cases is `t`.

**Final State**:
State: **`tc` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\)**
