### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It reads the size of the array `N` and the elements of `a`.
   - It uses a dictionary `cnt` to count occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the counts and increments `t` whenever an element appears exactly once.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or if an element count becomes zero, it prints the current index `i`.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The code does not simulate the game correctly. It does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is flawed because it does not consider the optimal moves of both players.
   - The code does not handle the game dynamics where Alice can strategically pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob can strategically remove elements to minimize it.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always pick the largest available element to minimize the MEX.
   - The optimal strategy involves keeping track of the smallest and largest elements available at each turn.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the game rules and does not simulate the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
