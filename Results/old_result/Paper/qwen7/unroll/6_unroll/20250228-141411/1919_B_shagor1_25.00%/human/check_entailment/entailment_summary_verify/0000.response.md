### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem statement carefully.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - The goal is to minimize the total penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should output the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes a single test case.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
   - It calculates the result using the formula `n - 2 * neg`, where `neg` is the count of '-' characters.
   - If `n` equals `neg`, it returns `n`; otherwise, it returns `n - 2 * neg`.

3. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of '-' characters (`neg`) in the string `s`.
   - It then calculates the result using the formula `n - 2 * neg` and prints it.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy involves splitting the array into segments such that the sum of the absolute values of these segments is minimized.
   - The program's approach of counting '-' characters and using the formula `n - 2 * neg` does not necessarily lead to the optimal solution.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     10
     --+++++++-
     ```
   - The program would output `5` because there are 5 negative signs, leading to `10 - 2 * 5 = 0`.
   - However, the optimal solution is to split the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in a penalty of `2 * 2 + 0 * 10 = 4`.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for calculating the minimum possible penalty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly and does not follow the optimal strategy for minimizing the penalty.
