Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only counts the number of negative signs in the string and uses this to compute the penalty. However, the optimal strategy involves splitting the array into segments such that the sum of the absolute values of these segments is minimized.

For example, consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
The program would output `5` because there are 5 negative signs, leading to `10 - 2 * 5 = 0`. However, the optimal solution is to split the array into `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1])`, which results in a penalty of `2 * 2 + 0 * 10 = 4`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and hence is incorrect.
