Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '+' and '-', `neg` is 0.**

The variable `neg` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
