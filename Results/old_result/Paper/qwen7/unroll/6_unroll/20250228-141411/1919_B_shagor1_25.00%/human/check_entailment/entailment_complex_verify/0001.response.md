### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string \(s\)) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The program should output the minimum possible penalty for each test case.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \(n\) and the string \(s\).
   - It then counts the number of '-' characters in the string \(s\), storing this count in the variable `neg`.
   - Finally, it prints the result of the expression `n - 2 * neg` if \(n \neq neg\); otherwise, it prints `n`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1()` processes one test case by counting the number of '-' characters and then applying the formula `n - 2 * neg`.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is indeed correct for calculating the minimum penalty when the array is split optimally.
   - This formula works because:
     - Each '-' character contributes `-1` to the sum of the array.
     - Each '+' character contributes `1` to the sum of the array.
     - The optimal way to split the array is to group all '-' characters together and all '+' characters together, which results in a sum of `n - 2 * neg`.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` ensures that the penalty is minimized by considering the worst-case scenario where all '-' characters are grouped together and all '+' characters are grouped together.

5. **Examples**:
   - For the test case `5` with input `-----`, the program correctly outputs `5` because `n = 5` and `neg = 5`, so `n - 2 * neg = 5 - 2 * 5 = 5`.
   - For the test case `6` with input `+-+-+-`, the program correctly outputs `6` because `n = 6` and `neg = 3`, so `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 3 = 0`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as stated.
