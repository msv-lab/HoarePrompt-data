### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \(N\) and the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It then calls `func_2()` for each test case.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes two integers \(a\) and \(b\) and returns the product of \(a\) and \(b\) divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - Given the constraints \(2 \leq b \leq 20\) and \(1 \leq a \leq 10^9\), this function correctly computes the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - It initializes `den` with the first multiplier and updates `den` by computing the LCM with each subsequent multiplier using `func_1`.
   - After computing the LCM, it calculates the required amounts to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by each multiplier.
   - It then subtracts the sum of these required amounts from the LCM to get the remaining value `den`.
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the required amounts to bet on each outcome.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the requirement to find a distribution of coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - The use of LCM ensures that the distribution is feasible within the given constraints.
   - The code handles the edge case where the total bet cannot be less than the winnings for any outcome by printing `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
