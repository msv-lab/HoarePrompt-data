The function reads two lines of input: the first line contains an integer \(N\) representing the number of elements in the list, and the second line contains \(N\) space-separated integers. It then calculates a value `den` by successively applying a function `func_1` to the first element of the list and each subsequent element. After that, it computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding element in the input list, performs a subtraction operation on `den`, and checks if the result is less than or equal to zero. If so, it prints `-1` and terminates without returning any value. Otherwise, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string.
