### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula: \(\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)}\).
- The implementation is correct and uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function processes the input for a single test case.
- It reads the number of outcomes `N` and the multipliers `k_i` for each outcome.
- It initializes `den` with the first multiplier value.
- It iterates through all multipliers and updates `den` using `func_1` to find the least common multiple of all multipliers.
- It then computes `vprod` as the list of values where each element is `den // r` for each multiplier `r`.
- It calculates `den - sum(vprod)` to find the remaining value after distributing the bets according to the computed multipliers.
- If the remaining value `den` is less than or equal to zero, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
- Otherwise, it prints the bets as a space-separated string of integers.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Multiplier Calculation**:
   - The initialization of `den` with the first multiplier is correct.
   - Using `func_1` to update `den` by finding the LCM of all multipliers is also correct because the LCM ensures that the total bet is a multiple of each individual bet required to match the multipliers.

2. **Bet Distribution**:
   - The computation of `vprod` as `den // r` for each multiplier `r` is correct because it ensures that the total bet is evenly distributed among the multipliers.
   - However, the check `den - sum(vprod)` is flawed. The goal is to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets. Instead, the current check only ensures that the total bet is less than or equal to the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets, which does not guarantee a strict inequality.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.
   - The program outputs the correct bets when a valid distribution exists, but the check for the strict inequality is incorrect.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```
- The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42.
- The bets would be calculated as `42 // 3`, `42 // 2`, and `42 // 7`, which are 14, 21, and 6 respectively.
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than `3*14 + 2*21 + 7*6 = 84`.
- However, the program would print `14 21 6` because `42 - (14 + 21 + 6) = 42 - 41 = 1 > 0`.

This example shows that the program does not strictly enforce the condition that the total bet must be strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find a valid distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the sum of the multipliers times their respective bets. The check `den - sum(vprod)` is not sufficient to ensure the strict inequality.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
