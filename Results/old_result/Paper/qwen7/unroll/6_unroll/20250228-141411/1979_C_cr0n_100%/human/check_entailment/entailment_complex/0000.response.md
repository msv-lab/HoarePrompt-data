Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to distribute coins across different outcomes in such a way that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. 

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - This function takes two parameters `a` and `b` where `1 <= a <= 10^9` and `2 <= b <= 20`.
   - It returns the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - This function is used to compute a common denominator for the subsequent steps.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of outcomes `N` and a list of multipliers `vals`.
   - It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals` and updates `den` by applying `func_1` successively with each subsequent element in `vals`. This step effectively finds the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers.
   - It then computes a list `vprod` where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier in `vals`.
   - It subtracts the sum of `vprod` from `den` and checks if the result is non-negative. If it is, it prints the elements of `vprod` as a space-separated string; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_1`.
   - It then distributes the coins such that the total bet is less than the sum of the winnings for each outcome.
   - The check `if (den - sum(vprod)) <= 0` ensures that the total bet is indeed less than the sum of the winnings for any outcome.

Given the analysis, the provided implementation correctly solves the problem as described.
