Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
- For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we receive back \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\).

### Analysis of `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - `N` is read as the number of outcomes.
   - A list of multipliers \(k_i\) is read.

2. **Calculating `den`**:
   - `den` is initialized to the first multiplier.
   - For each subsequent multiplier, `func_1` is applied to update `den`. This function essentially finds the least common multiple (LCM) of the current `den` and the next multiplier.

3. **Computing `vprod`**:
   - `vprod` is computed as a list where each element is `den` divided by the corresponding multiplier \(k_i\).

4. **Subtracting the Sum of `vprod` from `den`**:
   - `den` is updated to `den - sum(vprod)`.

5. **Checking and Printing**:
   - If `den` is less than or equal to zero, `-1` is printed.
   - Otherwise, the elements of `vprod` are printed.

### Verification:
- **Correctness of LCM Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly calculates the least common multiple of two numbers using their greatest common divisor (GCD). This ensures that `den` is the smallest number that is divisible by all multipliers.
- **Distributing Coins**: The `vprod` list represents the optimal distribution of coins such that the total bet is minimized while ensuring that the condition is met.
- **Ensuring Strict Inequality**: By subtracting the sum of `vprod` from `den`, the code ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Given that the logic in `func_2` aligns with the problem requirements and the steps are logically sound, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
