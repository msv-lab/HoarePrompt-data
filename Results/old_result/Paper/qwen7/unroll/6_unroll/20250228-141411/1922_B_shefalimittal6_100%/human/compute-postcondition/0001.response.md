Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `input()`, which is now specified to be `sys.stdin.read`, and splits it into a list of strings using `split()`. This operation does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Instead, it creates a new variable `data` that contains the split input.
