Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is defined as `2 + 2*t`.
   - `t` is simply `t`.
   - `n` is an integer from `data[0]`.
   - `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that `0 ≤ a_i ≤ n`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `results` is a list of strings where each string is the result of the calculation for each iteration of the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

Given the above, the `'\n'.join(results)` operation will join all the strings in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) between each string. This means that each string in the `results` list will be printed on a new line.

Since the exact contents of `results` are not specified, we can only describe the general form of the output. Each element in `results` will be printed on a new line.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **each string in the `results` list, each on a new line**
