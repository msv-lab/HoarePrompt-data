Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer from `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `idx`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `data` remain unchanged, and a new empty list `results` is added to the state.
