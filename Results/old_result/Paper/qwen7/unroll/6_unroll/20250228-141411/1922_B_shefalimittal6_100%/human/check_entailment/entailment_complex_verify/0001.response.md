### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step by step to confirm the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This correctly handles the input format where multiple test cases are provided.
   - The program then iterates through the list to extract the necessary values (`t`, `n`, and the array `a`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes an array `v` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each stick length.
   - It correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length and stores them in `v`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triangles**:
   - The program uses a variable `cnt` to keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - For each stick length `i`:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of length `i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{v[i]}{2} = \frac{v[i] \times (v[i] - 1)}{2} \).
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of length `i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{v[i]}{3} = \frac{v[i] \times (v[i] - 1) \times (v[i] - 2)}{6} \).
   - It updates `cnt` with the current count of sticks of length `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program collects the answers for each test case and prints them joined by newlines, which matches the required output format.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles from the given sticks. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
