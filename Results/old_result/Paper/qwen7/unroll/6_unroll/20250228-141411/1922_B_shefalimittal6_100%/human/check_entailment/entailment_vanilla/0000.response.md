Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It iterates through the list to extract the necessary values (`t`, `n`, and the array `a`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it initializes an array `v` of size `n+1` to count occurrences of each stick length.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each stick length and stores them in `v`.

3. **Calculating the Number of Valid Triangles**:
   - The program uses a variable `cnt` to keep track of the cumulative count of sticks.
   - For each stick length `i`:
     - If there are at least 2 sticks of length `i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 out of these sticks and adds it to the answer.
     - If there are at least 3 sticks of length `i`, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 out of these sticks and adds it to the answer.
   - It updates `cnt` with the current count of sticks of length `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program collects the answers for each test case and prints them joined by newlines.

### Correctness Check

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in a way that matches the problem statement.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each stick length.

3. **Triangle Formation**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of ways to form triangles is correct. It uses combinations to count the valid sets of 3 sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle.

4. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement, printing the number of ways for each test case.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is correct and follows the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
