Based on the initial state provided:

- `pergunta` is the minimum value obtained by comparing `x + a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to `n-1`.
- `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to 0.

To determine what will be printed, let's break down the components:

1. **Value of `x`:**
   - `x` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for all `i` from `n-1` to 0.
   - This means `x` starts with the minimum of `a[n-1]` and `b[n-1]`, then adds the next minimum value of `a[i]` and `b[i]` for each `i` from `n-2` to 0.

2. **Value of `pergunta`:**
   - `pergunta` is the minimum value obtained by comparing `x + a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to `n-1`.
   - For each `i` in this range, we calculate `x + a[i]` and take the minimum of these values.

Given these definitions, `pergunta` will be the smallest value among `x + a[i]` for all `i` from `m-1` to `n-1`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `pergunta`.

Output: **pergunta (where pergunta is the minimum value obtained by comparing x + a[i] for all i from m-1 to n-1, and x is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of a[i] and b[i] for all i from n-1 to 0)**
