Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.
3. The function `func_1` is defined to calculate the minimum cost required for Kirill to move within the first `m` positions.
4. The function iterates backward from `n-1` to `m`, updating the cumulative sum `x` by adding the minimum of the current elements in `a` and `b`.
5. It also updates the variable `pergunta` to store the minimum value between `x + a[i]` and the current value of `pergunta` for each iteration.
6. The logic seems to correctly account for the costs associated with moving Kirill to different positions and ensures that the minimum cost is calculated.
7. The final result is printed for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
