State: **`a` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array, `num2` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `num2`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, num2)` will start with `i` as 1 and increment `i` until `i` is less than `num2`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `num2` must be greater than 1 because the range starts from 1.
4. The initial value of `i` in the first iteration of the loop is 1.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `num2` is greater than 1 and `i` is set to 1.
