### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To achieve this, we should sort the array and arrange it such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(a, num2)` to check if the array is already in a non-decreasing order.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints `0` because no rearrangement is needed.
   - Otherwise, it sorts the array and calculates the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order by counting the number of adjacent pairs where the previous element is greater than or equal to the current element.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - If the array is already sorted, the beauty is indeed `0` because \((a_i - a_{i-1}) = 0\) for all \(i\).
   - If the array is not sorted, sorting it ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the correct calculation of the beauty.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also correctly calculates the beauty after sorting the array.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by either checking if the array is already sorted or sorting it if necessary. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
