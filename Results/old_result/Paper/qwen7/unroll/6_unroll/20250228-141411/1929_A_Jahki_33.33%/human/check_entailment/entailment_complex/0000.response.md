Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty can be maximized by rearranging the elements such that the differences are maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest possible elements, thus maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, the function returns `True`, indicating no rearrangement is needed.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating some rearrangement is required.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It reads the array elements and sorts them.
   - It calculates the beauty by summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, the beauty is `0` because the array is already sorted.
   - Otherwise, the beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies whether the array needs to be rearranged.
   - The calculation of the beauty after sorting is correct.
   - The handling of the `func_1` result is appropriate.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
