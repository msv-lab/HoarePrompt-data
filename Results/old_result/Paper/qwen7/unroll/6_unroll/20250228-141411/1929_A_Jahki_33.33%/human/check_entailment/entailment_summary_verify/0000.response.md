### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and the logic step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It returns `True` if the array is sorted and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is unnecessary for calculating the maximum beauty, as the goal is to maximize the sum of differences between adjacent elements, not to check if the array is sorted.

2. **Main Logic Flow:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It then sorts the array and calculates the beauty using the sorted array.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

3. **Issue with Sorting Approach:**
   - The main logic assumes that sorting the entire array will always yield the maximum beauty.
   - However, this is not necessarily true. To achieve the maximum beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, and then sort the rest of the array accordingly.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     4
     1 2 3 4
     ```
   - The expected output is `5` because the maximum beauty is achieved by rearranging the array to `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `(4-1) + (3-2) = 5`.
   - However, the given program would sort the array to `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and compute the beauty as `(2-1) + (3-2) + (4-3) = 3`, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To achieve the maximum beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, and then sort the rest of the array.
   - This can be done by placing the minimum and maximum elements at the ends and then sorting the remaining elements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The main logic flow incorrectly assumes that sorting the entire array will always yield the maximum beauty, which is not true. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
