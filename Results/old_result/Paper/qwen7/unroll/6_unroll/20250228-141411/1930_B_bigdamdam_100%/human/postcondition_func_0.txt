The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3) and an integer \( n \) (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it generates a list \( p \) of length \( n \), where elements at even indices are filled with numbers in descending order starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2, and elements at odd indices are filled with numbers in ascending order starting from 1 plus the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 2, incrementing by 2. The function then prints the generated list \( p \) for each test case.
