Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to check if the generated permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \).

Let's analyze the logic of the provided code:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, it reads \( n \), the length of the permutation \( p \).
2. **Generating the Permutation**:
   - For even indices, the program fills the permutation with numbers in descending order starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2.
   - For odd indices, the program fills the permutation with numbers in ascending order starting from 1 plus the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 2, incrementing by 2.
3. **Output**: The program prints the generated permutation \( p \) for each test case.

Now, let's verify if this approach ensures that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) exist such that \( p_i \) divides \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) divides \( p_{j+1} \):

- **Even Indices**: The values at even indices are \( n, n-2, n-4, \ldots \).
- **Odd Indices**: The values at odd indices are \( 1 + (n \mod 2), 3 + (n \mod 2), 5 + (n \mod 2), \ldots \).

Since the values at even indices are strictly decreasing and the values at odd indices are strictly increasing, and they are separated by at least one value (since \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) are always of different parities), it is impossible for \( p_i \) to divide \( p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \) to divide \( p_{j+1} \) because the sequences are disjoint in terms of divisibility due to their monotonic nature and separation.

Therefore, the given program correctly generates a permutation that satisfies the required conditions.

Correctness: **True**
