### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that no two distinct indices \( i \) and \( j \) (with \( 1 \leq i, j < n \) and \( i \neq j \)) satisfy \( p_i \mid p_j \) and \( p_{i+1} \mid p_{j+1} \).

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
        p = [0] * n
        ind = n
        for i in range(0, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind -= 2
        ind = 1 + n % 2
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            p[i] = ind
            ind += 2
        print(*p)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) (1 ≤ \( t \) ≤ 10^3) and an integer \( n \) (3 ≤ \( n \) ≤ 10^5).
- For each test case, it generates a list \( p \) of length \( n \), where elements at even indices are filled with numbers in descending order starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2, and elements at odd indices are filled with numbers in ascending order starting from 1 plus the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 2, incrementing by 2.
- The function then prints the generated list \( p \) for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
- Correctness: **False**.
- Explanation: The provided program does not generate a permutation that satisfies the given condition for all possible inputs. Specifically, for \( n = 6 \), the permutation generated is `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which violates the condition since \( 6 \mid 4 \) and \( 5 \mid 3 \).

#### Analysis:
1. **Permutation Construction**:
   - For even indices: The numbers are placed in descending order starting from \( n \) and decrementing by 2.
   - For odd indices: The numbers are placed in ascending order starting from 1 plus the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 2 and incrementing by 2.

2. **Checking the Condition**:
   - Let's check the generated permutation for \( n = 6 \): `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
     - \( p_1 = 6 \) and \( p_3 = 4 \): \( 6 \mid 4 \) (False).
     - \( p_2 = 5 \) and \( p_4 = 3 \): \( 5 \mid 3 \) (False).
   - This permutation does not violate the condition.

3. **General Case**:
   - For any \( n \), the construction ensures that the numbers at even indices are larger than those at odd indices, and the numbers at odd indices are smaller than those at even indices.
   - This construction guarantees that no two adjacent pairs will have the divisibility condition violated because the even indices will always have larger numbers than the odd indices.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs a permutation that satisfies the given condition for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the given constraints.
