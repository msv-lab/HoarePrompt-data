Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns a specific output based on the values of `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases defined by `t`, and for each case, it processes `x` and `y` to produce a result. However, since the exact processing logic isn't provided, the focus is on the structure and nature of the inputs and outputs.
