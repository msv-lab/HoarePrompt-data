Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The problem requires calculating the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of a subarray, which is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray. However, the code attempts to calculate a different value `sm` which is not related to MEX.

2. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The functions `func_2` and `func_3` do not correctly apply the operations to maximize the sum of the array. They seem to be attempting to recursively apply operations but do not correctly compute the MEX or update the array values.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It tries to find indices `r` and `l` that maximize some sum involving squares, which is not relevant to the MEX operation or maximizing the sum of the array.

To solve this problem correctly, one would need to:
- Compute the MEX of any subarray.
- Apply operations to make all elements in a subarray equal to the MEX of that subarray.
- Ensure the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum of the array.

A correct approach would involve iterating through possible subarrays, computing their MEX, and applying operations to set all elements in those subarrays to the computed MEX.
