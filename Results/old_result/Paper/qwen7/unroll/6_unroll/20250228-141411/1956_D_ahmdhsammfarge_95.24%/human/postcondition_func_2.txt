The function accepts four parameters: `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`. `r` and `l` are integers with the constraint that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and `lst` is a list of non-negative integers. `ops` is a list used to store operations. The function first appends the same operation twice to the `ops` list, then calls another function `func_2(r, l, ops)`. It calculates the length `n` of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`, replaces this sublist with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`, and finally returns the modified list. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation is appended twice; otherwise, it is appended once.
