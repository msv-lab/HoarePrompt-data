Postcondition: `ops` is a list containing the elements `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then the condition holds as specified. If the minimum value is not 0, the condition still holds but no additional changes are made to `ops`.
