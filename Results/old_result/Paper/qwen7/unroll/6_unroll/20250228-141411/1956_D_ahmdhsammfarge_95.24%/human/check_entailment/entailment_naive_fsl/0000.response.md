Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to find the subarray that, when modified, would yield the maximum sum. However, it calculates the sum incorrectly. It sums the elements before and after the subarray and adds `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not relevant to the problem. The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value should be computed for each subarray and used to update the subarray, but this function does not do that.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to recursively apply operations, but it does not correctly handle the operations needed to maximize the sum. It simply appends operations without considering the MEX value.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function also does not correctly implement the logic. It appends operations without updating the array based on the MEX value, and it does not handle the subarray updates properly.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
