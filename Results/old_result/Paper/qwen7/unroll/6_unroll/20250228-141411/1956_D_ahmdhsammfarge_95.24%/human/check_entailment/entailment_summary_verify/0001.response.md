### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to maximize the sum of the array elements using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves setting all elements in a subarray from index `l` to `r` to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
- The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

#### Function Summaries Recap
1. **Function `func_3`:**
   - Accepts `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`.
   - Appends the same operation twice to `ops`.
   - Calls `func_2(r, l, ops)`.
   - Calculates the length `n` of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`.
   - Replaces this sublist with a list of `n` elements, each being `n`.
   - Returns the modified list.
   - If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the operation is appended twice; otherwise, it is appended once.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Recursively generates a sequence of operations to set the entire array to a specific value.
   - Called within `func_3`.

#### Detailed Evaluation
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the MEX value and instead sums elements in a way that doesn't align with the problem requirements. This function is not used in the final solution, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` is designed to set the subarray `lst[r:l + 1]` to the MEX value and then recursively call itself to ensure the entire array is set to this value.
   - The function correctly identifies the MEX value by checking the minimum value in the subarray and handling the special case where the minimum value is 0.
   - The function then sets the subarray to the MEX value and updates the array accordingly.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is a helper function that generates a sequence of operations to set the entire array to a specific value.
   - It is called within `func_3` to ensure the entire array is set to the MEX value.

Given the correct implementation of `func_3` and `func_2`, the program should correctly maximize the sum of the array elements by setting the entire array to the MEX value of the initial array.

### Final Evaluation
Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting the entire array to the MEX value. The function summaries accurately describe the behavior of the functions, and there are no logical errors in the implementation.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
