Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the elements `[l + 2, l + 2]`, `[l + 2, l + 2]`, `[l + 2, l + 2]`, and `[l + 2, l + 1]`, `n` is `l - r + 1`, and the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced by a list of `n` elements, each being `n`.**

Explanation: The code `lst[r:l + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]` replaces the slice of the list `lst` from index `r` to `l + 1` (inclusive) with a list containing `n` elements, each element being `n`. Given that `n` is `l - r + 1`, the slice `lst[r:l + 1]` is replaced by a list of `l - r + 1` elements, each being `l - r + 1`. The values of `ops` are updated because the indices `r` and `l` are used to define the slice, and the value of `n` remains unchanged.
