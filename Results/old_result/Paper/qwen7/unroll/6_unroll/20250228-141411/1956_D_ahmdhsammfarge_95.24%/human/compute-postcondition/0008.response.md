Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the elements `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `[r + 1, r + 1]`, and `[r + 1, l + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`**.

Explanation: The list `ops` initially contains three elements, each being a list `[r + 1, r + 1]`. After executing the line `ops.append([r + 1, l + 1])`, the list `ops` now contains one additional element `[r + 1, l + 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `r` and `l` maintaining their original conditions.
