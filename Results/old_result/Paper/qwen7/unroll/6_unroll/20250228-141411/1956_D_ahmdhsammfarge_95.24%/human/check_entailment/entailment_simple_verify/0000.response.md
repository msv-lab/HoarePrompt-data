### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function aims to find the subarray indices `r` and `l` that maximize the sum of the array when modified.
- The current implementation calculates `sm` as `sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2`. This calculation is incorrect because it does not consider the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of the subarray `lst[i:j+1]`.
- The MEX value should be computed for each subarray and used to update the subarray to this value, which maximizes the sum.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function is supposed to recursively apply operations, but it does not correctly handle the operations needed to maximize the sum.
- It simply appends operations without considering the MEX value. The operations should update the subarray to the MEX value of that subarray.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function also does not correctly implement the logic. It appends operations without updating the array based on the MEX value, and it does not handle the subarray updates properly.
- The function should update the subarray to the MEX value of that subarray, but it currently does not do this.

Given these observations, the original assessment is correct. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The functions do not compute the MEX value for each subarray and update the subarray accordingly to maximize the sum.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements using the allowed operations.
