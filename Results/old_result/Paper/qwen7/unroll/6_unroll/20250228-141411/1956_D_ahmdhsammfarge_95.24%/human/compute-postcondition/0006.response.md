Output State: **`ops` is a list containing the elements `[r + 1, r + 1]` and `[r + 1, r + 1]`, `r` is an integer, `l` is an integer such that `0 <= l <= r < len(lst)`, and now `ops` has an additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the list `[r + 1, r + 1]` to the list `ops`. Initially, `ops` contains two elements `[r + 1, l + 1]` and `[r + 1, l + 1]`. After executing the code, `ops` now includes an additional element `[r + 1, r + 1]`. The conditions on `r` and `l` remain unchanged.
