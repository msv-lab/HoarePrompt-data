Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, k is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and a is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. After the loop executes all the iterations, the values of k, x, and a may change based on user input within the loop, but the value of t remains unchanged. The variable s is updated inside the loop and its final value depends on the inputs k, x, and a for each iteration. The loop prints 'Yes' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'No'.
