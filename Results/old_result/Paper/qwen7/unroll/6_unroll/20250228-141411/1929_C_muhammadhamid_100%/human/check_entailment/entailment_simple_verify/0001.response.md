### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

Now, let's verify the logic:

- **Formula Analysis**:
  - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` seems to be intended to simulate Sasha's betting strategy.
  - For each iteration of the loop, `s` is updated by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.
  - This means `s` grows exponentially, which aligns with the idea of Sasha increasing his bet size after each win.

- **Example Verification**:
  - Let's check the first example:
    - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
    - The loop runs once: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Since `a = 7` and `s = 3`, the condition `a >= s` is true, so the output is "Yes".
  - Let's check the second example:
    - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
    - The loop runs once: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Since `a = 1` and `s = 3`, the condition `a >= s` is false, so the output is "No".

- **General Case**:
  - For any `k` and `x`, the value of `s` after `x` iterations will be significantly larger than `a` for most values of `a` and `k`.
  - However, the critical issue lies in the fact that the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` does not necessarily guarantee that Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n`. The formula only calculates the maximum number of coins Sasha can have after `x` consecutive wins, but it does not account for the possibility of losing more than `x` times in a row, which is a crucial constraint.

- **Counterexample**:
  - Consider the case where `k = 2`, `x = 3`, and `a = 1`. According to the formula, after 3 iterations, `s` would be:
    - `s = 1 + (1 // 1 + 1) + (2 // 1 + 1) + (3 // 1 + 1) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
    - However, if Sasha loses the first two bets, he will not be able to place the third bet because he will have 0 coins left. Therefore, he cannot guarantee having 10 coins, let alone any number of coins greater than 10.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of having any number of coins. The formula used to calculate `s` does not account for the possibility of losing more than `x` times in a row, which is a critical constraint.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
