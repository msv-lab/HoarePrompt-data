### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Calculation of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 1.
   - A loop runs from 0 to `x-1` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, `s` is updated using the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - The program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `s`.
   - If `a >= s`, it prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

Now, let's verify the logic:

- **Formula Analysis**:
  - The formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` seems to be intended to simulate Sasha's betting strategy.
  - For each iteration of the loop, `s` is updated by adding the result of `s // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.
  - This means `s` grows exponentially, which aligns with the idea of Sasha increasing his bet size after each win.

- **Example Verification**:
  - Let's check the first example:
    - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 7`
    - The loop runs once: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Since `a = 7` and `s = 3`, the condition `a >= s` is true, so the output is "Yes".
  - Let's check the second example:
    - `k = 2`, `x = 1`, `a = 1`
    - The loop runs once: `s = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
    - Since `a = 1` and `s = 3`, the condition `a >= s` is false, so the output is "No".

- **General Case**:
  - For any `k` and `x`, the value of `s` after `x` iterations will be significantly larger than `a` for most values of `a` and `k`.
  - The formula ensures that Sasha can potentially grow his number of coins exponentially, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of having any number of coins.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
