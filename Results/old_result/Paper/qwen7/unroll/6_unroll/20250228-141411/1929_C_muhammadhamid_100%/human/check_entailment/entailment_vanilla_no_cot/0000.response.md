Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sasha's Strategy:**
   - The program calculates `s` using a loop where `s` is incremented based on the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. This approach does not accurately represent Sasha's betting strategy.
   - The intended strategy involves Sasha placing bets in such a way that he can recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` times in a row while ensuring he can eventually win enough coins to reach any desired amount `n`.

2. **Misunderstanding of the Problem:**
   - The program assumes that Sasha can always win after a certain number of bets, which is not necessarily true. The problem requires a strategy that guarantees Sasha can achieve any number of coins `n` given the constraints.

3. **Simplified Incorrect Logic:**
   - The simplified logic in the program does not account for the complex betting strategy needed to ensure Sasha can recover from losses and eventually win any amount of coins.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- **Initial Bet Calculation:** Sasha should start with a small bet and increase it strategically.
- **Recovery Strategy:** Ensure that Sasha can recover from a sequence of losses up to `x` times in a row.
- **Guaranteed Win:** Determine if Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any desired amount `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        # Check if Sasha can guarantee to win any number of coins
        # Based on the problem constraints, if a > (k-1)**x, Sasha can guarantee to win
        if a > (k - 1) ** x:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected program checks if the initial amount of coins `a` is greater than `(k-1)**x`, which ensures that Sasha can recover from any sequence of losses up to `x` times and eventually win enough coins to reach any desired amount `n`.
