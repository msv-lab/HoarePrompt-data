Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.
3. It calculates the minimum number of coins `s` required to ensure that Sasha can win any number of coins given the constraints. This calculation is done using the formula:
   \[
   s = 1 + \left(1 + \frac{1}{k-1} + \frac{1}{(k-1)^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{(k-1)^{x-1}}\right)
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   s = 1 + \frac{(k-1)^x - 1}{(k-1)}
   \]
4. The program checks if Sasha's initial number of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If so, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Sasha can achieve his goal. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
5. The logic and calculations in the program align with the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
