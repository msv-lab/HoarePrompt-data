Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input().strip(' '))` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, the input must also adhere to this constraint. Therefore, `t` is now set to the integer value of the input provided by the user, maintaining the range specified.
