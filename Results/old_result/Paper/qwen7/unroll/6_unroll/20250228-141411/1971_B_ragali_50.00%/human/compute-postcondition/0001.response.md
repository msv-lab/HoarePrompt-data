State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 1000 (inclusive).
3. The variable `i` starts from 0 in the `range(t)` function, but the problem asks us to adjust the state for the loop to execute, which means we need to ensure that the loop can start.
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute at least once, and `i` should be set to 1 to reflect its initial value in the context of the loop's execution.

Thus, the required state adjustments are that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 1.
