Postcondition: **`nw` and `cw` are both False, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of previous elements in the list, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the if condition `cw` is true or false, both `nw` and `cw` will be False after the execution of the if-else block. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, and `ls`) retain their initial states as described in the precondition.
