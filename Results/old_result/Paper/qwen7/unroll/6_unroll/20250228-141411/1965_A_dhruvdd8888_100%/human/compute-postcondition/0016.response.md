Based on the initial state provided:

- `nw` is `False`
- `cw` is `False`
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `N` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of previous elements in the list
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list
- The condition `(cw)` is false

The `print` statement in question is:

```python
print('Bob')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'Bob'`.

Output: **Bob**
