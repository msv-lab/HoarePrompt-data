Output State: `nw` is False, `cw` is False, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of previous elements in the list, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list.

Explanation: The loop iterates from the second last element to the first element of the `nums` list. If `nums[i]` is 1, `cw` toggles the value of `nw`. Otherwise, `cw` is set to `True`. Since `nw` starts as `True` and `cw` is initially `True`, and given that the loop will eventually reach an index where `nums[i]` is not 1 (as the list is finite and non-empty), `nw` will end up being `False` and `cw` will also be `False` after all iterations. The other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, and `ls`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
