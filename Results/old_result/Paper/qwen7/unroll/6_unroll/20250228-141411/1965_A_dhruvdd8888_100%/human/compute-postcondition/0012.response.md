Output State: `nw` is False, `cw` is False, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 2⋅10^5, `nums` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order where each element has been decremented by the cumulative sum of previous elements in the list, and `ls` is the sum of all elements in the modified `nums` list.

Explanation: The loop iterates from the second last element to the first element of the `nums` list. If `nums[i]` is equal to 1, `cw` toggles the value of `nw`. Otherwise, `cw` is set to `True`. Since the loop starts from the second last element and moves towards the first, and given that `nw` is initially `True`, it will toggle to `False` on encountering the first `1` in the list (if any), and then remain `False` for the rest of the iterations. `cw` will follow the same pattern but will start with the value of `nw` after the first iteration. Therefore, both `nw` and `cw` will end up being `False` after all iterations, assuming there is at least one `1` in the list; otherwise, they would still be `True`. However, without specific values in `nums`, we can only definitively say they will be `False` if there is at least one `1` in the list.
