Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The solution should handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it needs to generate a sequence of `n` numbers whose sum is `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

3. **Analyze the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input string into `n` and `k`.
   - It constructs an array `arr` containing indices corresponding to the bits set in `k`'s binary representation.
   - It then constructs the output array `ans` by setting the appropriate bit positions to 1 (using `1 << i`) and filling the rest with zeros.
   - Finally, it ensures the length of `ans` is `n` by appending zeros if necessary.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `n` is 1 by directly setting the value to `k`.
   - It correctly fills the array `ans` with the required values to satisfy both the sum condition and the bitwise OR condition.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The code correctly handles all given constraints and examples provided.

Conclusion:
The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
