The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs. It then constructs a list `ans` containing `n` elements. Each element in `ans` is set to a power of 2 based on the binary representation of `k`. If the binary representation of `k` has fewer bits than `n`, the remaining elements in `ans` are filled with zeros. Finally, it prints the constructed list `ans` for each test case.
