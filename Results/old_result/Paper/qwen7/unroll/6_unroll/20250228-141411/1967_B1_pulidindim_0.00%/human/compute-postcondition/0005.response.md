Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calculates a value \( ans \) based on these inputs using a specific algorithm involving a loop that updates \( ans \) iteratively. Finally, it prints the computed value \( ans \) for each test case.**
