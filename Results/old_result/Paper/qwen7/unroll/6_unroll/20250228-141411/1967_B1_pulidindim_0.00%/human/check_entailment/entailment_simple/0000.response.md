Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes `t` with the number of test cases and iterates through each test case using a for loop.

2. **Input Reading**: For each test case, it correctly reads `n` and `m` from the input.

3. **Count Initialization**: The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which seems to be a mistake since the problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. The correct initial value should be 1.

4. **Loop Logic**: The loop starts from `count = 2` and increments `count` by 1 in each iteration. Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem requirements. It then calculates `g` as `n / count`, which is also incorrect because `g` should be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

5. **Condition Check**: The condition `if g < countmins:` is incorrect and unnecessary. The problem does not require checking this condition.

6. **Answer Calculation**: The formula `ans += g / count + 1` is incorrect. The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` and checking the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

7. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is incorrect due to the above issues.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
