Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed and does not accurately count the valid pairs.

2. **Misunderstanding of Conditions**: The program tries to increment `ans` based on some arithmetic operations that do not correctly reflect the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the calculation `g -= countmins; ans += g / count + 1` is not aligned with the required conditions.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic is not correctly handling the conditions for counting valid pairs. It seems to be attempting to increment `ans` based on some arithmetic operations that do not correctly reflect the problem requirements.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks if they meet the specified condition, ensuring the correctness of the solution.
