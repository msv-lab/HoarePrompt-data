### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\)
  - \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n / count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += g / count + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**: `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are read from input.
2. **Count Initialization**: `count` starts at 2.
3. **Main Loop**: The loop runs from 2 to `m`.
   - **Count Calculation**: `countmins = count - 1`
   - **G Calculation**: `g = n / count`
   - **Break Condition**: If `g < countmins`, the loop breaks.
   - **Update Answer**: `ans += g / count + 1`
   - **Increment Count**: `count += 1`
4. **Output**: The final value of `ans` is printed.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to increment `ans` based on a simplified calculation (`g / count + 1`) which does not reflect the actual requirement of checking \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly identify valid pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
     - The program incorrectly counts some pairs and misses others.
     - For example, the pair \((2, 2)\) should be counted because \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\), but the program might miss it due to its flawed logic.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- This requires computing the greatest common divisor (gcd) for each pair, which the current program does not do.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It fails to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) and instead uses a simplified calculation that does not reflect the actual requirement.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
