Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: a list `a` of integers and an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is updated based on specific conditions. If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is determined by subtracting `a[i]` from `left[i]` and finding the appropriate index using `func_1(left, x)`, considering `last[i-1]`. If no valid `inx` is found or if `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains -1.**
