Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not properly handle cases where a slime cannot eat any of its neighbors due to being the smallest in its segment.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
2 2 3 1 1
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 1 -1 1 2
```
However, the provided function will incorrectly compute the result for the third slime (index 2) and the fifth slime (index 4). The function does not correctly handle the scenario where a slime is the smallest in its segment and thus cannot be eaten until a larger slime comes along to eat it. This is evident in the third and fifth slimes, where the function incorrectly computes the time as 2 instead of -1.

To fix this, the function needs to properly track the segments and ensure that slimes are only counted as being able to eat once a larger slime has come to eat them.
