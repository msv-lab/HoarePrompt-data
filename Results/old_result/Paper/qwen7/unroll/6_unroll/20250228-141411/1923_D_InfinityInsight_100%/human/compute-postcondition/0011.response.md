Output State: `left` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of all elements in `a` up to that point; `last` is a list where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the respective element in `a` before it changes; `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is updated based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` is set to `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is determined by subtracting `a[i]` from `left[i]` and finding the appropriate index using `func_1(left, x)` and considering `last[i-1]`. If no valid `inx` is found or if `inx` is less than 0, `ans[i]` remains -1.
