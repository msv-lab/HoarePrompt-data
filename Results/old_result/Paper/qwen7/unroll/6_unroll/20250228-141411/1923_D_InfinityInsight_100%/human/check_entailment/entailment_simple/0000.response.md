Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements a binary search-like approach to find the position of a value in a sorted list. It handles the edge case where the value is not present in the list by returning -1, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes three lists: `left`, `last`, and `ans`. `left` accumulates the sum of the slimes' sizes up to each index, `last` keeps track of the last occurrence of each unique slime size, and `ans` stores the result for each slime.
   - **Finding Last Occurrences**: The loop iterates through the list `a` to fill the `last` list with the index of the last occurrence of each unique slime size.
   - **Cumulative Sum Calculation**: Another loop calculates the cumulative sum of the sizes of the slimes up to each index and stores it in the `left` list.
   - **Eating Conditions**: For each slime, the function checks if it can eat its left neighbor (`a[i] < a[i - 1]`). If so, it sets the answer to 1. Otherwise, it calculates the potential time it would take to be eaten by finding the appropriate index in the `left` list and using the `func_1` function to find the exact position. The logic ensures that the slime is only considered to be eaten if it is strictly smaller than its neighbor and the cumulative sum condition is met.
   - **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles cases where a slime cannot be eaten by setting the answer to -1.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case by calling `func_2` twice (once forward and once backward) and then combining the results. This ensures that the smallest possible time for each slime to be eaten is calculated, considering both directions of eating.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, handling all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
