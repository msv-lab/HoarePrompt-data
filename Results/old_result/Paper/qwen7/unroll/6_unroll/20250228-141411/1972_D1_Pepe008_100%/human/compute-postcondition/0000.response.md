Output State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specified that `t` (which we now refer to as `T`) is an integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, this condition remains true after the code executes. All other variables (`n` and `m`) are not mentioned or affected by this line of code, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
