Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for n and m.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value for `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, the function evaluates `n` and `m` according to the given constraints and produces an output based on specific conditions related to these values.
