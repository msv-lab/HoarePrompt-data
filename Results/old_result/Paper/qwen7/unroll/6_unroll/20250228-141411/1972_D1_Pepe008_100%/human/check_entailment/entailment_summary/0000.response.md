Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given program against the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and initializes `suma` to 0.
   - It then iterates through values of `i` from 1 to `b` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `x` as \(\left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\).
   - If this value is greater than 0, it adds `x` to `suma`.
   - Additionally, if certain conditions involving `a`, `i`, and `i^2` are met, it increments `suma` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 2`.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The formula used in the program to calculate `x` and the conditions for incrementing `suma` do not directly relate to the problem constraints. Specifically, the problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is not being done in the current implementation.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem, it will produce incorrect results for most test cases.

Correctness: **False**
