Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic inside the function is flawed and does not accurately calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the inner loop and the calculations within it do not correctly implement the required logic.

The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the current implementation attempts to use a different approach that involves iterating over possible values of \(i\) and calculating sums based on these values, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown of why the current solution is incorrect:
- The loop `for i in range(1, b + 1):` does not correctly iterate through potential divisors or relevant values of \(i\).
- The calculation `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not relate directly to the problem's constraints.
- The conditions `if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:` do not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these issues, the program does not produce the correct results for the provided examples and test cases.

Correctness: **False**
