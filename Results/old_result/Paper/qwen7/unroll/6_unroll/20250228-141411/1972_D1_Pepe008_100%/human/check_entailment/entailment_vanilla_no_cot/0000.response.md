Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the conditions under which it should be incremented do not align with the problem statement. The problem requires checking whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the current implementation does not properly handle this condition.

Here's a more accurate approach to solve the problem:

1. Iterate through all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.
2. For each value of `b`, iterate through all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n`.
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

Let's rewrite the function accordingly:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This corrected version should accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
