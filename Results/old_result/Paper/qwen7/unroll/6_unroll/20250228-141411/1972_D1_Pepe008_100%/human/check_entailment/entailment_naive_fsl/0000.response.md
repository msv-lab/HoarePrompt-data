Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The formula used in the program seems to be incorrect and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, let's consider a simple test case:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\). However, the program outputs 3, which is incorrect because it does not account for the condition properly.

The program uses a formula that does not correctly handle the gcd condition and the multiple condition. A more accurate approach would involve iterating through all possible pairs and checking the conditions directly, rather than using a formula that seems to be misapplied.

Since the program does not work correctly for at least one input case, the correctness is **False**.
