Output State: **`xor` is 0, `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers representing a segment of the input array a, `bit` is an integer representing the current bit position being considered, and `x` is an integer representing the favorite number of Yarik; `new_arr` is an empty list, `thing1` is 0.**

The code initializes `thing1` to 0, which does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `xor`, `cur_arr`, `bit`, `x`, and `new_arr` remain unchanged.
