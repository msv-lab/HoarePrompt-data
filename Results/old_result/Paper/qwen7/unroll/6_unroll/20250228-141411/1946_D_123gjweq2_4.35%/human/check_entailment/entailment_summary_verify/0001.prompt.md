You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr, x):

    return find_max(arr, 31)

#Function 2:
def find_max(cur_arr, bit):
    if bit == -1:
        return len(cur_arr)
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    thing1 = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
    if xor >> bit & 1:
        thing1 = -1
    else:
        thing1 = find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)
    if x >> bit & 1:
        return max(find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1), len(new_arr))
    else:
        return thing1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `find_max` accepts two parameters: `cur_arr`, a list of non-negative integers, and `bit`, an integer representing the current bit position. It returns the length of the list `cur_arr` if the bit position is -1. Otherwise, it processes the list to find the maximum value based on the specified bit position and returns either -1, the length of a new processed list, or the maximum value found.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( k \) such that we can partition the array into \( k \) segments where the cumulative XOR of each segment does not exceed \( x \).
   - The segments must follow specific constraints: they must be contiguous, and the XOR of the elements within each segment combined with the previous segments' XORs must not exceed \( x \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The solution involves iterating over bits from the most significant to the least significant.
   - For each bit position, we try to form segments where the cumulative XOR up to that bit does not exceed \( x \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `find_max` with the entire array and the highest bit position (31 for 30-bit integers).
   - This is a reasonable approach as it initializes the recursive process.

4. **Function `find_max`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of the current array. This means we have processed all bits and the array can be fully segmented.
   - **Bit Processing**: For each bit position, it tries to form segments where the cumulative XOR up to that bit does not exceed \( x \).
   - **Recursive Calls**:
     - If the cumulative XOR up to the current bit is zero, it adds this XOR value to the list of new segments and recursively processes the remaining part of the array.
     - If the cumulative XOR up to the current bit is non-zero, it either includes this segment or continues without including it, depending on whether the current bit of \( x \) is set.

### Testing and Validation

To validate the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example Test Case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  3 1
  1 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Explanation**:
  - The segments could be `[1]` and `[2, 3]`.
  - XOR of `[1]` is `1`.
  - XOR of `[2, 3]` is `2 ^ 3 = 1`.
  - Combined XOR is `1 | 1 = 1`, which is within the limit `x = 1`.

#### Implementation Check:
- The function correctly handles the base case and recursively processes the array.
- It ensures that the cumulative XOR up to each bit does not exceed \( x \).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code and validating it against the provided example, the implementation appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
