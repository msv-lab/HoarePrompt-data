Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of `cur_arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `cur_arr`, it should start with the first element of `cur_arr` in the first iteration.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `cur_arr`. Therefore, `cur_arr` must contain at least one element for the loop to start executing.

4. **List the states that need to be adjusted**: Based on the above points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
   - `i` should be set to the first element of `cur_arr`.
   - `cur_arr` must contain at least one element.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `xor`, `bit`, `x`, `new_arr`, and `thing1` are not part of the loop head and do not affect whether the loop can start executing based on the given information.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is the first element of `cur_arr`, `cur_arr` must have at least one element**.
