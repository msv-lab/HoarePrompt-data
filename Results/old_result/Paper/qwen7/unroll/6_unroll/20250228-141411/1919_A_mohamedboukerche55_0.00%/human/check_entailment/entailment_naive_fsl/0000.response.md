Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program simply checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd and decides the winner based on that condition. However, the outcome of the game depends on the optimal strategy of both players, not just the parity of the total number of coins.

For example, consider the test case `1 1`. According to the problem description, if Alice chooses not to swap wallets, she will lose because her wallet will become empty, and Bob will then also choose not to swap, leading to Bob winning. However, the program incorrectly outputs "bob" for this case.

Similarly, for the test case `1 4`, the program should output "alice" based on the optimal play described in the example, but it outputs "bob" instead.

Thus, the program does not handle the game logic correctly and fails to determine the winner based on the optimal moves of both players.
