### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. Both players take turns, and the player who cannot make a valid move loses. Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the parity (even or odd nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner. If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

3. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It splits the string into two parts and converts them to integers.
   - It checks if the sum of these integers is even or odd and prints the corresponding winner.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of checking the parity of the sum is correct.
   - The program correctly handles the input and outputs the expected results based on the given examples.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in both wallets.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
