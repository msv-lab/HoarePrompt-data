Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1` Function**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but its implementation is flawed. It appends divisors in reverse order and then concatenates them, which is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results. However, more importantly, the logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed.

2. **Logic for Determining Valid `k` Values**: The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)` are even, and then uses the divisors of these values to determine possible `k`. However, the logic for checking if the divisors are valid `k` values is incorrect. The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is not sufficient to ensure that the divisor corresponds to a valid `k`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

- **Example Input**: `n = 76`, `x = 4`
- **Expected Output**: `9`

However, the program will not produce the correct result because the logic for determining valid `k` values is flawed. For instance, the program might incorrectly include or exclude certain divisors.

To fix the program, we need to correctly determine the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = 0
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        if (n + x - 2) % (2 * k - 2) == 0 and (n + x - 2) // (2 * k - 2) <= x:
            output += 1
    print(output)
```

This corrected version directly iterates over possible values of `k` and checks if they satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description.
