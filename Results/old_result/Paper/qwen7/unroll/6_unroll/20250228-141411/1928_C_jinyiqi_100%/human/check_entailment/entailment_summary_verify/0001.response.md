### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates all divisors of a given number `x` and returns them in ascending order.
   - The function is used to find possible values of `k` by checking conditions related to `x`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if `(n + x - 2)` is even. If it is, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the results.
   - Similarly, it checks if `(n - x)` is even. If it is, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the results.
   - For each divisor `s` obtained from `func_1`, it checks if `(s + 2)` is even and if `(s + 2) / 2` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - Valid divisors are added to the `output` list.
   - Finally, the program prints the length of the unique elements in the `output` list.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of a number `x` and returns them in ascending order.
   - This is used to find possible values of `k` by checking conditions related to `x`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `s + 2` is even, which implies `s` is even.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the value derived from `s` meets the requirement of the problem statement.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `t` and processing each one separately.
   - It uses sets to ensure uniqueness of the results before printing the count.

#### Edge Cases and Constraints:

- The constraints `1 <= t <= 100`, `1 <= x < n <= 10^9` are handled appropriately.
- The logic correctly identifies valid `k` values based on the given conditions.

#### Validation Using Function Summaries:

- The function `func_1` returns all divisors of `x` in ascending order.
- The main logic correctly filters these divisors based on the conditions `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summaries, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**

The program is correct.
