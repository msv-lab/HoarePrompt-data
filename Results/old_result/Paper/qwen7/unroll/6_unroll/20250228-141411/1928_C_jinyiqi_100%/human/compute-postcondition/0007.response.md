The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer. The function returns a list which is the concatenation of `output2` (a list of quotients) and `output1` (a list of divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, but in reverse order). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `x` and return a list combining the quotients and the reversed divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`.
