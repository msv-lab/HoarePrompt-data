Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input().strip())`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` is updated to hold the integer value entered by the user, stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation.
