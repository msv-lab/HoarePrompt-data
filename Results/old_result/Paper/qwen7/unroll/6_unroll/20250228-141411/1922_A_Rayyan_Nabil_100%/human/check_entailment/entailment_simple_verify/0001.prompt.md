You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, but string `c` does not. A template can consist of both lowercase and uppercase letters, where:
   - Lowercase letters in the template must exactly match the corresponding letters in `a` and `b`.
   - Uppercase letters in the template must not match the corresponding lowercase letters in `c`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if there is any position `i` where `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not equal `c[i]`. If such a position exists, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
   - This logic only checks if `a` and `b` can potentially match the template, but it does not ensure that `c` will not match the template.
   - It fails to consider the requirement that `c` should not match the template, which means `c[i]` should not match the lowercase version of the template character at position `i`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - However, `func_1` itself is incorrect because it does not check if `c` does not match the template.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - We need to create a template dynamically based on the characters of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - For each position `i`, if `a[i] == b[i]` and `a[i] != c[i]` (or `b[i] != c[i]`), we can set the template character to `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
   - If `a[i] != b[i]`, we cannot determine a valid template character without further information, so we return 'NO'.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution. They only check if `a` and `b` can match a template but do not ensure that `c` does not match it.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check the conditions for the template to ensure that `a` and `b` match while `c` does not.
