You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It constructs and returns a new list `ans` where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`. The last element of `ans` is the sum of the second last element and `arr[-1]`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2`
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4`
- `a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1`

The provided solution generates:
```
ans = [0] * n
ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
```

For the given input, the generated `ans` would be `[3, 5, 9, 10]`. However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
- `5 \bmod 3 = 2`, which is correct.
- `9 \bmod 5 = 4`, which is correct.
- `10 \bmod 9 = 1`, which is incorrect since `10 \bmod 9 = 1`, but we need `10 \bmod 9 = 1` to be true, which it is.

However, let's consider another example to definitively show the issue:
For the input:
```
3
1 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1`
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1`

The provided solution generates:
```
ans = [0] * n
ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
for i in range(n - 2):
    ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
    if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
        while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
            ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
```

For the given input, the generated `ans` would be `[2, 3, 4]`. However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
- `3 \bmod 2 = 1`, which is correct.
- `4 \bmod 3 = 1`, which is incorrect since `4 \bmod 3 = 1`, but we need `4 \bmod 3 = 1` to be true, which it is.

Thus, the program fails to generate a valid sequence for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
