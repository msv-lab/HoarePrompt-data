Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500), ans is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, each set to 0. The length of `ans` is `n`, while the length of `arr` remains `n-1`. Therefore, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, and `arr` retains its original state as a list of `n-1` integers.
