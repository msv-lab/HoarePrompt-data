Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers, `ans` is a list where the first element is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each subsequent element, it is the sum of `arr[i]` and the previous element in `ans` until it exceeds `arr[i]`; the last element of `ans` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the last element of the `ans` list by adding the last element of the `arr` list to the second last element of the `ans` list. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged according to the given rules.
