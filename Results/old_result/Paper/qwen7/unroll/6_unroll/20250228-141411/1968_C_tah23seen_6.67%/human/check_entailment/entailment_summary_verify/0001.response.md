### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires generating an array \(a\) such that for each \(x_i\), \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) holds true. The constraints and requirements are clear.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the size \(n\) and the array `arr` of length \(n-1\).
   - It calls a function `func_1` to generate the array `ans`.
   - The function `func_1` initializes `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - For each subsequent element, it tries to compute `ans[i+1]` such that `arr[i] = ans[i+1] \bmod ans[i]`. If the computed value is less than `arr[i]`, it increments `ans[i+1]` until it meets the condition.
   - Finally, it sets the last element `ans[-1]` to ensure the modulo condition is met with the previous element.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be trying to satisfy the modulo condition by incrementing the value of `ans[i+1]` until it meets the requirement. However, this approach may not always work as intended.
   - Consider the following example:
     - Input: `arr = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]`
     - The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
       - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 4\)
       - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 2\)
       - \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 5\)
       - \(a_5 \bmod a_4 = 1\)
       - \(a_6 \bmod a_5 = 2\)
     - The correct solution could be `a = [5, 9, 14, 16, 5, 11]`, but the provided code will generate a different sequence due to the way it increments `ans[i+1]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where `ans[i+1]` might need to be incremented multiple times to meet the condition. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results if the increments do not align with the required modulo conditions.
   - The constraints are within the bounds that the algorithm can handle efficiently, but the logic for generating `ans` is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution based on the problem description. The approach of incrementing `ans[i+1]` until it meets the condition is not sufficient to guarantee the correct modulo conditions for all possible inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
