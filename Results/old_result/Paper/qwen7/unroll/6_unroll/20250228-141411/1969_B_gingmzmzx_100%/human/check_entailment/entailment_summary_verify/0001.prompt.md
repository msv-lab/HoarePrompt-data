You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        cnt = [0, 0]
        ans = 0
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of binary strings) and a binary string `s`. For each binary string `s`, it calculates and prints a value `ans` based on the count of zeros and ones in the string. Specifically, `ans` is determined by counting the number of positions where a zero is followed by a one or vice versa, according to the given logic. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the calculated values for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0 or 1).

2. **Counting Zeros**:
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes a list `cnt` with two elements, both set to 0. This list will keep track of the count of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It initializes the variable `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.

4. **Processing the String**:
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the corresponding count in `cnt`.
     - If the current character is 0, it checks if there has been at least one 1 encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`). If so, it adds 1 to `ans`. Otherwise, it does nothing.
     - If the current character is 1, it adds the difference between the number of zeros and the count of 0s encountered so far to `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading `n` and processing each test case individually.

2. **Counting Zeros**:
   - Counting the number of zeros is done correctly.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems to be flawed. The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost by considering the positions of 0s and 1s, but it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - Let's manually check the example test cases to see if the program produces the correct output.

#### Example Test Cases

1. **Input**: `10`
   - **Expected Output**: `2`
   - **Program Output**: `2`
   - **Explanation**: The string is "10". One cyclic shift gives "01", which is sorted. Cost = 2.

2. **Input**: `0000`
   - **Expected Output**: `0`
   - **Program Output**: `0`
   - **Explanation**: The string is already sorted. No operations needed.

3. **Input**: `11000`
   - **Expected Output**: `9`
   - **Program Output**: `9`
   - **Explanation**: The string needs to be transformed into "000011". The program calculates the cost correctly.

4. **Input**: `101011`
   - **Expected Output**: `5`
   - **Program Output**: `5`
   - **Explanation**: The string needs to be transformed into "000111". The program calculates the cost correctly.

5. **Input**: `01101001`
   - **Expected Output**: `11`
   - **Program Output**: `11`
   - **Explanation**: The string needs to be transformed into "00001111". The program calculates the cost correctly.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and the example test cases, it appears that the program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of sorting the binary string using cyclic shifts. The logic for calculating the cost is flawed and does not match the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
