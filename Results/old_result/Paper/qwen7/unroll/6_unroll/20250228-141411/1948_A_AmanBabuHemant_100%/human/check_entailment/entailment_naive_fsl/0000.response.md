Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is odd correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is odd, the output should be 'NO'. However, the program prints 'YES' and a string when `n` is odd, which violates the problem description. For example, if `n = 5`, the program will generate a string like 'AABAA', which is incorrect since `n` is odd and the output should be 'NO'.
