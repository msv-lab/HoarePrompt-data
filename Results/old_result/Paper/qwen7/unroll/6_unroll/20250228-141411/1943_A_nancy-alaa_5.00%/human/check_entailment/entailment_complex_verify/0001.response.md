### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to her array `c`, then removes them from `a`.
   - Bob picks elements from `a` and removes them without appending.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to find the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c` at the end of the game, assuming both players play optimally.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - The loop iterates up to `n` times, checking for the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()` or has exactly one occurrence in `mpp`.

3. **Issues in the Provided Code:**
   - The code does not simulate the game correctly. It only checks for the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or has exactly one occurrence.
   - Alice and Bob's turns are not properly simulated. Alice should always try to maximize the MEX, and Bob should try to minimize it.
   - The logic for determining the MEX based on the optimal play of both players is missing.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice will always pick unique elements first to ensure they are not repeated in `c`.
   - Bob will remove elements that are already picked by Alice to prevent Alice from getting higher MEX values.
   - The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the smallest missing number is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob.

5. **Evaluation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code explains that the function processes each test case by reading `n` and `arr`, and then checks for the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or has exactly one occurrence.
   - This approach does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it consider the optimal strategy for both players.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly simulate the game or determine the optimal MEX value. It only checks for the smallest non-negative integer `i` that is not in `arr` or has exactly one occurrence, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX under optimal play conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not simulate the game correctly and does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.
