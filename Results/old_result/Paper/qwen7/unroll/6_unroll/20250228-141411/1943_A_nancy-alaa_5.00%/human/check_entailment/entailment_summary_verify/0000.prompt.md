You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        first = False
        for i in range(n):
            if i not in mpp.keys():
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1 and first:
                print(i)
                break
            if mpp[i] == 1:
                first = True



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then determines if there is any index \( i \) (where \( 0 \leq i < n \)) that does not appear in the list. If such an index exists, it prints the index. Otherwise, it checks for indices that appear exactly once in the list and prints the first one found after setting a flag. If neither condition is met for a test case, no output is generated for that case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the concept of MEX. Here's why:

1. **Game Rules**: According to the problem description, Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array `a`. Alice appends the chosen element to her array `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob only removes the chosen element from `a`. However, the program does not simulate these turns correctly. It simply checks the presence of each index in the counter and prints the first missing index without considering the turns.

2. **Optimal Play**: The program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The provided solution does not simulate the strategic choices that both players would make during their turns.

3. **Example Case**: Consider the following test case:
   ```
   1
   4
   0 0 1 1
   ```
   - The correct game sequence should be:
     1. Alice picks 0, `a` becomes [0, 1], `c` becomes [0].
     2. Bob picks 0, `a` becomes [1], `c` remains [0].
     3. Alice picks 1, `a` becomes [], `c` becomes [0, 1].
     - The MEX of [0, 1] is 2.
   - However, the provided program will incorrectly print 0 or 1 based on the first missing index, not considering the optimal play.

Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game and cannot produce the correct MEX value for all inputs.
