Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `p`.
3. It initializes a list `v` of length `n+1` with the first element as 0 and the rest as the elements from the input list `p`.
4. The logic checks if there exists any friend `i` such that `v[v[i]] == i`. This condition means that the i-th friend and their best friend's best friend are the same person, indicating a pair of mutual best friends.
5. If such a pair is found, the program prints `2` because inviting both friends in this pair will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
6. If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`, which is not necessarily correct according to the problem statement. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations to ensure at least 2 friends come, and in some cases, fewer than 3 invitations might be sufficient.

Given the example in the execution summary and the problem statement, the program should find a way to minimize the number of invitations. However, the current implementation only checks for the existence of a mutual best friend pair and does not explore other possible configurations that might require fewer than 3 invitations.

Therefore, the program is not fully correct based on the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
