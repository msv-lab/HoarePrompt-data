Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) and strings `s` (consisting of lowercase Latin letters with a total length not exceeding 10^6). The function does not return any value but processes each test case according to the given constraints.**
