Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program counts occurrences of "map" and "pie" but does not account for overlapping substrings or the order in which they appear. For example, in the input "mapie", the program would count both "map" and "pie", resulting in a deletion count of 2, but only one character needs to be removed ("e") to make the string beautiful. The program also does not handle the case where "map" and "pie" overlap, such as in the string "mappie", where the program would incorrectly suggest removing two characters instead of one.
