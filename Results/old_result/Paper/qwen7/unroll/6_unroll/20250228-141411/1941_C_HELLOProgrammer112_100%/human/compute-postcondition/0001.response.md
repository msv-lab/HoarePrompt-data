Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the expression `x + y - z` for each test case, where `x` is the number of occurrences of the substring "map", `y` is the number of occurrences of the substring "pie", and `z` is the number of occurrences of the substring "mapie". Each integer corresponds to the output of the `print` statement for one test case.
