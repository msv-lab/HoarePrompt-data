Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `k` (where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12). The function returns a value based on the input parameters.**

This means the function takes an integer `t` within the range of 1 to 100, another integer `n` within the range of 1 to 200,000, an integer `k` within the range of 0 to 1,000,000,000,000, and a list `a` containing `n` integers, each of which is between 1 and 1,000,000,000,000. Based on these inputs, the function calculates and returns a specific value.
