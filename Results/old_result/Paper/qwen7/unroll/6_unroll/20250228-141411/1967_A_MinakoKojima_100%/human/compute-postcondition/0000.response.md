Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans_list`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
