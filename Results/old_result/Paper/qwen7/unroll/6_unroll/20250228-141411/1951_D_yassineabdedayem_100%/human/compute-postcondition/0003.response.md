Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration of the loop, based on the values of `n` and `k`:
- If `n` equals `k`, the output will be 'YES', followed by 1 and 1.
- If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, the output will be 'YES', followed by 2, then `n - k + 1`, and finally 1.
- Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

The exact output depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each iteration, but it will consist of lines starting with 'YES' or 'NO', followed by either 1, 1 or 2, `n - k + 1`, and 1 (if applicable).
