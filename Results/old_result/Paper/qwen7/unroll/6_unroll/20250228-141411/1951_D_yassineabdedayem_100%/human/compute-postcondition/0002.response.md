Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to an iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `n` equals `k`, it will print 'YES', followed by 1 and 1. If `n + 2` is greater than `k * 2`, it will print 'YES', followed by 2, then `n - k + 1` and 1. Otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The total number of iterations is determined by the value of `t`. Each line's content depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` for that iteration.
