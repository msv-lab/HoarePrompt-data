Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in each string and prints the character that appears most frequently. Given the constraints and the problem description, the program handles all possible cases correctly. For each test case, it iterates through the string and increments counters for 'A' and 'B'. After counting, it compares the two counters and prints the appropriate character. Since the program works for all the examples provided and the logic seems sound for the given constraints, it is correct.
