Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of an array after performing \(k\) operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The operations can be performed on any subarray, possibly empty, and the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The optimal strategy often involves inserting the sum of the entire array multiple times.
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the largest subarray with a non-negative sum, which is crucial for determining the initial sum before applying the operations.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the remainder of the number when divided by \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - `func_2` calculates the largest subarray with a non-negative sum and returns its range.
   - The calculation of the answer in the main loop uses the result from `func_2` to compute the maximum possible sum after \(k\) operations.
   - `func_1` correctly handles the modulo operation.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to correctly identify the largest subarray with a non-negative sum.
   - The main logic in the annotated program correctly applies the operations and handles the modulo operation.
   - There are no apparent logical errors or incorrect assumptions in the code.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.
