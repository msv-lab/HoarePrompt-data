### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simply returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used in the final step to ensure the result fits within the required modulo constraint. This part is correct and necessary.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - The purpose of `func_2` is to find the maximum sum subarray. However, the function summary indicates that `func_2` does not handle the insertion of the sum of the subarray multiple times as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it only finds the maximum sum subarray once. This is a significant oversight since the problem requires inserting the sum of a subarray up to \(k\) times.

3. **Function `func_3`:**
   - The function `func_3` is indeed incomplete and does not provide any logic to solve the main problem. It initializes `answer` to 0 but does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array. This function is not used in the provided code, which suggests that the main logic is missing.

Given these observations, the current implementation is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. The core issue lies in the lack of logic to handle the insertion of the sum of subarrays multiple times as specified in the problem statement. The function `func_2` only finds the maximum sum subarray once, which is insufficient to achieve the desired result.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to handle the insertion of the sum of subarrays multiple times, as required by the problem statement.
