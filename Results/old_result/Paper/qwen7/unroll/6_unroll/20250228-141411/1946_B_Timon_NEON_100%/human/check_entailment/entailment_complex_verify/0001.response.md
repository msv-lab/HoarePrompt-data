### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - Inserting the sum of a subarray multiple times can increase the overall sum significantly.
   - The optimal strategy often involves using the largest positive subarrays and possibly the entire array if it has a large positive sum.
   - The modulo operation ensures the result fits within a specific range.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - `func_1(number)`: This function correctly returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
   - `func_2(arr)`: This function aims to find the maximum sum subarray. However, it has several issues:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` incorrectly.
     - It does not handle negative sums properly; it should only consider positive sums when extending the current segment.
     - It appends segments with indices but does not calculate their actual sums.
     - It does not account for the possibility of inserting the entire array's sum multiple times.
   - `func_3(number, quantity)`: This function is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the sum of the entire array.
   - If the sum of the array is positive, adding the sum multiple times can maximize the result.
   - If the sum is negative, consider the largest positive subarray and possibly the entire array if it helps.

5. **Evaluation of the Given Code**:
   - The `func_2` function is designed to find the largest subarray with a non-negative sum. However, it does not correctly identify and sum these subarrays. Instead, it appends segments with indices without calculating their sums.
   - The main logic in the program is flawed because it uses the result of `func_2` incorrectly. Specifically, it multiplies the sum of the largest subarray by \(2^k\) and subtracts the sum of the largest subarray again, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.
   - The `func_3` function is completely unused and does not contribute to solving the problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly solve the problem due to logical errors and incompleteness.
   - The program does not correctly identify the largest subarray with a non-negative sum and does not handle the insertion of the entire array's sum multiple times.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
