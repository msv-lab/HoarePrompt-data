Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `len(arr)`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. This means that `i` should be 0 initially, and `len(arr)` should be at least 1 (since if `len(arr)` is 0, the loop won't execute).

3. **Consider the initial state**: 
   - `max_sum` is -1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.
   - `new_segment` is an empty list.
   - `max_segment` is [0, 0].
   - `segments_variants` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` should be set to 0.
   - `len(arr)` should be at least 1 to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `len(arr)`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `len(arr)` must be at least 1**
