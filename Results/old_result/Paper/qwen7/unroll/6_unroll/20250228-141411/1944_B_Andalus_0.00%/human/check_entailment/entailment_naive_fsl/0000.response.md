Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the XOR of the elements in `r`. Here's a counterexample to illustrate this:

Consider the input:
```
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

The program attempts to create two arrays `l` and `r` each of length 4 (since \(2k = 2 \times 2 = 4\)). However, the logic used to construct `l` and `r` does not guarantee that their XOR values will be equal. For instance, the program might select elements from `lft` and `rgt` without ensuring that the XOR condition is met.

A correct approach would involve more sophisticated logic to ensure that the XOR of the selected elements in `l` matches the XOR of the selected elements in `r`. The current implementation does not account for this requirement, leading to incorrect outputs in certain cases.
