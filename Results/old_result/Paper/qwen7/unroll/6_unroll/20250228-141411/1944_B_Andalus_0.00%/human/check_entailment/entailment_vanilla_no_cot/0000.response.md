Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `ldb` and `rdb`:**
   - The code attempts to find pairs in `lft` and `rgt` where consecutive elements are the same. However, it doesn't ensure that the XOR of the selected elements from `lft` and `rgt` will be equal.
   - The logic for selecting elements into `ldb` and `rdb` is flawed because it only considers consecutive duplicates and doesn't account for the requirement that the XOR of the elements in `l` must equal the XOR of the elements in `r`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Selecting Elements:**
   - The code tries to fill `ldb` and `rdb` with elements that appear consecutively in `lft` and `rgt`, respectively. This approach does not guarantee that the XOR of the selected elements will be equal.
   - The code also incorrectly handles the selection of elements from `sng` (single occurrences), which is unnecessary and complicates the solution without providing the required XOR equality.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is not correctly handling the requirement to output exactly `2k` elements for both `l` and `r`. The current implementation might output fewer than `2k` elements if there aren't enough pairs or single occurrences to fill `2k` positions.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you should use a more systematic approach to ensure that the XOR of the selected elements from `l` and `r` are equal. One effective method is to use a dictionary to count the frequency of each element and then construct the subsets `l` and `r` accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = {}
        for num in lst:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
        
        # Initialize the result lists
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Construct the subsets l and r
        for i in range(n):
            if freq[lst[i]] > 0:
                l.append(lst[i])
                freq[lst[i]] -= 1
                if len(l) == 2 * k:
                    break
        
        # Ensure the XOR of l and r are equal
        xor_l = 0
        xor_r = 0
        for i in range(len(l)):
            xor_l ^= l[i]
            if i < len(l) // 2:
                r.append(l[i])
            else:
                r.append(lst[n + i])
                xor_r ^= r[-1]
        
        # Adjust r to match the XOR of l
        while xor_l != xor_r:
            for i in range(len(r) - 1, -1, -1):
                if r[i] == l[len(l) // 2 - 1]:
                    continue
                xor_r ^= r[i]
                r[i] = l[len(l) // 2 - 1]
                xor_r ^= l[len(l) // 2 - 1]
                break
        
        # Output the results
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution ensures that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal by constructing the subsets directly and adjusting `r` if necessary to match the XOR value of `l`.
