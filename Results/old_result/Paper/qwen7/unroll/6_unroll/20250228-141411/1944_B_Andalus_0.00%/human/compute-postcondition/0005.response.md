Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( T \), and for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \), and an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \). It sorts the array into left and right halves, identifies repeated and unique elements in the left half, and prints pairs of repeated elements and unique elements from the left half, followed by unique elements from both halves, ensuring no more than \( k \) elements are printed per line. The same process is applied to the right half of the array.**
