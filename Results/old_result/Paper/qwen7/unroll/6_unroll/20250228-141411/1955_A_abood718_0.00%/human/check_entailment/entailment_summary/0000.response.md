Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`.
3. It checks the condition `if B * 2 < C` to determine if buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper than buying them individually.
4. If the condition is true, it prints `A * B`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts at the individual price.
5. If the condition is false, it further checks if `A` is even using `if A % 2 == 0`. If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
6. If `A` is odd, it calculates `X = A // 2` and prints `X * C + B`, which represents buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the individual price.
7. The logic for handling odd numbers of yogurts ensures that the minimum cost is achieved by maximizing the use of the promotion.

Given this analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
