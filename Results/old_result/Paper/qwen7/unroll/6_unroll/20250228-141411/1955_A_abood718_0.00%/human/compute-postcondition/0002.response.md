Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either the value of `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X` followed by `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer `t`. Each line's content depends on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case, following the conditions given in the loop body.
