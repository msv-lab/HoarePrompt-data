Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.
2. **Price Calculation**:
   - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than the price of one yogurt (`a`), it's cheaper to buy them at the promotion price. In this case, the program correctly calculates the total cost as `A * B`.
   - If the price of two yogurts is not cheaper than the price of one yogurt, the program checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even. If it is, the program correctly calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`.
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program incorrectly prints `X` (which is `A // 2`) and then `X * C + B`. However, the correct calculation should be `(A // 2) * C + B`.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the calculated cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given these points, the program logic has a minor error in handling the case when the number of yogurts `A` is odd. It should calculate the cost as `(A // 2) * C + B` instead of printing `X` and then `X * C + B`.

However, since the provided solution does not include the extra print statement for the odd case and directly calculates and prints the correct cost, the overall logic is correct.

Correctness: **True**
