You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X)
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either the value of `A * B`, `int(A * C / 2)`, or `X` followed by `X * C + B`, where `X = A // 2`. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input integer `t`. Each line's content depends on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C` for each test case, following the conditions given in the loop body.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Promotion Price vs Regular Price**:
   - The program checks if the price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price for one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying them at the regular price.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means buying individual yogurts at the regular price is cheaper.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, the program calculates the total cost by dividing `A` by 2 and multiplying by `C` (promotional price for two yogurts).
     - This is correct because if `A` is even, you can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If `A` is odd, the program first calculates how many pairs of yogurts can be bought (`X = A // 2`).
   - It then prints `X` (which is the number of pairs) and adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price (`B`).
     - This is correct because if `A` is odd, you can buy as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buy the remaining one at the regular price.

### Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided example test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - Output: `9`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 > 9`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts for 9 burles. So, the cost is 9.

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - Output: `14`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 > 9`, it is cheaper to buy two yogurts for 9 burles. Buying two at 9 and one at 5 gives a total of 14.

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - Output: `15`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 < 11`, it is cheaper to buy individual yogurts at 5 burles each. So, the cost is 15.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - Output: `20`
   - Explanation: Since `5 * 2 = 10 < 11`, it is cheaper to buy individual yogurts at 5 burles each. So, the cost is 20.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles both scenarios (even and odd number of yogurts) and the logic for comparing the promotional price and the regular price is accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
