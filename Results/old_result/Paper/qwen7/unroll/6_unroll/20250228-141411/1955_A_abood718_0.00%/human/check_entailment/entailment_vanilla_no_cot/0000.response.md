Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Odd Number of Yogurts**: The logic for handling an odd number of yogurts is flawed. Specifically, the code prints `X` and `X * C + B` separately without combining them into the final result.

2. **Redundant Print Statements**: The line `print(X)` is unnecessary and should be removed.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The logic does not handle all edge cases properly, especially when the promotion price for two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the regular price (`2B`).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            # If the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying two at regular price
            total_cost = (A // 2) * C + max(A % 2, 0) * B
        else:
            # Otherwise, just buy all yogurts at the regular price
            total_cost = A * B
        print(total_cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for both even and odd numbers of yogurts, and handles the promotion price appropriately.
