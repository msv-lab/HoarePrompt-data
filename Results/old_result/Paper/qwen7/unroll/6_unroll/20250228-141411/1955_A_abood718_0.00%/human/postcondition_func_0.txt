The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers A, B, and C. For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible values based on specific conditions: A * B, int(A * C / 2), or X followed by X * C + B, where X is defined as A // 2. The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, then iterates through each test case, performing the necessary calculations and printing the results.
