Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Promotion Price Comparison:**
   - The program checks if the price of two yogurts (`C`) is less than twice the price of one yogurt (`B * 2`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
       - In this case, the program prints `A * B`, which is the total cost if each yogurt is bought at the individual price.
     - If `B * 2 >= C`, it means it's cheaper to buy yogurts in pairs.
       - The program then checks if the number of yogurts `A` is even.
         - If `A` is even, it prints `int(A * C / 2)`, which is the total cost if all yogurts are bought in pairs.
         - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost by:
           - Buying `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (`X * C`), where `X = A // 2`.
           - Buying the remaining one yogurt at the individual price (`B`).

3. **Edge Cases and Logic:**
   - The logic for handling odd numbers of yogurts is correct. It buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt(s) individually.
   - The division `A * C / 2` is correctly converted to an integer using `int()` to get the floor value.

### Testing the Logic with Examples:

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input: `2 5 9`
   - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - Since `B * 2 = 10 > 9`, it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - `A` is even, so the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
   - Output: `9`

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input: `3 5 9`
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
   - Since `B * 2 = 10 > 9`, it's cheaper to buy in pairs.
   - `A` is odd, so the cost is `int(3 // 2 * 9) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 15 - 1 = 14`.
   - Output: `14`

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input: `3 5 11`
   - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - Since `B * 2 = 10 < 11`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - The cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
   - Output: `15`

4. **Test Case 4:**
   - Input: `4 5 11`
   - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
   - Since `B * 2 = 10 < 11`, it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually.
   - The cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
   - Output: `20`

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
