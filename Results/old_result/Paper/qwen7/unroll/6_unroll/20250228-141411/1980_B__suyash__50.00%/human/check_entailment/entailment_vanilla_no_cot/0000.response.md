Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the entire line `a` as a single string, which is not necessary. It should directly read the values for `n`, `f`, and `k`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Favorite Cube Index**: The program uses `o = input().split()` to split the string `a`, but it should use `b[2:]` to get the list of values for the cubes.

3. **Sorting and Counting Logic**: The logic for counting occurrences of each value and then sorting them is unnecessary and complicates the solution. We can directly sort the list of values and check the position of the favorite cube.

4. **Logic for Determining Removal**: The logic for determining whether the favorite cube will be removed is flawed. It does not correctly handle all edge cases, especially when multiple cubes have the same value.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the cubes in non-increasing order
        sorted_cubes = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        # Find the position of the favorite cube after sorting
        fav_index = sorted_cubes.index(a[f-1])
        
        # Check if the favorite cube is among the first k cubes
        if fav_index < k:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly handles the input, sorts the cubes, finds the position of the favorite cube, and checks if it is among the first `k` cubes.
