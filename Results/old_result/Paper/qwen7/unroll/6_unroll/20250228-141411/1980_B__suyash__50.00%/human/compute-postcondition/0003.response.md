Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program checks if a certain condition is met and prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the logic within the loop. After all iterations, the final printed statement from the last executed iteration is the output state.
