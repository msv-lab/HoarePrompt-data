Functionality: **The function processes a series of throws for a ball game involving multiple players. It starts with an initial player holding the ball and receives instructions for each throw from `func_1()`. These instructions specify the distance and direction of the throw. The function updates the set of players holding the ball based on these instructions, performing arithmetic operations modulo the total number of players. If the number 0 is in the set after processing all throws, it is replaced with the total number of players. Finally, the function prints the size of the set and its elements, sorted in ascending order.**
