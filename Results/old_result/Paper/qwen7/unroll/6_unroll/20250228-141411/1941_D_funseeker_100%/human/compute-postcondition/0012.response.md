Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs from func_1() and func_3(). It processes the distance and direction for each throw provided by func_1() and uses the initial player and number of players and throws from func_3() to determine the final position of the ball.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but works with data indirectly provided by other functions, processing the details of throws and determining the final player with the ball based on the initial conditions and throw details.
