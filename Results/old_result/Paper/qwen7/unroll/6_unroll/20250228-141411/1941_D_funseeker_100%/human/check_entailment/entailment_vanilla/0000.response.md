### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` functions.
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - The program uses a set to store all possible positions of the ball after each throw. This ensures that all possible positions are considered.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if the position `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it replaces `0` with `n` to handle the circular nature of the players.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their sorted positions.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It handles both clockwise and counterclockwise directions appropriately and ensures that all possible positions are considered.

### Correctness:
**True**
