Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a set of integers.
- Each integer in `ans` is the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`.
- If `0` was initially in `ans`, it has been removed and `n` has been added to `ans`.
- If `0` was not initially in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

When the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement is executed, it will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.

Given the transformation rules, the elements of `ans` could be any integers resulting from the described operations, but the exact values depend on the initial set and the values of `r` and `n`. Since these values are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numbers in `ans`.

However, the key point is that the output will be the sorted elements of the transformed set `ans`.

Output: **the sorted elements of the set ans (where each element is the result of adding or subtracting r to or from each element in ans modulo n, and if 0 was initially in ans, it has been removed and n has been added to ans)**
