You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of players (2 <= n <= 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 <= m <= 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 <= x <= n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c for each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `ans` is a set of integers, each integer being the result of adding or subtracting `r` (where `r` is an integer derived from the loop) to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`. The operations are determined by the value of `c` ('0' or '1'), and `c` is derived from the string returned by `func_1()` split by space.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: Postcondition: `ans` is a set of integers, each integer being the result of adding or subtracting `r` to or from each element in `ans` modulo `n`. If `0` was initially in `ans`, it has been removed and `n` has been added to `ans`. If `0` was not initially in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans)
    print(*sorted(ans))
    #This is printed: the sorted elements of the set ans (where each element is the result of adding or subtracting r to or from each element in ans modulo n, and if 0 was initially in ans, it has been removed and n has been added to ans)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but relies on the outputs from func_1() and func_3(). It processes the distance and direction for each throw provided by func_1() and uses the initial player and number of players and throws from func_3() to determine the final position of the ball.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
