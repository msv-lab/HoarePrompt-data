Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating a ball game where players pass the ball to each other in a circle. The goal is to determine which players could have the ball after a series of throws, given the distances and some unknown directions of the throws.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - **func_2()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - **func_3()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - **func_4()**: 
     - Reads the initial number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.
     - Initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
     - Iterates over each throw, reading the distance `r` and direction `c`.
     - Updates the set `ans` based on whether the throw is clockwise (`0` or `?`) or counterclockwise (`1` or `?`).
     - Adjusts the set if the number `0` is present and replaces it with `n`.
     - Prints the number of players and their indices in sorted order.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly initializes the set with the starting player.
   - It processes each throw, updating the set of possible players holding the ball based on the distance and direction.
   - The handling of `0` replacing `n` ensures that the circular nature of the game is preserved.
   - The final output is sorted and formatted correctly.

Given the execution summaries and the logical flow within `func_4()`, the implementation appears to correctly simulate the ball game and determine the possible players holding the ball after all throws.

Correctness: **True**
