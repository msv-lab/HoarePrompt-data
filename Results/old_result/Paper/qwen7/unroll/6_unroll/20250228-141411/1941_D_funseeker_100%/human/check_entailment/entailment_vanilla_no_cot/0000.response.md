Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after \(m\) throws. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input values correctly using custom functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` to handle reading a line, an integer, and space-separated integers respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include the possible positions of the ball based on whether the throw was clockwise (`0`), counterclockwise (`1`), or could be either (`?`). This is done by adding both the clockwise and counterclockwise positions to the set.

4. **Adjusting for Zero Indexing**: If the final position is `0`, it adjusts it to `n` to ensure the position is within the valid range.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their sorted list of positions.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program accurately computes the possible players who could have the ball after the specified throws. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
