Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input as specified, processes each throw, and calculates the possible players who could have the ball after all the throws. The program uses sets to efficiently manage the possible positions of the ball and handles the different directions ('0', '1', '?') appropriately. The use of `lru_cache` is not necessary in this context, but the rest of the logic aligns well with the problem requirements. Since the program processes each throw and updates the possible positions correctly, and handles all the specified cases without errors, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
