### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` functions.
   - It reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the initial player `x`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the initial player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by adding `r` to the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it calculates the new position by subtracting `r` from the current position and taking modulo `n`.
   - The program uses a set to store all possible positions of the ball after each throw. This ensures that all possible positions are considered.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if the position `0` is in the set `ans`. If so, it replaces `0` with `n` to handle the circular nature of the players.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique players who could have the ball and their sorted positions.

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
  - State: The program reads a line from standard input, strips any trailing whitespace, and returns it.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - Calls `func_1()` and returns the integer value.
  - State: The program returns an integer value based on the test case values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `x`, `r_i`, and `c_i`.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`):**
  - Calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers obtained by converting the strings from the output of `func_1()` split operation into integers.
  - State: The program processes the output of `func_1()` and returns a list of integers.

- **Function 4 (`func_4`):**
  - Initializes `ans` with the initial player `x`.
  - Iterates over each throw, updating `ans` based on the direction `c` and distance `r`.
  - Handles the edge case where `0` is in `ans` by replacing it with `n`.
  - Prints the number of unique players and their sorted positions.

### Validation:

- **Input Reading:**
  - The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The use of sets to track possible positions is correct. Sets ensure that only unique positions are stored.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation ensures that the positions wrap around correctly when they exceed the number of players.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - Replacing `0` with `n` handles the circular nature of the players correctly.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the number of unique players and their sorted positions.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. It handles both clockwise and counterclockwise directions appropriately and ensures that all possible positions are considered. The edge case handling is also correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
