Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and t is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 is still valid, but now it also specifies that `t` is the integer input received from the user. The other information about `n` and the cells containing chips remains unchanged as the code does not affect those variables.
