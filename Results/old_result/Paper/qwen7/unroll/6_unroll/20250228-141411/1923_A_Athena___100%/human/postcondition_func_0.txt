The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of cases, an integer `n` indicating the number of cells, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) indicating the presence of chips in the cells. It removes any leading and trailing zeros from the list and counts the remaining zeros. The function prints the count of zeros for each test case.
