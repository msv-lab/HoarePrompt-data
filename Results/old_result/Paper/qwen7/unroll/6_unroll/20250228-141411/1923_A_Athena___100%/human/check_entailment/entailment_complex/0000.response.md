Reasoning:
The provided function does not correctly solve the problem. The function removes leading and trailing zeros from the list `a`, which represents the positions of the chips and free cells, but it does not account for moving the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them. Instead, it simply counts the number of zeros (free cells) after removing the leading and trailing zeros, which is not the correct approach.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are in a single block. The function should keep track of the minimum number of moves required to achieve this configuration.

Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:
- It removes leading and trailing zeros, which does not necessarily result in the minimum number of moves.
- It does not simulate the actual movement of chips to the closest free cell to the left.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
