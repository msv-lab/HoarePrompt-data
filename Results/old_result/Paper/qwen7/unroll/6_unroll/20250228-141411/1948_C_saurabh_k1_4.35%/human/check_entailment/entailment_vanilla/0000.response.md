Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` (number of columns).
   - It then reads two strings representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks the condition `b[n - 2] == '<'`.
   - If this condition is true, it prints 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

### Problem Understanding

- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and must reach `(2, n)`.
- The robot can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- The robot then moves according to the arrow in the current cell.
- The goal is to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Condition**:
   - The condition `b[n - 2] == '<'` only checks the arrow in the second-to-last column of the second row.
   - This condition does not account for the entire path the robot needs to take to reach `(2, n)`.
   - The robot can move in various ways, and the arrow in the second-to-last column might not be the determining factor.

2. **Lack of Path Tracing**:
   - The program does not trace the path the robot takes to determine if it can reach `(2, n)`.
   - It only checks one specific condition, which is insufficient to solve the problem.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle other scenarios where the robot can still reach `(2, n)` despite the arrow in the second-to-last column being `'< '`.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)` based on the provided conditions and path tracing logic.

### Correctness

Correctness: **False**
