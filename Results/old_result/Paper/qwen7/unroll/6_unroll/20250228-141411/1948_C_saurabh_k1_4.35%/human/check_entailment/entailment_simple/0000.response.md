Reasoning:
1. The program iterates over each test case using a loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the two strings representing the rows of the grid.
3. It checks if the second last character (`b[n-2]`) of the second row string is `<`. If it is, the program prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
4. However, this logic is flawed because the robot's movement is determined by both the current position and the direction of the arrow in the current cell. The program does not account for the robot's actual path through the grid.
5. The program fails to consider the robot's movement pattern, which should follow the arrows in the grid, not just check the last few characters of the second row.
6. The provided examples show that the program gives incorrect results, such as in the third example where the output is 'NO' but the correct answer should be 'YES'.

Correctness: **False**
