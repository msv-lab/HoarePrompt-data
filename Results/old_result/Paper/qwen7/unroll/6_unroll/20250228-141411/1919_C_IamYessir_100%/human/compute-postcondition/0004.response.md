Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then divides the list into two sublists \( a \) and \( b \) based on certain conditions. After processing all test cases, it counts the number of increasing subsequences in both sublists combined and prints the total count.**
