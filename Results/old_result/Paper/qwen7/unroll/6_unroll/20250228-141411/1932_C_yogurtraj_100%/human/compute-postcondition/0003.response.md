Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case within `t`, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4, an array `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. Based on these inputs, the function processes each test case and returns a result for each.**

Note: The actual processing and return value details were not provided in the problem statement, so the functionality description focuses on the input parameters.
