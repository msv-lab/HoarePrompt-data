Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4. The array a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4 for all i. The string s is a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. After executing the loop, the variable y is a list of n integers where each element y[i] (0 ≤ i < n) is calculated based on the operations inside the loop, starting from the last element and moving backwards. The value of y[0] is determined by the final value of k after the loop completes, and each subsequent y[i] depends on the direction ('L' or 'R') specified in the string s at position i.
