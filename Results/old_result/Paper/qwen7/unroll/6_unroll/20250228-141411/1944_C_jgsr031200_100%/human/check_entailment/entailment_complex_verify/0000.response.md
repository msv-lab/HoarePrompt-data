### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
- Alice starts by appending an element from `a` to her array `c` and deleting it from `a`.
- Bob then picks an element from `a` and deletes it.
- The game continues until `a` is empty.
- The goal is to find the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, with Alice trying to maximize it and Bob trying to minimize it.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Initializes a frequency array `freq` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - Iterates through `freq` to find the first element that appears exactly once or does not appear at all.
   - Prints this element and breaks the loop.

2. **Key Issues**:
   - The function does not simulate the game process where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - It simply finds the first element that meets the condition based on the frequency, without considering the sequence of moves.
   - This approach does not account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob during the game.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
2
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**First Test Case:**
- Initial `arr`: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- Alice picks `1`, so `a = [0, 0, 1]` and `c = [1]`.
- Bob picks `0`, so `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [1]`.
- Alice picks `0`, so `a = [1]` and `c = [1, 0]`.
- Bob picks `1`, so `a = []` and `c = [1, 0]`.
- MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`.

**Second Test Case:**
- Initial `arr`: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- Alice picks `0`, so `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
- Bob picks `1`, so `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
- Alice picks `2`, so `a = [3]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
- Bob picks `3`, so `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.
- MEX of `[0, 2]` is `1`.

The program outputs:
```
0
1
```

These outputs are incorrect because the program does not simulate the game process. Instead, it just checks the frequency of elements, which does not reflect the optimal strategy.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly simulate the game process and therefore cannot produce the correct MEX values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
