Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to determine the game's final score.
   - It initializes a frequency array `freq` of size `n + 1` to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through `arr` and updates the frequency array.
   - It then iterates through the frequency array to determine the MEX value:
     - If any element appears exactly once (`freq[i] == 1`), it increments the counter `cou`.
     - If `cou` reaches 2 or if any element does not appear at all (`freq[i] == 0`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.

### Correctness Check

#### Problem Understanding:
- Alice and Bob play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of the array `c`, respectively.
- Alice can pick elements from `a` and append them to `c`, while Bob can only delete elements from `a`.
- The final MEX of `c` depends on how the elements are picked and deleted.

#### Function Logic:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's turns. Instead, it simply counts the frequency of elements and determines the MEX based on those counts.
- This approach does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the optimal strategy is followed.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the example test case:
```
4
0 0 1 1
```

- Alice will pick an element from `a` and append it to `c`. Since Alice goes first, she can pick either `0` or `1`.
- If Alice picks `0`, then `c = [0]` and `a = [0, 1]`.
- Bob will then pick an element from `a` and delete it. He can pick either `0` or `1`.
- If Bob picks `0`, then `c = [0]` and `a = [1]`.
- Alice will then pick `1` and append it to `c`, making `c = [0, 1]`.
- The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

The given function does not simulate these steps and instead just counts frequencies, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
