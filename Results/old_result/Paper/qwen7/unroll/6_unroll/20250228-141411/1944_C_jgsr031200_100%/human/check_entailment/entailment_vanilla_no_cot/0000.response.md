Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Instead, it simply counts the frequency of elements in the array and prints the first element that appears exactly once or twice, which is not related to the optimal strategy for the game.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and ensure that the final MEX of the array `c` is calculated based on their optimal strategies. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's turns**: Alice can always pick an element that will help her maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to minimize it.
2. **Maintain the count of elements picked by Alice and Bob**: Use two separate counters to keep track of the elements picked by Alice and Bob.
3. **Calculate the MEX at the end**: After all elements are picked, calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    alice_picked = set()
    bob_picked = set()
    
    # Alice picks elements first
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            alice_picked.add(arr[i])
        else:  # Bob's turn
            bob_picked.add(arr[i])
    
    # Calculate the MEX
    mex = 0
    while mex in alice_picked or mex in bob_picked:
        mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

This program correctly simulates the turns of Alice and Bob and calculates the MEX of the resulting array `c` based on their optimal strategies.
