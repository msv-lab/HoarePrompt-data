### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine if it is possible to transform the array into a sorted array by repeatedly splitting elements that are at least 10 into their individual digits.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
            a = list1[p - 1]
            list1.pop(p - 1)
            list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
            list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
```

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1` checks if the list is sorted in ascending order and returns `True` if it is, otherwise `False`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element. If the previous element is greater than the current element and is at least 10, it splits the previous element into its digits.
   - **Issue**: The loop logic does not handle the case where the previous element is less than 10. The program incorrectly attempts to split elements that are less than 10, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function simply checks if the list is sorted. It does not handle the digit splitting operation and is used to check the final state of the list after transformations.

3. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     12 1 3
     ```
   - The program will attempt to split the element `1`, which is less than 10, leading to an incorrect transformation of the array `[12, 1, 3]` to `[12, 1, 0, 3]`. This violates the problem constraints, making the program incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program incorrectly handles elements less than 10, violating the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
