Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `list1`.

2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program checks if the current element is greater than the previous element and if it is greater than or equal to 10.
   - If both conditions are met, it splits the element into its individual digits and inserts them back into the array.
   - This operation is intended to help sort the array, but the implementation has some issues.

3. **Sorting Check:**
   - After potentially splitting elements, the program calls `func_1` to check if the array is sorted.
   - `func_1` simply compares the original list with its sorted version and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating the array is sorted.

### Issues in the Implementation

1. **Incorrect Operation Logic:**
   - The logic for splitting the element and inserting digits is flawed. The program should not modify the array in place during the iteration. Instead, it should simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible without actually modifying the array.
   - The current implementation directly modifies `list1`, which can lead to incorrect results if the array changes during the iteration.

2. **Missing Key Considerations:**
   - The program does not handle cases where splitting an element might create a larger number that could disrupt the sorting order.
   - The program does not consider edge cases like leading zeros or negative numbers (though the problem constraints restrict these).

3. **Incomplete Solution:**
   - The program only checks if the array can be sorted after one pass of the operation. However, the problem allows for multiple operations, so the solution needs to account for this.

### Corrected Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible. Hereâ€™s a revised approach:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Simulate the operation and check if sorting is possible
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        changed = False
        for i in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[i - 1] > list1[i] and list1[i - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[i - 1]
                list1[i - 1] = a // 10
                list1.insert(i, a % 10)
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            print('No')
            break
```

### Conclusion

Given the issues in the original implementation, the provided program is **incorrect**. The correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
