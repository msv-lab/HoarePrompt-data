Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where an element is less than 10. According to the problem description, only elements that are at least 10 can be split into their individual digits. However, the program attempts to split elements that are less than 10, which is not allowed. For example, consider the input:

```
3
12 1 3
```

The program will attempt to split the element `1`, which is less than 10, leading to an incorrect transformation of the array. This violates the problem constraints, making the program incorrect.
