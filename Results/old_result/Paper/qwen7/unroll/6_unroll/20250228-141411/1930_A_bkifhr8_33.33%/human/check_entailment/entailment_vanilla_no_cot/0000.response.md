Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of List Length**: The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect. The list `lst` should be processed in pairs until all elements are removed, not just checking if its length is 2.

2. **Indexing Issue**: The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. It should be `lst.remove(lst.pop(0))` and `lst.remove(lst.pop(0))` to remove the first two elements of the list.

3. **Break Statement Misuse**: The `break` statement is unnecessary and incorrectly placed. It should continue processing the list until all elements are removed.

4. **Input Parsing**: The input parsing for the list of numbers is done in an inefficient manner. Using `split(' ')` followed by `int()` conversions can lead to issues if there are spaces or other characters that are not intended.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest pair
        lst.sort()
        
        ans = 0
        while lst:
            # Take the first two elements and add the minimum to the score
            ans += lst.pop(0)
            if lst:
                ans += lst.pop(0)
        
        ans_f.append(ans)
    
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the list is sorted before processing, which guarantees that the minimum values are always chosen for each pair, leading to the optimal solution.
