Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head:
   - The loop head is `for i in range(t):`
   - The variables involved are `i` and `t`.

2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `t` is an input integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `i` is initialized to 0 before entering the loop.

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < t`.
   - Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = t-1`.

4. Adjust the state accordingly:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue running until `i` reaches `t-1`.
   - This means `t` must be a valid integer within the given range, and `i` should start at 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (which must be a valid integer between 1 and 5000) and `i` (which should start at 0).

State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `i` is 0**
