You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        ans = 0
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = l.split(' ')
        for i in range(n * 2):
            if len(lst) != 2:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
                lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
            else:
                ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
                break
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each case involves an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of numbers from the given list and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list on a new line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - An empty list `ans_f` is initialized to store the results for each test case.
   - A variable `ans` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the score for the current test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the program splits the input string into a list of integers.
   - It then iterates over the list, trying to find pairs of integers to process.
   - However, the logic inside the loop has some issues:
     - The condition `if len(lst) != 2:` is incorrect because the list `lst` should always have at least 2 elements when entering the loop since we are processing pairs.
     - The indices used in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` are incorrect. These should be `lst.remove(lst[0])` and `lst.remove(lst[1])` respectively.
     - The loop breaks prematurely after the first iteration if the list length is 2, which is not necessary.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - To maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available numbers.
   - We can sort the list and then sum up every other element starting from the first element.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input().split(' ')
        lst = [int(x) for x in l]
        lst.sort()  # Sort the list to ensure we always pick the smallest numbers
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, len(lst), 2))  # Sum every other element starting from the first
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for i in ans_f:
        print(i)
```

### Verification:

- The corrected program sorts the list and sums up every other element starting from the first, which ensures that the smallest numbers are paired together, maximizing the score.
- This approach guarantees the optimal solution as it always pairs the smallest available numbers.

### Conclusion:

The original program had logical errors in how it processed the list and removed elements. The corrected program uses a more straightforward and optimal approach.
