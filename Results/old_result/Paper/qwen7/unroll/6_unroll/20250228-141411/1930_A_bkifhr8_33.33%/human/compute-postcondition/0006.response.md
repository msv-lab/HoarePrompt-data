Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the elements of `ans_f`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the elements of `ans_f`, the first element of `ans_f` will be assigned to `i` in the first iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `ans_f` has at least one element.

3. **Understand the content of `ans_f`**: The problem states that `ans_f` contains the sum of the minimum values of pairs of numbers read from input, repeated `n * 2` times for each `n` provided, where `n` is the value of `t`. This means that `ans_f` is a list of integers.

4. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must contain at least one element. If `ans_f` is empty, the loop will not execute at all.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `ans_f` is not empty. The other variables (`t`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `ans_f` must contain at least one element.

**State:**
**`ans_f` must contain at least one element**
