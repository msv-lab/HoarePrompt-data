Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each case involves an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum values of all possible pairs of numbers from the given list and stores these sums in a list. Finally, it prints each sum from the list on a new line.**
