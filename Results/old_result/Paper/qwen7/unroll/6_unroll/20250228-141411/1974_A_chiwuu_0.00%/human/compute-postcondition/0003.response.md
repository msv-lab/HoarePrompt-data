Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer after all iterations of the loop have executed. The value of `t` is determined by the operations inside the loop based on the inputs provided for each iteration of `i` in `range(n)`. Specifically, `t` is updated based on the conditions involving `a`, `b`, and arithmetic operations, ensuring it never falls below 1 or exceeds 10^4.
