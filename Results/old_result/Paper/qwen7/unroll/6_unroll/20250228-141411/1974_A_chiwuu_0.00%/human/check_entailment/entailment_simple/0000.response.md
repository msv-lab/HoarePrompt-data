Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place the icons.

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens**:
   - The variable `t` is initialized as `b * 2`, which accounts for the space taken by 2x2 icons since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - If `t % 5 == 0`, it means the total space taken by 2x2 icons is exactly divisible by 5, so `t` is set to `t // 5`.
   - Otherwise, `t` is set to `t // 5 + 1`, which accounts for any remainder when dividing by 5, ensuring we account for the full screens used.
   - `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which represents the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all 1x1 icons without needing additional screens.
   - Otherwise, `t2` is calculated as `a - t1`, representing the number of 1x1 icons that need to be placed in additional screens.
   - Depending on whether `t2` is divisible by 15 or not, `t` is incremented accordingly to account for these additional screens.

3. **Output**:
   - The final value of `t` is printed, which should be the minimum number of screens required.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The calculation of `t1` does not properly account for the placement of 1x1 icons within the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons.
- The logic for determining the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is flawed. It assumes that every 15 cells can hold 15 icons, but this is not always true because the remaining space might not be a multiple of 15.

To fix the logic, we need to ensure that we correctly calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit into that space.

Here is a corrected version of the logic:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 4) // 5  # Each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells, and we round up to the nearest 5
        
        # Calculate the remaining space after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_space = 5 * t - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons
        t1 = (a + remaining_space - 1) // 15  # Ceiling division to account for partial screens
        
        # Total screens needed
        print(t + t1)
```

Given the above analysis, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
