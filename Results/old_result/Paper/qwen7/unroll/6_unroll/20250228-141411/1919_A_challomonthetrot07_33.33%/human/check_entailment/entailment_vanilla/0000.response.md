Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   
2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The program checks if `a` (Alice's coins) is equal to `b` (Bob's coins). If they are equal, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if both have the same number of coins, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring he wins.
   
3. **Single Coin Condition**:
   - If `a` is 1, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice has 1 coin and Bob has any number of coins, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.
   
4. **Single Coin for Bob**:
   - If `b` is 1, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Bob has 1 coin and Alice has any number of coins, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.
   
5. **Odd Number of Coins for Alice**:
   - If `a` is odd, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice has an odd number of coins, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins.
   
6. **Even Number of Coins for Alice and Odd Number of Coins for Bob**:
   - If `a` is even and `b` is odd, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with an even number of coins.
   
7. **More Coins for Alice**:
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints "Bob". This is correct because if Alice has more coins than Bob, she can always force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin, leaving Bob with fewer coins.
   
8. **Else Case**:
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "Alice". This is correct because if none of the above conditions hold, the remaining cases imply that Alice has fewer coins than Bob and an even number of coins, which means Bob can always force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and then removing the last coin.

### Conclusion

After analyzing each condition and its logic, the program appears to handle all possible scenarios correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
