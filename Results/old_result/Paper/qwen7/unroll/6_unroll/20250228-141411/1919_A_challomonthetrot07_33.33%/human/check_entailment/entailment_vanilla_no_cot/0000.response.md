Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner based on optimal play. Let's analyze why:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - The solution checks several conditions but does not fully capture the optimal strategy for both players.
   - For instance, the condition `elif a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:` suggests that if Alice's coins are even and Bob's are odd, Alice wins. This is not always true.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The key insight is that the player whose number of coins is odd will always have a winning strategy if both play optimally. This is because the player with an odd number of coins can force the opponent into a losing position by always leaving an even number of coins for the opponent.
   - Specifically, if either `a` or `b` is odd, the player with that odd number of coins will win. Otherwise, the player with the even number of coins will win.

3. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct approach is to check if either `a` or `b` is odd. If one of them is odd, the corresponding player (Alice or Bob) wins. If both are even, the player who starts (Alice) will lose since she will eventually be left with an even number of coins and Bob can always respond with an even number, forcing Alice to lose.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This code checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is odd. If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This aligns with the optimal strategy and matches the provided examples.
