Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. The number of lines will be equal to the value of `n`. Each line's content is determined by the conditions specified in the loop body, based on the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` provided as input for each iteration. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from the initial state, but `n` dictates the length of the output sequence.
