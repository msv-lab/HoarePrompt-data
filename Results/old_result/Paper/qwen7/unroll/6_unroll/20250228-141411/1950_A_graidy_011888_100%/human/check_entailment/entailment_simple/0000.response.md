Reasoning:
1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b and b > c`).
4. If the conditions for a stair are met, it prints "STAIR".
5. If the conditions for a peak are met, it prints "PEAK".
6. Otherwise, it prints "NONE".

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` matches the requirements exactly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
