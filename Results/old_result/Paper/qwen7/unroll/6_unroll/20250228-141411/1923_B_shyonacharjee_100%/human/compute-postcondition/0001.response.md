Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the State**: We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. Given that `t` is an input integer and the loop will execute as long as `t > 0`, we need to make sure `t` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be a positive integer.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4**
