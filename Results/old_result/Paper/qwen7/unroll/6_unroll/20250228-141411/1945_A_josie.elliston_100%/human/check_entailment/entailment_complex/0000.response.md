Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function takes `extroverts` and `universals` as inputs.
   - If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3, it checks if `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`. If this condition fails, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3` and returns it.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as inputs.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and handles the returned value:
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it returns `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and the result of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the given values of `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`.
   - For each test case, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required based on the logic implemented in `func_2`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The constraints (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) are handled appropriately by the functions.
   - The logic for handling the impossibility of accommodation (returning `-1`) is correctly implemented.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the program:
     - For the first test case (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals), the program correctly outputs `3`.
     - For the second test case (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal), the program correctly outputs `-1` because it's impossible to accommodate the remaining extrovert.
     - Other test cases also align with the expected outcomes.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the participants according to their preferences, and it handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
