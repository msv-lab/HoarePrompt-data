Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 4 1` (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal)

According to the problem description:
- 1 introvert requires 1 tent.
- 4 extroverts require 2 tents (since 4 extroverts can be paired into 2 groups of 2).
- 1 universal can pair with 1 extrovert, leaving 3 extroverts unpaired.

The program calculates the number of tents required using `func_2`, which calls `func_1` to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals. However, `func_1` does not correctly handle the scenario where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals and another extrovert. In this case, the program would incorrectly return 3 tents instead of -1 because it does not account for the fact that 3 extroverts cannot form a valid group.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the number of extroverts exceeds the combined number of universals and one less extrovert before calculating the number of tents.
