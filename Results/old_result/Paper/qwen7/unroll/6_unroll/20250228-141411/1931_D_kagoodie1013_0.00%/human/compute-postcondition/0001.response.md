Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the following variables and objects:
   - `(n, x, y, arr)` from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - `results` is an empty list and is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need adjustment.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will iterate over each tuple in `test_cases`.
   - Each tuple must contain valid values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over each tuple in `test_cases`, the initial state should ensure that there is at least one tuple in `test_cases` for the loop to execute.
   - For each tuple, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` must be valid and correctly structured.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple, and each tuple must have the correct structure with valid values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must contain at least one tuple, and each tuple must have the form (n, x, y, arr) where n, x, y are integers and arr is a list of integers**.
