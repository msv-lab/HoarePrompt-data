Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers representing the elements of the array. The function returns a list of integers, where each integer is the count calculated from the corresponding array according to the given logic in the test_cases.**

This means the function processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes the size of an array and two favorite integers (x and y), followed by the array elements. For each test case, the function calculates a specific count based on the array and returns a list of these counts.
