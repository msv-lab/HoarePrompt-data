Output State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) representing the size of the array and Polycarp's favorite integers, followed by a list of n integers representing the elements of the array; `results` is a list containing the sum of counts for each test case after executing the inner loop for all arrays in `test_cases`. Each count is calculated based on the number of occurrences of each modulus value for `-num % x` and `num % y` across the array elements.
