Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The approach used in `func_1` is sound and should work for the given constraints. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all the input at once and then processes it, which is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it calculates the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to keep track of the counts of remainders when elements are divided by `x` and `y`.
3. **Counting Pairs**: It iterates through the array, calculating the necessary remainders and using the dictionaries to count how many pairs satisfy the conditions for being beautiful pairs.
4. **Output**: The results are stored and printed correctly.

Given the problem description and the example provided, the program correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
