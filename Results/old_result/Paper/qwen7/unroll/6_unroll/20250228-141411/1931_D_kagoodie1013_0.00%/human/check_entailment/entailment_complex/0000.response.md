Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases. Each test case consists of the size of the array (`n`), the integers `x` and `y`, and the array itself. This part is implemented correctly.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - Two dictionaries, `mod_x_map` and `mod_y_map`, are used to keep track of the frequency of remainders when the elements of the array are divided by `x` and `-y` respectively.
   - As it iterates through the array, it updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainder values and increments the count based on the existing entries in the dictionaries.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the results list.

3. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case, which is the count of beautiful pairs for each array.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each array according to the specified conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
