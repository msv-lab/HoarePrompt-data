Let's analyze the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `for _ in range(int(input()))` to handle multiple test cases.
   - This means it will read the number of test cases and process each one individually.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `func_1()` is defined, which is called for each test case.
   
3. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, a list `a` is created with integers from `1` to `n`.
   - The list `a` is then modified such that every other element starting from the first element (even indices) is reversed.
   - Specifically, `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every other element in the list starting from index `0`.

4. **Output**:
   - The modified list `a` is printed.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

- **Permutation**: The list generated by reversing every other element in `[1, 2, ..., n]` is indeed a permutation of length `n`. This satisfies the requirement that the list contains distinct integers from `1` to `n`.

- **Divisibility Condition**: We need to check if the generated permutation satisfies the condition that there do not exist two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\).

  - Consider the generated permutation. If we take any pair of elements \(p_i\) and \(p_{i+1}\), they are consecutive elements in the original list but with their positions swapped. 
  - Since the original list contains numbers from `1` to `n` and the swapping only affects even-indexed elements, the divisibility condition is unlikely to hold for any pair of elements because the numbers are relatively prime or have different magnitudes when considered in this specific arrangement.

### Examples:

- For `n = 4`, the permutation generated is `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
  - Checking pairs: 
    - \(p_1 = 4\), \(p_2 = 1\): 4 does not divide 1.
    - \(p_2 = 1\), \(p_3 = 2\): 1 does not divide 2.
    - \(p_3 = 2\), \(p_4 = 3\): 2 does not divide 3.
  - No pair violates the condition.

- For `n = 3`, the permutation generated is `[3, 1, 2]`.
  - Checking pairs:
    - \(p_1 = 3\), \(p_2 = 1\): 3 does not divide 1.
    - \(p_2 = 1\), \(p_3 = 2\): 1 does not divide 2.
  - No pair violates the condition.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly generates a permutation that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
