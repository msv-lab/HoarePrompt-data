Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) and an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). For each test case, it generates a list of integers from 1 to `t`, reverses every second element in the list, and prints the modified list. The function does not return any value but prints the processed list for each test case.**
