Output State: **day is 'AM' or 'PM', n is 0, h is 00, m is 00.**

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, each time taking input for `h` and `m`. After all iterations, the loop ends, and since no operation changes the value of `n`, `day`, or `h` and `m` are reset to their initial states when the loop finishes. Thus, `n` becomes 0, and `day` and `h:m` are reset to their initial values of 'AM' and '00:00' respectively.
