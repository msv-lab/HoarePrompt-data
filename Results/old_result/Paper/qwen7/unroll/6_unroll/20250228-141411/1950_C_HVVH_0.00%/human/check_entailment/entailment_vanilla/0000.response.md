Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` initializes the variable `day` to `'AM'`.
   - It reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` in the format `hh:mm`.

2. **Time Conversion Logic:**
   - The program splits the string `s` into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) using `map(int, input().split(':'))`.
   - If `h` is `0`, it sets `h` to `12` and `day` to `'AM'`. This is correct because `00:00` in 24-hour format is `12:00 AM` in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from `h` and sets `day` to `'PM'`. This is also correct because times like `13:00` to `23:00` in 24-hour format are `01:00 PM` to `11:00 PM` in 12-hour format.
   - If `h` is between `1` and `11`, it incorrectly sets `day` to `'PM'` if `h` is `12`. This is incorrect because `12:00` in 24-hour format is `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format, not `12:00 AM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints the formatted time and `day` using `print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)`. This part is correct as long as the logic for determining `day` is correct.

### Conclusion:

The program has a logical error in how it handles the hour `12`. Specifically, when `h` is `12`, it incorrectly sets `day` to `'PM'` instead of `'AM'`. This means that any time `12:xx` will be incorrectly converted to `12:xx PM` instead of `12:xx AM`.

### Correctness:

Given the analysis, the program is incorrect due to the mistake in handling the hour `12`.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
