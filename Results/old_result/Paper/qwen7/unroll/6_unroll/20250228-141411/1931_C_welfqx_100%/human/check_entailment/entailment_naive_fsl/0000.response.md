Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the array has multiple distinct segments that need to be made uniform. 

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
4
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
7
1 1 1 1 1 1 1
8
8 8 8 1 2 8 8 8
9
9 9 2 9 2 5 5 5 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
4
0
2
7
```
- Actual Output:
```
4
0
2
6
```
The program incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the last test case. The correct minimum cost should be 7, but the program outputs 6. This happens because the program only considers the longest consecutive segment of the same number and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal by potentially merging different segments.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible segments and their costs, and then find the minimum cost among these options.
