Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the code is flawed and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal using the allowed operation. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The code attempts to find consecutive equal elements from both ends of the array but does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal through a single operation that spans the entire array where necessary.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Cost**: The logic to calculate the minimum cost does not properly handle cases where the array needs to be made uniform across its entire length. Specifically, the code incorrectly assumes that reversing and comparing helps in finding the optimal solution.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The code fails to handle edge cases where the array might require a single operation to make all elements equal, such as when the array has a mix of different values requiring a spanning operation.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one should identify the minimum cost operation that makes all elements equal. This involves finding the most frequent element in the array and calculating the cost of changing all other elements to this most frequent element.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for r in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        num = [int(_) for _ in input().split()]
        
        # Count the frequency of each element
        freq = {}
        for val in num:
            if val in freq:
                freq[val] += 1
            else:
                freq[val] = 1
        
        # Find the most frequent element
        most_frequent_val = max(freq, key=freq.get)
        most_frequent_count = freq[most_frequent_val]
        
        # Calculate the cost
        cost = n - most_frequent_count
        
        print(cost)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly identifies the most frequent element and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal to this most frequent element.
