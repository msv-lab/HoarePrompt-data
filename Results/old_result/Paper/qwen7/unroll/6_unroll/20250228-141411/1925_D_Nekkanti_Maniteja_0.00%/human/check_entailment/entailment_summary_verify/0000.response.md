Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis

The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The key points are:
1. Each excursion randomly selects a pair of children.
2. If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
3. The friendship value of a non-friend pair remains 0 and does not change.

The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion can be derived using the concept of expected value in probability theory.

### Expected Value Calculation

For each pair of friends \((u, v)\) with friendship value \(f_{uv}\):
- The probability of selecting this pair in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
- If selected, the friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

Thus, the expected increase in the friendship value for each pair of friends after \(k\) excursions is:
\[ E_{uv} = \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\right)^k\right) \cdot f_{uv} \]

Summing over all pairs of friends gives the total expected value:
\[ E = \sum_{(u,v) \in \text{friends}} E_{uv} \]

### Provided Program Analysis

The provided program does not correctly implement the expected value calculation. Here's why:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program calculates the modular inverse \(c\) of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is not necessary for the expected value calculation.
2. **Incorrect Summation**: The program sums the friendship values of all pairs of friends and multiplies by a constant factor, which does not reflect the expected value calculation.
3. **Lack of Probability Consideration**: The program does not account for the probability of selecting each pair of friends and how their friendship value changes over the \(k\) excursions.

### Correct Implementation

To correctly implement the expected value calculation, we need to:
1. Calculate the expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends.
2. Sum these expected values for all pairs of friends.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import comb

def func():
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = []
        for _ in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            pairs.append((u, v, f))
        
        # Calculate the expected value for each pair of friends
        expected_value = 0
        for u, v, f in pairs:
            prob_select = 2 / (n * (n - 1))
            prob_not_select_all_k = (1 - prob_select) ** k
            expected_increase = (1 - prob_not_select_all_k) * f
            expected_value += expected_increase
        
        # Output the expected value modulo MOD
        print(int(expected_value % MOD))
```

This implementation correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.

Final: **False**
