Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions respectively.
   - It then reads `m` lines, each containing `u`, `v`, and `f` representing the indices of the pair of children and their friendship value.

2. **Calculating the Inverse:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - This is done using `pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)`.

3. **Summing Friendship Values:**
   - The program initializes `a` to 0 and sums up all the friendship values from the input pairs.
   - This is done with the loop `for i in range(m): (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split()); a += f`.

4. **Calculating Expected Value:**
   - The program then iterates `k` times, each time adding to `s` the value calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
   - This calculation seems to be an attempt to compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen for the excursions.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, the program prints the result of `s % M` which is the expected value modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The formula used in the program `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly model the expected value of the sum of friendship values.
   - The expected value should consider the probability of picking each pair and how the friendship value changes over the excursions.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The modular inverse of \( \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} \) is not necessary for solving this problem. The problem does not require the total number of possible pairs, just the expected value of the sum of friendship values.

3. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each excursion and summing these expectations.

### Correct Solution Approach:
- For each pair of friends, the expected value of the friendship value after `k` excursions is \( k \times \text{initial friendship value} \).
- Sum these expected values for all pairs of friends.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect formula used for calculating the expected value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
