Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. Additionally, c is the modular inverse of n * (n - 1) // 2 under modulo 10^9 + 7, a is the sum of f_i for all edges, s is calculated as (c * i * c * m + c * a) summed up to k, and the final result is taken modulo 10^9 + 7.
