Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not address the main requirement of performing k operations to maximize the sum of the array. 

- `func_1` simply returns the input number modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is unrelated to the problem.
- `func_2` attempts to find the maximum sum segment but does not account for the k operations needed to maximize the array sum. It only finds the maximum sum segment once and does not incorporate the ability to insert sums of subarrays multiple times.
- `func_3` is completely unused and does not contribute to solving the problem.

Given these issues, the program fails to correctly implement the logic required to maximize the array sum through k operations. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
