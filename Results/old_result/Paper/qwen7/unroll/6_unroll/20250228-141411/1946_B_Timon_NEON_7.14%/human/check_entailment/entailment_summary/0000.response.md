### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations. Each operation allows selecting any contiguous subarray and inserting its sum into the array. The goal is to maximize the sum of the array.

2. **Key Insights**:
   - The key insight is that the optimal strategy involves repeatedly adding the largest possible positive subarray sums to the array.
   - The `func_2` function aims to find the subarray with the highest sum, which is crucial for determining the maximum possible sum after `k` operations.
   - The `func_1` function simply computes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_2**: This function correctly identifies the subarray with the highest sum. It iterates through the array, keeping track of the current segment sum and updating the maximum segment sum found so far. It also handles cases where the segment sum becomes negative by resetting the segment and updating the maximum segment accordingly.
   - **func_1**: This function correctly applies the modulo operation to the result.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the subarray with the highest sum using `func_2`.
   - The formula used to compute the maximum possible sum after `k` operations is correct: 
     \[
     \text{max\_segment} \times 2^k + \text{sum}(a) - \text{max\_segment}
     \]
     This formula accounts for the fact that we can insert the maximum segment sum `k` times, and the remaining elements contribute their sum minus the maximum segment sum once.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like empty subarrays and negative sums appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
