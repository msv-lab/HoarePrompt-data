### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to eliminate the substrings "pie" or "map". The provided solution iterates through the string and counts how many times it encounters these substrings.

2. **Iterating Through the String**: 
   - The loop `while i < len(a) - 2:` ensures that we only check up to the point where the next two characters still exist, preventing out-of-bounds errors.
   - For each position `i`, it checks the substring `a[i:i+3]` to see if it matches "pie" or "map".

3. **Counting Removals**:
   - If the substring matches "pie" or "map", it increments the counter `ans` and skips ahead by 3 characters (`i += 3`).
   - If it does not match, it simply moves to the next character (`i += 1`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The loop correctly handles overlapping cases. For example, in the string "ppiee", it would find "pie" at index 0 and increment `ans` and `i` to 3, then move to the next character without finding another "pie".
   - It also handles cases where the string ends before finding another "pie" or "map".

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it prints the count of removals, which is the minimum number of characters needed to make the string beautiful.

6. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly identifies and removes the minimum number of characters to make the string free of "pie" or "map".
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement are handled correctly by the function.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
