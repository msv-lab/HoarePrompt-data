Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6), and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters with length `n`. It returns a result based on the processing of these inputs for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instruction to only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
