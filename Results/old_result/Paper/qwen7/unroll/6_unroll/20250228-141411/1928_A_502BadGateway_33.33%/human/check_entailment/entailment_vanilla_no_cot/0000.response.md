Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` only checks if `b` is even and returns 'yes' if it is, and 'no' otherwise. However, this logic is insufficient to determine whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions `a` and `b`.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should check if either dimension can be evenly divided by the other, allowing for the formation of another rectangle. Hereâ€™s an improved version of the function:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    print(func_1(a, b))

def func_1(a, b):
    # Check if either a or b can be divided by the other to form a new rectangle
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a  # Ensure a <= b for simplicity
    return 'Yes' if b % a == 0 else 'No'
```

This updated function correctly determines if Bob can form another rectangle by checking if one dimension can be evenly divided by the other.
