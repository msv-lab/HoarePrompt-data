Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial state, which is that `t` is now an integer representing the number of test cases.
