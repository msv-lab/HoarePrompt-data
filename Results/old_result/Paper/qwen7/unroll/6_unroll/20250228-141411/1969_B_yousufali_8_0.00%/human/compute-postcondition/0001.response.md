State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.
2. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.
3. Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it needs to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
4. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
