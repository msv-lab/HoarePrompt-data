Output State: `lst` is a defaultdict where each key represents a node and its value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The loop runs `x-1` times, each time adding two nodes `a` and `b` to each other's adjacency lists. The initial node `u_1` (with value `u`) will have edges added to it based on the inputs provided during the loop iterations.
