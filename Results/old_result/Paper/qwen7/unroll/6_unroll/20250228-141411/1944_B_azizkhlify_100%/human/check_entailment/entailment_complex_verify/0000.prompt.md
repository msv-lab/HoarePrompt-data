You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate two arrays \( l \) and \( r \) such that the bitwise XOR of elements in \( l \) equals the bitwise XOR of elements in \( r \). Specifically, the program attempts to construct \( l \) and \( r \) by directly selecting elements from the given array \( a \), which does not guarantee that the XOR values will match. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
2
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
6 2
5 1 3 3 5 1 2 6 4 6 4 2
```

For the first test case, the program outputs:
```
1 2
1 2
```
Here, the XOR of \( l = [1, 2] \) is \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \), and the XOR of \( r = [1, 2] \) is also \( 1 \oplus 2 = 3 \). This seems correct.

However, for the second test case, the program outputs:
```
5 1
5 1
```
Here, the XOR of \( l = [5, 1] \) is \( 5 \oplus 1 = 4 \), and the XOR of \( r = [5, 1] \) is also \( 5 \oplus 1 = 4 \). This also seems correct.

But consider another valid solution for the second test case:
```
3 3
3 3
```
Here, the XOR of \( l = [3, 3] \) is \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \), and the XOR of \( r = [3, 3] \) is also \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \).

The program, however, does not handle this scenario correctly. It constructs \( l \) and \( r \) by directly selecting elements without ensuring the XOR values match for all possible valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
