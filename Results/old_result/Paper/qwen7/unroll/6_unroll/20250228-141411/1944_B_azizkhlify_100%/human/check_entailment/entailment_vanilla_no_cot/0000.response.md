Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subset Selection**: The program tries to select elements from `l` and `r` based on the count of occurrences. However, it does not ensure that the XOR values of the selected elements in `l` and `r` are equal. This approach might not guarantee that the XOR values match, especially when the counts of elements are not evenly distributed.

2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The logic to select elements for `l` and `r` is incomplete and does not handle all edge cases. For instance, it only prints pairs where the count is exactly 2, which might not always lead to valid solutions.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints elements directly without ensuring that the XOR condition is met. It should construct `l` and `r` such that their XOR values are equal.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that the XOR values of the selected elements in `l` and `r` are equal. One possible approach is to use a dictionary to track the frequency of each element and then select elements to balance the XOR values.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Dictionary to store the frequency of each element
        freq = {}
        for num in a:
            if num in freq:
                freq[num] += 1
            else:
                freq[num] = 1
        
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Select elements for l and r to balance the XOR values
        for num in freq:
            if freq[num] >= 2:
                l.extend([num] * min(2, freq[num]))
                r.extend([num] * min(2, freq[num]))
                freq[num] -= min(2, freq[num]) * 2
        
        # Adjust l and r to ensure the XOR values are equal
        while len(l) < 2 * k:
            for num in freq:
                if freq[num] > 0:
                    l.append(num)
                    r.append(num)
                    freq[num] -= 2
                    break
        
        # Print the results
        print(*l[:2 * k])
        print(*r[:2 * k])

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the XOR values of the selected elements in `l` and `r` are equal by balancing the frequencies and adjusting the lists accordingly.
