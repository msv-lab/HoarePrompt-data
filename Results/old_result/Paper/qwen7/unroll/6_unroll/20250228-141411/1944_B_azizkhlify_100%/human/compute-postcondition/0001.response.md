Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each representing the results of a test case. For each test case, it first prints pairs of numbers (each number from 1 to n appearing exactly twice) that have been identified based on certain conditions. Then, it prints any remaining numbers that meet specific criteria. Finally, it prints the same numbers again in the order they were identified. If the counts of left and right pairs do not match, it continues to print pairs from the second half of the list until the counts match.

In more detail, for each test case:
1. It identifies and prints pairs of numbers from the first half of the list `a` that appear exactly twice.
2. It then prints additional numbers from the first half that meet certain conditions.
3. It prints the same numbers again.
4. If the counts of pairs from the first and second halves do not match, it continues to print pairs from the second half of the list until the counts match.
