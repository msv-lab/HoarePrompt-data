You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of 2n integers where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, along with two integers n and k. It prints pairs of numbers that appear exactly twice in the list and have their counts in the list `l` equal to 2, up to `k*2` such pairs. After printing these pairs, it prints the remaining numbers from the list `res`, which are the numbers that appeared once in the first half of the list `a` and are needed to reach `2*k - ul` unique numbers. Finally, it prints any pairs of numbers from the second half of the list `a` that have their counts in the list `r` equal to 2, until `ul` equals `ur`. Each line ends with a space-separated list of numbers printed during the test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to store the selected elements.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are used to keep track of the number of elements selected for `l` and `r` and their respective XOR values.

3. **Counting Elements in `l`:**
   - The program counts how many times each element appears in the first half of the array (`a[0:n]`).
   - If an element appears twice, it prints those two elements and sets the count to zero.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If fewer than `2k` elements are selected for `l`, the program tries to select more elements from the first half where the count is 1.
   - This ensures that the total number of elements in `l` is `2k`.

5. **Printing `l`:**
   - The program prints the elements selected for `l`.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements for `r`:**
   - The program then selects corresponding elements from the second half of the array (`a[n:2n]`) to ensure the XOR values match.
   - It prints the elements selected for `r`.

7. **Ensuring Equal XOR Values:**
   - The program ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Elements:**
   - The logic for selecting remaining elements for `l` and `r` is flawed. Specifically, the program only considers elements with a count of 1 in the first half and doesn't ensure the total number of elements in `l` is `2k`.
   - The program should ensure that exactly `2k` elements are selected for `l` and `r` while maintaining the XOR condition.

2. **Incomplete Selection Logic:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the XOR condition cannot be satisfied with the current selection strategy. For example, if the XOR of the first half is different from the XOR of the second half, the program will fail to find a valid solution.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
