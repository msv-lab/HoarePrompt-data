Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.

Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `result` list at all. The only operation it performs is on the `array` list. However, the loop's body extends the `array` with its own contents in each iteration, which effectively doubles the length of the `array` in every step. Since the `array` starts as an empty list, and the loop does not add any new elements (only copies existing ones), the `array` will still be an empty list after the loop completes. The `result` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
Code of the loop:
for k in queries:
    result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
