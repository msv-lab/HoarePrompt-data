Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the array when `b = 2`. Instead of extending the array with `x` copies of itself, it only extends it with one copy of the current array. This leads to incorrect results for queries after operations of type 2.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

The expected behavior should be:

1. After the first operation: `a = [1]`
2. After the second operation: `a = [1, 2]`
3. After the third operation (extend by 1 copy): `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`
4. After the fourth operation: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
5. After the fifth operation (extend by 3 copies): `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

However, the provided function will incorrectly extend the array only once, leading to an array like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` instead of the correct `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
