You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers (b, x), and queries is a list of integers k_i. The operations list describes the sequence of operations performed on the array a, and the queries list contains the positions k_i for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After executing the loop `t` times, for each iteration, we read `n` operations and `q` queries, process them using `func_1`, and print the results. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each line containing the results of `func_1` for the respective iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer representing the number of operations), q (an integer representing the number of queries), operations (a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers (b, x)), and queries (a list of integers k_i). It performs a series of operations on an array a based on the operations list and then returns the elements at the specified positions given in the queries list.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
