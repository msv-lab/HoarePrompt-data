You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: operations is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (op_type, value). op_type is either 1 or 2, and value is an integer for op_type 1 and an integer for op_type 2 indicating the number of copies to append. queries is a list of integers k_i representing the positions Jayden wants to know the elements at.
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify the `result` list at all. The only operation it performs is on the `array` list. However, the loop's body extends the `array` with its own contents in each iteration, which effectively doubles the length of the `array` in every step. Since the `array` starts as an empty list, and the loop does not add any new elements (only copies existing ones), the `array` will still be an empty list after the loop completes. The `result` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list.
    return result
    #The program returns an empty list named result
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. `operations` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (`op_type`, `value`), and `queries` is a list of integers `k_i`. The function processes the `operations` to potentially modify an `array`, but since the operations do not add any new elements to the `array`, it remains empty. The function then iterates over the `queries` and appends the same element (which is always the first element due to the empty `array`) to the `result` list for each query. Finally, the function returns an empty list named `result`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of operations, q is an integer representing the number of queries, operations is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers (b, x), and queries is a list of integers k_i. The operations list describes the sequence of operations performed on the array a, and the queries list contains the positions k_i for which the k-th element of the final array a needs to be determined.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        
        print(*result)
        
    #State: After executing the loop `t` times, for each iteration, we read `n` operations and `q` queries, process them using `func_1`, and print the results. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each line containing the results of `func_1` for the respective iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: the number of operations (n), the number of queries (q), a list of operations (each operation being a list of two integers b and x), and a list of query positions (queries). It processes these operations on an array and returns the values at the specified query positions. The function runs this process t times, where t is the number of inputs provided via the initial loop.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the operations described in the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly simulate the appending of `x` copies of the array when `b = 2`. Instead of extending the array with `x` copies of itself, it only extends it with one copy of the current array. This leads to incorrect results for queries after operations of type 2.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

The expected behavior should be:

1. After the first operation: `a = [1]`
2. After the second operation: `a = [1, 2]`
3. After the third operation (extend by 1 copy): `a = [1, 2, 1, 2]`
4. After the fourth operation: `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`
5. After the fifth operation (extend by 3 copies): `a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`

However, the provided function will incorrectly extend the array only once, leading to an array like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` instead of the correct `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`.

This discrepancy shows that the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
