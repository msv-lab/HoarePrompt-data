Output State: **After executing the loop `t` times, for each iteration, we read `n` operations and `q` queries, process them using `func_1`, and print the results. The final output state consists of `t` lines, each line containing the results of `func_1` for the respective iteration.**

This means that the output will consist of `t` lines, with each line containing the output of `func_1` for the corresponding set of operations and queries processed in each iteration of the loop.
