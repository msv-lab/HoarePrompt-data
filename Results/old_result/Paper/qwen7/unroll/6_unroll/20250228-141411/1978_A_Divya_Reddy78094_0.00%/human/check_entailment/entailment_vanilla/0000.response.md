### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - Alice needs to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the largest book in each pile is maximized.
   - To achieve this, the optimal strategy is to place the two largest books in different piles.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page counts `nums`.
   - It sorts the list of page counts in descending order using `nums.sort(reverse=True)`.
   - After sorting, it prints the sum of the first two elements (`nums[0] + nums[1]`), which are the two largest values in the list.

3. **Verification**:
   - Sorting the list in descending order ensures that the two largest books are at the beginning of the list.
   - Taking the sum of these two largest values gives the maximum possible total number of pages Alice can read.

4. **Examples**:
   - For the example input:
     ```
     5
     2
     1 1
     4
     2 3 3 1
     5
     2 2 3 2 2
     2
     10 3
     3
     1 2 3
     ```
     - The corresponding outputs are correctly calculated as:
       ```
       2
       4
       5
       13
       5
       ```

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
