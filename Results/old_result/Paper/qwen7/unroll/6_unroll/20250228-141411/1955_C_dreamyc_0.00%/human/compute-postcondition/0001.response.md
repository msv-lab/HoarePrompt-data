Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. Since no other operations are performed on `t`, `n`, `k`, or `nums`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `ans`.
