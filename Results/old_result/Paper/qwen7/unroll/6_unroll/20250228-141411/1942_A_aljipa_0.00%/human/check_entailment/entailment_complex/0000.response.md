Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a\) such that exactly \(k\) out of its \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this problem by generating specific arrays based on the values of \(n\) and \(k\).
3. Specifically:
   - If \(k = n\), the program prints a list of \(n\) ones. This is correct because all cyclic shifts of a list of identical elements are sorted.
   - If \(k = 1\), the program prints a list containing numbers from 0 to \(n-1\). This is also correct because only one cyclic shift (the original list) is sorted.
   - In all other cases, the program prints -1, indicating no valid array exists for those \(n\) and \(k\).

However, the program logic does not correctly handle the requirement that exactly \(k\) cyclic shifts should be sorted. Instead, it uses a simple conditional check to decide the output based on whether \(k\) equals \(n\) or \(k\) equals 1, without considering the actual number of sorted cyclic shifts.

To properly solve the problem, the program would need to generate an array where exactly \(k\) out of \(n\) cyclic shifts are sorted. The current implementation does not achieve this.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
