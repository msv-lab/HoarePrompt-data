### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of its `n` cyclic shifts are sorted. If no such array exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then generates a result list `res` based on the values of `k` and `n`:
     - If `k == n`, it sets `res` to `[1] * n`. This means every cyclic shift would be sorted.
     - If `k == 1`, it sets `res` to `range(n)`. This means only one specific cyclic shift will be sorted.
     - Otherwise, it sets `res` to `[-1]`, indicating no valid array can be found.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - For `k == n`: The array `[1] * n` ensures that every cyclic shift is sorted because all elements are the same.
   - For `k == 1`: The array `range(n)` ensures that only one specific cyclic shift is sorted. For example, for `n = 3`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has only one sorted cyclic shift `[0, 1, 2]`.
   - However, the logic for `k == 1` is flawed. The array `range(n)` does not ensure that only one specific cyclic shift is sorted. Instead, it ensures that the first cyclic shift is sorted. For example, for `n = 3`, the array `[0, 1, 2]` has three cyclic shifts: `[0, 1, 2]`, `[1, 2, 0]`, and `[2, 0, 1]`. All of these are sorted, not just one.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where `k == 1`. It assumes that `range(n)` will give exactly one sorted cyclic shift, but this is not true. As shown above, for `n = 3`, `range(3)` results in all three cyclic shifts being sorted.
   - The logic for `k == n` is correct, but the logic for `k == 1` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where `k == 1`. The array `range(n)` does not ensure that only one specific cyclic shift is sorted.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
