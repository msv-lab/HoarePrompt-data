Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to place supports in a single row of the river.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost positions for placing supports within the specified distance `d`.
   - The function ensures that the first and last supports are placed at the boundaries of the row.
   - It iterates through the row and updates the cost of placing supports according to the rules given.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire input and outputs the minimum cost for building multiple bridges.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It constructs a list of costs for each row using the `func_1` function.
   - It then calculates the total cost for placing bridges on consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost among these possibilities.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in both functions, the program correctly computes the minimum total cost for placing supports across multiple rows. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
