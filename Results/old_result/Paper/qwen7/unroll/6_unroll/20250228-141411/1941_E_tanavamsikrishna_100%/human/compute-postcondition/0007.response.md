Based on the initial state, `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of every consecutive sub-list of `costs` with length `k`. 

To determine what will be printed by `print(min(total_costs))`, we need to consider the following:

1. `total_costs` is constructed from `costs` by taking every consecutive sub-list of length `k` and summing them up.
2. Since `total_costs` is a list of these sums, `min(total_costs)` will find the smallest sum among these sub-lists.

However, without the actual values of `costs` and the specific values of `n` and `k`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of the minimum sum. But we know that `min(total_costs)` will return the smallest sum of any consecutive sub-list of `costs` of length `k`.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of every consecutive sub-list of costs with length k)**
