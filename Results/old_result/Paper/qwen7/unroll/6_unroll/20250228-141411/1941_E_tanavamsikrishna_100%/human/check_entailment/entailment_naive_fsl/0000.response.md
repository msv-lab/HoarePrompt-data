Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost of installing supports for building bridges. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the placement of supports according to the problem constraints. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Support Placement**: The function `func_1` aims to place supports such that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, the logic inside the function does not ensure this condition is met. For example, consider a row with the following depths: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]` and `d = 4`. The function should place supports at positions `(0, 1)`, `(0, 5)`, and possibly others to meet the distance constraint. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this.

2. **Heap Usage Misunderstanding**: The use of a min-heap in `func_1` is intended to keep track of the minimum cost to place supports up to a certain point. However, the logic for updating the heap and placing supports is flawed. The while loop inside the heap operations does not correctly handle the removal of outdated elements from the heap, leading to incorrect support placements.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle edge cases where the row might have varying depths and the distance constraint needs to be strictly followed. For instance, a row with `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]` and `d = 4` should result in supports being placed at specific intervals, but the current implementation fails to achieve this.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly compute the minimum cost for all possible inputs, making it incorrect.
