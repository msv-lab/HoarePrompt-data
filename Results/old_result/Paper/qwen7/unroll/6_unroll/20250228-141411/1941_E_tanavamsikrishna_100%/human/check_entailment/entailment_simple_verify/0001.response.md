### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to validate the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes the first element of the row to 1.
   - For the next `d-1` elements, it increments each by 2.
   - This part is straightforward and correctly handles the initial setup.

2. **Min-Heap Usage**:
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of placing supports up to a distance `d`.
   - For each element from index `d` onwards, it checks if the smallest element in the min-heap (considering elements from `row[:d]` and their indices) whose index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` has been popped and then reinserted into the heap twice.
   - This ensures that the distance between any two adjacent supports is no more than `d`.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The `heappop` and `heappush` operations are used to maintain the min-heap property.
   - The function correctly updates the cost of placing a support in each cell from index `d` onwards based on the minimum cost found in the previous `d` cells.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The function reads the dimensions of the grid and the depths of the river cells for each row.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Calculating Costs for Each Row**:
   - The function calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
   - This ensures that the cost of placing supports for each row is calculated correctly.

3. **Calculating Total Costs for Consecutive Rows**:
   - The function iterates through all possible starting rows for the bridges and calculates the total cost for each combination of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It then finds and prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge cases where the grid dimensions and the number of bridges are within the specified limits.

#### Overall Program Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river.
- The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented accurately according to the problem statement.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the river.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
