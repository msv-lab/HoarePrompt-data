### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the minimum cost of placing supports in a single row under the given constraints. However, there are a few issues with its implementation:
     - The initialization of the first `d` elements in the row is incorrect. It should only set the first element to 1 and the rest to 2, as the cost of placing a support in the first and last columns is always 1.
     - The logic inside the loop where the min-heap is used is flawed. It should ensure that the distance between any two adjacent supports is at most `d`, but the current implementation does not enforce this constraint properly.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` processes the entire grid to find the minimum cost of building `k` bridges. It correctly calls `func_1` for each row and stores the results in the `costs` list.
   - It then calculates the total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of the selected rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible combinations of `k` consecutive rows.

3. **Checking the Implementation**:
   - While `func_2` appears to be correct in its overall approach, the underlying `func_1` is flawed. The cost calculation in `func_1` does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports, which is crucial for the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, but the core logic in `func_1` is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly enforce the distance constraint between supports. As a result, the calculated minimum cost may be invalid.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
