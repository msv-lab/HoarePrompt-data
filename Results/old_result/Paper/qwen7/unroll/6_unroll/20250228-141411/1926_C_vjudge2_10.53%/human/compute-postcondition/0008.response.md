Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(10)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `10`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 in the `range(10)` function.
   - The variable `10` is the upper limit of the range, which determines how many times the loop will execute.

3. **Adjust the state based on the loop requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must start from 0 and go up to 9 (inclusive).
   - The value `10` must be correctly set as the upper limit for the range function.

4. **Consider the other given states**:
   - The list `numbers` contains `t` integers.
   - The list `values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.
   - The list `sum_values` is a list of length equal to the maximum value in `numbers` + 1, with all elements initialized to 0.
   - The variable `total` is initialized to 0.

Since these other states are not part of the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute. They remain as they are.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `10`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `10` must be the upper limit for the range function**
