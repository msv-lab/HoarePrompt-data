Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific integer value input by the user. All other variables remain unchanged, specifically, no new variables `n` are introduced, and the precondition regarding `n` remains valid but unaltered.
