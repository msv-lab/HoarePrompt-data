### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` processes multiple test cases.
- It reads an integer `t` and `t` integers `n`.
- It constructs two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, based on these integers and a predefined sequence.
- It prints the values from the `sum_values` list corresponding to the integers read in the test cases.
- The function does not return any value but modifies and uses global lists `values` and `sum_values` and an integer `total` during its execution.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   numbers = []
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       numbers.append(n)
   ```
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` for each test case.
   - It stores these values in the list `numbers`.

2. **Precomputation**:
   ```python
   values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
   sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max(numbers) + 1)]
   total = 0
   for i in range(10):
       values[i] = i
       total += i
       sum_values[i] = total
   ```
   - The program initializes two lists, `values` and `sum_values`, with a size equal to the maximum value in `numbers`.
   - It precomputes the sum of digits for numbers from 0 to 9 and stores these values in `values` and `sum_values`.
   - This part is correct for numbers from 0 to 9.

3. **Calculation for Numbers Greater Than 9**:
   ```python
   for i in range(10, n + 1):
       word = str(i)
       last = int(word[len(word) - 1])
       remainder = int(word[:-1])
       values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
       sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
       sum_values[i] = sum_total
   ```
   - For numbers greater than 9, the program attempts to split the number into its last digit and the remaining part.
   - It then uses the precomputed values to calculate the sum of digits.
   - However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly compute the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9. For example, for the number 12, it should calculate `1 + 2 = 3`, but instead, it uses the precomputed values incorrectly.

4. **Processing Test Cases**:
   ```python
   for n in numbers:
       print(sum_values[n])
   ```
   - The program iterates through the test cases and prints the values from the `sum_values` list.
   - This part is incorrect because `sum_values` is not correctly updated for numbers greater than 9.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The program attempts to precompute the sum of digits for all numbers up to `max(numbers)`, which is inefficient and unnecessary.
- The logic for calculating the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9 is flawed.
- The program does not correctly handle the test cases as intended.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the sum of digits for numbers greater than 9 and the incorrect handling of test cases.
