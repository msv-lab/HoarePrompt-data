Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

2. **Computation of Total Bet Amount:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is done using a loop where `m` is initialized to 1 and then multiplied by each `k[i]`.
   - This step is correct as it computes the total bet amount needed to ensure the condition is met if all multipliers were used.

3. **Distribution Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates a list `c` where each element is `m / k[i]`. This step is intended to find a distribution that satisfies the condition.
   - However, the logic here is flawed because the goal is to find a distribution where the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product `m`, not `m / k[i]`.

4. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The program calls a function `func_1` to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem at hand.
   - After computing the GCD, the program divides each element of `c` by the GCD. This step is also unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly.

5. **Validation and Output:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the elements in `c` is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If true, it prints `-1`, indicating no valid distribution exists.
   - If false, it prints the elements of `c`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`.
2. Distribute the coins such that the sum of the bets is strictly less than `m`.
3. One simple and valid approach is to set each bet to 1 (or any constant value less than `m / n`).

### Revised Program:
```python
from math import gcd

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = 1
    for i in range(n):
        m *= k[i]
    
    # Distribute 1 coin for each outcome
    c = [1] * n
    
    if sum(c) >= m / n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        for i in range(n):
            print(c[i], end=' ')
        print('')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical errors and unnecessary steps. A simpler and correct approach would be to distribute 1 coin for each outcome. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
