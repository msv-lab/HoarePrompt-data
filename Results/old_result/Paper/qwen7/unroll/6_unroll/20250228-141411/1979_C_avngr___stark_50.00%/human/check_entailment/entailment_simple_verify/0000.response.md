### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to understand why the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program aims to find such a distribution by computing the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then distributing the coins accordingly.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers \(k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n\).
   - It then calculates the product `m` of all multipliers, which is intended to be the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The list `c` is populated with values obtained by dividing `m` by each \(k_i\). This step is supposed to compute the LCM divided by each \(k_i\), but the actual implementation uses the GCD instead.
   - The GCD of the multipliers is computed using the function `func_1`.
   - The program then divides each element in `c` by the GCD to normalize the values.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the normalized values is less than or equal to the normalized LCM. If true, it prints the normalized values; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of the list of numbers.
   - However, the program uses this GCD instead of the LCM, which is incorrect.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem statement:
     ```
     3
     3 2 7
     2
     3 3
     5
     5 5 5 5 5
     ```
   - For the first test case, the program correctly outputs `27 41 12`.
   - For the second test case, the program incorrectly outputs `1 1` because it uses the GCD instead of the LCM.
   - The correct output should be `1 1`, but the program's logic is flawed due to the incorrect computation of the LCM.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly compute the LCM and instead uses the GCD, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
