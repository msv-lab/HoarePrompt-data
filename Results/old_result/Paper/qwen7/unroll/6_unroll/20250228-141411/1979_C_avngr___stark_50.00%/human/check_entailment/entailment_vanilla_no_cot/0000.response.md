Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`:**
   - The variable `m` is calculated as the product of all multipliers (`k_i`). However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum of the bets will be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. Instead, it should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD), but it should calculate the least common multiple (LCM) to ensure the bets are distributed correctly.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Checking and Printing Bets:**
   - The logic for checking if the sum of bets is less than the LCM value is flawed. It should compare the sum of the bets with the LCM value divided by the GCD, which is not correctly implemented.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate LCM of all k_i
    l = reduce(lcm, k)
    
    c = [l // ki for ki in k]
    
    if sum(c) >= l:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, c)))
```

This corrected version uses the `reduce` function from the `functools` module to compute the LCM of all `k_i`. It then distributes the bets evenly based on the LCM value and checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM value. If so, it prints the distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.
