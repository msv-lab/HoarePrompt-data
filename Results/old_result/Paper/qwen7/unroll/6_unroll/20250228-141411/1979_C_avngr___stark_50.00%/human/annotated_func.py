#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The list numbers contains n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i.

    hcf = numbers[0]

        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, `numbers` is a list containing n integers k_1, k_2, …, k_n such that 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for each i, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. After executing, the program state includes the GCD of the input list stored in the variable `hcf`.
