Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly distribute the coins as required for all potential cases. Specifically, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \(k_i\) and then divides this LCM by each \(k_i\) to get the bets. However, the program uses a function `func_1` which actually computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) instead of the LCM. This means the program is incorrectly calculating the bets.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
3
3 2 7
2
3 3
5
5 5 5 5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
27 41 12 
1 1 
-1
```

However, the program's output is:
```
27 41 12 
1 1 
-1
```

For the first test case, the program correctly outputs `27 41 12`. But for the second test case, the program incorrectly outputs `1 1` because it is using the GCD instead of the LCM. The correct output should be `1 1`, but the program's logic is flawed due to the incorrect computation of the LCM.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle the calculation of the LCM properly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
