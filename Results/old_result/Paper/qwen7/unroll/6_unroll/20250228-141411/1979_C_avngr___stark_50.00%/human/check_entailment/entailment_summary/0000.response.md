Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

2. **Key Logic in the Program**:
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`m = 1 * k[i]` for all `i`).
   - It then divides this product by each multiplier to get the initial distribution of coins (`c[i] = int(m / k[i])`).
   - The program then finds the GCD of these values using `func_1`.
   - It scales down the values in `c` by dividing each by the GCD.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the scaled-down values is less than the scaled-down product. If so, it prints the distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic to calculate the initial distribution of coins (`c[i] = int(m / k[i])`) is correct because it ensures that the total amount bet is maximized while keeping the individual bets as large as possible.
   - The GCD calculation is used to scale down the values to the smallest possible integers that still satisfy the condition, which is a valid approach.
   - The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` correctly identifies whether the total bet is less than the amount received for any winning outcome after scaling down.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1` if the sum of scaled-down values is not less than the scaled-down product.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find a valid distribution of coins or determine if no such distribution exists.

Correctness: **True**
