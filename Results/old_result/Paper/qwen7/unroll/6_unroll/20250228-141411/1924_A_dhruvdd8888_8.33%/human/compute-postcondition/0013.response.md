Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which is iterating over the set `us`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute for each element in the set `us`. Therefore, `i` will take on each value that is an element of `us`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over `us`, the initial value of `i` can be any element of `us`. However, since the loop will iterate over all elements of `us`, we don't need to specify an initial value for `i` but rather focus on the properties of `us`.

4. **Properties of `us`**: The set `us` contains the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the set `us`. The loop will execute as long as `us` is non-empty because the loop iterates over each element in `us`.

**State:**
- `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet (i.e., 'a' to the `k`th letter).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet**.
