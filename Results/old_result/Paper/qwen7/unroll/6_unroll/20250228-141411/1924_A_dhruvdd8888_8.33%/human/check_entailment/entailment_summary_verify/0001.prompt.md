You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least `n` sets of the first `k` unique lowercase English alphabets. If it finds at least `n` such sets, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' and then outputs a specific string based on the missing characters.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program starts by generating a random number `rrr` which is not used anywhere in the code.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` and a string `s`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - `func_1()` is defined but never called directly. Instead, it is called indirectly through the loop in the main part of the program.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - Inside `func_1()`, it initializes variables `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input.
   - It reads the string `s`.
   - It creates a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It initializes an empty set `win` to keep track of characters seen so far.
   - It iterates over each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in `us`, it adds it to `win`.
     - If `win` has `k` distinct characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the string `s`, it checks if `ps` (which should be the count of unique characters seen in `s`) is at least `n`.
   - If `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` using characters from `us` that were not in `win`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ps`**:
   - The variable `ps` is supposed to count the number of unique characters seen in `s` but is not actually used correctly. The logic should ensure that `ps` reflects the number of unique characters processed so far, but it is not being used effectively.

2. **Logic for Constructing `ans`**:
   - The construction of `ans` is flawed. The program tries to use characters from `us` that were not in `win`, but this does not guarantee that the constructed string `ans` will not be a subsequence of `s`. The logic here is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

3. **Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called in a loop, but the loop body is empty (`func_1()` is never called). This is a logical error and will cause the program to crash.

### Conclusion

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness: **False**
