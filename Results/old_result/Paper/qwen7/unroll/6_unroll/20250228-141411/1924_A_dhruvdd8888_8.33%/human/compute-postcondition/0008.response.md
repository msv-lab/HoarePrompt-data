Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user; `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet; `win` is a set that may contain up to `k` lowercase letters from the string `s`; `ans` is a list that contains the last `k` unique characters from `s` that are also in `us`, each repeated once for each time they were the `k`th unique character encountered; `ps` is an integer representing the number of times a set of `k` unique characters was fully collected from `s`.
