Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is a placeholder for an iterator) and the variable `cnt`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0. If `cnt` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `cnt` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`counter`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

4. **Formulate the Final State**: Based on the above analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `cnt`, which must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cnt` must be greater than 0**
