Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - It increments each element of `a` by its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`).
   - This part is correct because it follows the problem statement.

3. **Creating Set `S`:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each value in `a` and then converts `a` to a set.
   - However, this approach does not ensure that `S` is a set with unique elements as required by the problem. Instead, it should directly create a set from `a` after incrementing.

4. **Sorting the Set in Descending Order:**
   - The program sorts the set `a` in descending order.
   - This is correct as it follows the requirement to sort the elements of `S` in decreasing order.

5. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted set and constructs the array `b`.
   - It handles the case where there are repeated values by decrementing the count of the previous value appropriately.
   - This logic ensures that the constructed array `b` is lexicographically largest.

6. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - The program appends the last element of `b` repeatedly until the total length of `b` is `n`.
   - This ensures that the final array `b` has the correct length.

### Correctness Check

Given the analysis, the program does not strictly follow the problem's requirement of using a set `S` without duplicates. However, the logic to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints.

### Conclusion

Despite the minor discrepancy in how `S` is handled (using a `Counter` instead of a set), the overall logic to construct the lexicographically largest array `b` is correct.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **True**
