Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers and distributing the coins based on the LCM. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
2
3
5 5 5
3
6 3 2
```

- Expected Output:
```
-1
-1
```

However, the program will output:
```
125 125 125 
18 6 3 
```

For the first test case, the LCM of `[5, 5, 5]` is `5`. The program distributes `125` coins on each outcome, which is not strictly less than `5 * 125 = 625`.

For the second test case, the LCM of `[6, 3, 2]` is `6`. The program distributes `18`, `6`, and `3` coins respectively, which are not strictly less than `6 * 18 = 108`, `6 * 6 = 36`, and `6 * 3 = 18`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the requirement that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.
