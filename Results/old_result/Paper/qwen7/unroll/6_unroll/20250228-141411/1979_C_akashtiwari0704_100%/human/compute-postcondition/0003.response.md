Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `k` containing `n` integers (where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.**

Note: The actual processing logic is not described here as per the instructions.
