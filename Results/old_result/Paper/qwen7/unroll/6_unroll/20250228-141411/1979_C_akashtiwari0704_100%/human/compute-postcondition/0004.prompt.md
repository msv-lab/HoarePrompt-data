You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        def lcm(l):
            g = 1
            for i in range(len(l)):
                g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
            return g
        
        bets = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        prod = lcm(a)
        
        sumo = 0
        
        for i in range(bets):
            a[i] = prod // a[i]
            sumo += int(a[i])
        
        if sumo >= prod:
            print(-1)
        else:
            ans = ''
            for i in range(bets):
                ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state depends on the input values of `t`, `bets`, and the list `a`. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `T`), the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements in list `a`, then modifies the list by dividing the LCM by each element. It sums these modified values. If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the modified list elements separated by spaces. This process repeats `t` times. The final output will be the result of the last iteration of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `k` containing `n` integers (where 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). The function does not return a specific value but processes these inputs according to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
