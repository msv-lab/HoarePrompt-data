Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `k_i`.
3. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using the `lcm` function.
4. It then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the betting amounts.
5. It checks if the sum of these betting amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the betting amounts; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem statement. The steps taken ensure that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome, which is the requirement of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
