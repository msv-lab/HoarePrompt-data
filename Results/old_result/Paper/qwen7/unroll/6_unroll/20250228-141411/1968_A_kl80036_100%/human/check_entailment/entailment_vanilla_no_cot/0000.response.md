Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program is to simply subtract 1 from `x` to get `y`, but this does not guarantee that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) will be maximized. 

To maximize \(\gcd(x, y) + y\), we need to find a \(y\) such that \(\gcd(x, y)\) is as large as possible while still satisfying \(1 \leq y < x\). A better approach would be to check the divisors of \(x\) starting from the largest possible divisor less than \(x\) and see if it satisfies the condition.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(1, x):
            current_gcd = gcd(x, y)
            if current_gcd + y > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_gcd + y
                best_y = y
        print(best_y)

func()
```

This version iterates through all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\), calculates \(\gcd(x, y)\), and keeps track of the \(y\) that gives the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).
