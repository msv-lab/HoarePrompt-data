The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it determines whether the sequence \(a, b, c\) represents a 'STAIR' (if \(a < b < c\)), a 'PEAK' (if \(a < b > c\)), or neither ('NONE'). It outputs one of these labels for each test case. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the results directly to the console.
