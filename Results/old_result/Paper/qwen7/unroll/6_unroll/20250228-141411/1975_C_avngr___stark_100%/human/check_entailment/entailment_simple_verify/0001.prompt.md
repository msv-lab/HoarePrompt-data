You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue

            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an input integer, and for each iteration of the loop, given an integer n and a list of n integers, if n is 2, the minimum of the list is printed. Otherwise, a variable max is set to 0, and for each group of three consecutive numbers in the list (except the last two if n is not divisible by 3), the second smallest number is found and compared with max. The final max value is then printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Handling Small Arrays:**
   - The program checks if `n` is 2 and prints the minimum of the two elements directly. This is correct because for an array of length 2, the only way to make all elements equal is to set them both to the minimum value.

3. **Finding the Maximum Median:**
   - The program iterates through the array with a loop from `i = 0` to `n - 2`. This means it considers every possible subarray of length 3.
   - For each subarray of length 3, it sorts the subarray and takes the middle element (`temp[1]`) as the potential maximum median.
   - It updates the maximum value found so far (`max`).

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all subarrays, it prints the maximum value found.

### Issues and Corrections

1. **Subarray Length Consideration:**
   - The program only considers subarrays of length 3. However, according to the problem, Mocha can choose any subarray `[a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_r]` where `1 ≤ l < r ≤ n`.
   - This means the program should consider all possible subarrays, not just those of length 3.

2. **Updating Maximum Median:**
   - The program updates the maximum value only when the middle element of the sorted subarray is greater than the current maximum. This logic is correct but incomplete.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the entire array can be made uniform without needing to use any subarrays. For example, if the array is already uniform, the program might incorrectly return the middle element of a subarray instead of the actual maximum value.

### Corrected Approach

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Consider all possible subarrays of any length.
- Track the maximum value encountered during the process.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Track the maximum value seen so far
        max_value = max(a)
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
                subarray = a[i:j]
                median = subarray[len(subarray) // 2]
                if median > max_value:
                    max_value = median
        
        print(max_value)
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to its limited consideration of subarray lengths and incomplete handling of updating the maximum value. The corrected approach ensures that all subarrays are considered and the maximum value is accurately tracked.
