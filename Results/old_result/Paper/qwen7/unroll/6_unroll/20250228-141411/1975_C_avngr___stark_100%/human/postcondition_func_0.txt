The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n integers. For each test case, if n is 2, it prints the minimum of the two integers. Otherwise, it finds the second smallest number among every group of three consecutive numbers (excluding the last two if n is not divisible by 3) and prints the maximum of these second smallest numbers across all groups.
