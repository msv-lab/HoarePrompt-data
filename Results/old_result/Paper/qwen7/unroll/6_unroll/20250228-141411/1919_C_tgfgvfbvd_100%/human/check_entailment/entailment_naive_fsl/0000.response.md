Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The logic in the program seems to be attempting to find the minimum number of inversions (where an element is greater than the next element) by splitting the array into two subsequences, but it does not ensure that every element is included in either subsequence. Additionally, the logic for determining the penalty is flawed because it does not properly split the array into two subsequences that cover all elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `3`, which can be achieved by splitting the array into `[2, 4, 5]` and `[1, 3]`. However, the provided program does not guarantee this optimal split. Instead, it tries to minimize the number of inversions within a single subsequence, which is not the same as minimizing the sum of penalties for two subsequences.

A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two subsequences such that the penalty is minimized. This can be done by ensuring that the elements in one subsequence are non-decreasing and the elements in the other subsequence are also non-decreasing, while covering all elements of the original array.
