Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to minimize the total penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences `s` and `t` and calculating the penalty for each subsequence. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.

Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Penalty Calculation**: The solution attempts to calculate the penalty by maintaining two variables `a` and `b` and incrementing `c` whenever a new element is greater than both `a` and `b`. This logic does not correctly compute the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The logic for splitting the array into two subsequences is not implemented. The solution only processes the array once without considering how to optimally split it into two subsequences.

To correctly solve this problem, one approach is to sort the array and then use a greedy strategy to split the array into two subsequences such that the penalty is minimized. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        penalty = 0
        # Calculate the penalty for the first subsequence
        for i in range(1, n):
            if l[i] > l[i-1]:
                penalty += 1
        # The second subsequence will have no penalty if we take the rest of the elements
        print(penalty)

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the penalty for the first subsequence by counting the number of increasing pairs.
3. The second subsequence will inherently have no penalty because it will contain the remaining elements after the first subsequence.

This approach ensures that the penalty is minimized by optimally splitting the array.
