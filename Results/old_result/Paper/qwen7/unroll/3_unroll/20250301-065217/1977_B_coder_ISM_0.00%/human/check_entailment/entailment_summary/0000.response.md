Reasoning:
1. **Binary Representation**: The program correctly converts the integer \(x\) into a 30-bit binary representation.
2. **Modification Rules**:
   - The program attempts to modify the binary string to ensure no two consecutive non-zero digits exist. This is done by checking for consecutive '1's and converting one of them to '-1' and the other to '0'.
   - If the last bit is '0' after such conversions and a '1' is needed, it appends a '1' at the end, increasing the length.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the length of the array might need to be increased due to the modifications.
   - It ensures that the final array meets the requirement of having no two consecutive non-zero digits.
4. **Output Format**: The program outputs the length of the array followed by the array itself, which matches the required format.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described. It generates a valid array for each test case that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
