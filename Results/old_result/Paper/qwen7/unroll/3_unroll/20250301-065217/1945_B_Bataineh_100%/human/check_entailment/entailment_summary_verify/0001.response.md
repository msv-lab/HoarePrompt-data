### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It then checks different conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

3. **Conditions Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** `m < a and m < b`
     - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is 2. This is because the first and second installations will have their fireworks overlapping for at most 2 intervals within the visibility period of `m`.
   - **Case 2:** `m < a and m > b`
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `2 + m // b`. This accounts for the initial overlap of 2 fireworks plus the additional fireworks from the second installation.
   - **Case 3:** `m < b and m > a`
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `2 + m // a`. This accounts for the initial overlap of 2 fireworks plus the additional fireworks from the first installation.
   - **Case 4:** Otherwise
     - In all other cases, the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This formula accounts for the overlaps and additional fireworks from both installations.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in the code seems to handle the different scenarios correctly based on the conditions provided.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is derived from the observation that the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is the sum of the number of fireworks from each installation plus the initial overlap of 2 fireworks.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the basic cases correctly. However, we need to verify if the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is always correct.
   - When `a` and `b` are very close to each other, the formula should still work as long as `m` is not too small compared to `a` and `b`.

6. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the formula using the example provided in the problem statement:
     - For the input `6 7 4`:
       - `m = 4`, `a = 6`, `b = 7`.
       - `4 // 6 = 0` and `4 // 7 = 0`, so the formula gives `0 + 0 + 2 = 2`, which is correct.
     - For the input `3 4 10`:
       - `m = 10`, `a = 3`, `b = 4`.
       - `10 // 3 = 3` and `10 // 4 = 2`, so the formula gives `3 + 2 + 2 = 7`, which is correct.
     - For the input `7 8 56`:
       - `m = 56`, `a = 7`, `b = 8`.
       - `56 // 7 = 8` and `56 // 8 = 7`, so the formula gives `8 + 7 + 2 = 17`, which is correct.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code handles the problem correctly and the conditions are appropriately checked.
   - The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is correct and works for the given constraints.
