Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not provide a general solution for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of GCD**: The solution does not consider the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, which is crucial for determining the periodicity of when both installations will launch fireworks at the same time.

2. **Edge Cases Not Properly Handled**: The logic in the solution is overly simplistic and fails to account for scenarios where the GCD of `a` and `b` plays a significant role in determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at any given time.

3. **General Formula Missing**: A more accurate approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and then using it to determine how often both installations launch fireworks simultaneously within the visibility period `m`.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, you should use the following approach:

1. Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`.
2. Determine how many times both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period `m`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        max_visible = min(m // a, m // b) + 1  # Both installations launch at the same time
        max_visible += min(m // a, lcm_ab - 1)  # First installation launches before the next simultaneous launch
        max_visible += min(m // b, lcm_ab - 1)  # Second installation launches before the next simultaneous launch
        print(max_visible)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously by considering the periodicity of both installations and their simultaneous launches.
