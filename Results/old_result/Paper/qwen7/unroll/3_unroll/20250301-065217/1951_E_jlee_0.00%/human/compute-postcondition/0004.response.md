Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin characters where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6. The function returns a result based on the input `t` and `s`. If the sum of the lengths of all strings `s` across all test cases does not exceed 10^6, it processes each test case accordingly.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a string `s`. It processes these inputs according to specified conditions and returns results for each test case, ensuring the total length of all strings `s` does not exceed 10^6 characters.
