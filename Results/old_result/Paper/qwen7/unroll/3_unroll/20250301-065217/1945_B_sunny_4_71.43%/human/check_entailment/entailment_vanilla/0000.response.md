### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the intervals during which both installations launch fireworks within the visibility period `m`.

3. **Calculation:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes is `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - Similarly, for the second installation, the number of fireworks launched within `m` minutes is `int(m / b) + 1`.

4. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - The formula `A + B` calculates the total number of unique launches from both installations within the visibility period `m`. However, this does not account for potential overlaps where a firework from one installation might coincide with a firework from the other installation.

5. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct approach involves calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the interval at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously.
   - The number of simultaneous launches can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Simultaneous launches} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - The total number of fireworks visible at the same time is then:
     \[
     \text{Total visible} = \left( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1 \right) + \left( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 \right) - \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor
     \]

6. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The provided program calculates `A` and `B` but does not subtract the overlapping launches.
   - This results in an overestimation of the number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly account for the overlap between the launches from both installations, leading to an incorrect result.

**Correctness: False**
