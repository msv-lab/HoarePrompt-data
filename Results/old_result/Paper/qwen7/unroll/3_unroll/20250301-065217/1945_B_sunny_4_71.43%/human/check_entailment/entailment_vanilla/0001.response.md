### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the intervals during which fireworks from both installations overlap in visibility.
   - The key observation is that the number of fireworks visible from each installation over a period of `m` minutes is approximately `m / a` and `m / b`, respectively. Adding 1 accounts for the inclusion of the initial launch time.

3. **Calculation:**
   - For the first installation, the number of fireworks visible within `m` minutes is `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - For the second installation, the number of fireworks visible within `m` minutes is `int(m / b) + 1`.

4. **Overlap Consideration:**
   - The formula provided in the code directly sums these values without considering any overlap between the two installations. However, since the problem does not specify any specific constraints or overlaps beyond the visibility period, the provided solution is a reasonable approximation.

5. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks from each installation using the given formulas.
   - It sums these values and prints the result.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles large values of `a`, `b`, and `m` within the given constraints (1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18).
   - The logic is straightforward and does not require complex calculations or additional checks for overlap beyond the visibility period.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
