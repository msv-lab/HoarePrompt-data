Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers n and m, and lists a and b containing n positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final` by either swapping or passing, based on the costs provided in lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.**
