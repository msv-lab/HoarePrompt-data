Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through lists a and b, where each list contains n positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. For each test case defined by positive integers n and m (with 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and bounds 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it returns a result based on the values in lists a and b.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters through the lists `a` and `b`, along with `n` and `m`, and returns a result based on these inputs.
