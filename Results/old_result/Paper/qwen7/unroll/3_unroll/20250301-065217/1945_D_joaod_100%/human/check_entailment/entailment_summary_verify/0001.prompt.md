You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers n and m, and lists a and b containing n positive integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final` by either swapping or passing, based on the costs provided in lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. It then prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill.
   - It then reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts indices by subtracting 1 from `na_frente` and `pos_final` to make them zero-based.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `total` is initialized to 0.
   - `best` is set to a very large value (`sys.float_info.max`).

4. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from `na_frente` to 0 (inclusive).
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed final position (`v <= pos_final`):
       - It checks if the cost to swap with the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the cost to pass through the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`).
       - If swapping is cheaper, it updates `best` and adds `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` to `total`.
       - Otherwise, it adds `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.
     - If `v` is beyond the allowed final position:
       - It directly adds the cost to pass through the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_passar_b[v]`) to `total`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `best`, which is the minimum cost.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where `v` is within the allowed final position and beyond it.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound. It correctly chooses between swapping and passing based on the costs.

3. **Initialization and Final Value:**
   - The initial value of `best` is set to a very large value, ensuring that any valid cost will be lower.
   - The final value of `best` is correctly printed as the result.

4. **Loop Logic:**
   - The loop iterates correctly from `na_frente` to 0, considering all positions.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be correct and handles all the specified conditions and constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
