Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as the value of `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value meets the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` to ensure that the loop can proceed.

Given the constraints and the requirement to adjust only the states of objects in the loop head, the key variables are `i` and the input value, which is derived from `t`.

- `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
- The input value should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will run `t` times, and `t` is already given as a positive integer, we don't need to change `t` itself but rather ensure that the input value matches the expected range.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that the input value will be within the valid range and that `i` starts from 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
