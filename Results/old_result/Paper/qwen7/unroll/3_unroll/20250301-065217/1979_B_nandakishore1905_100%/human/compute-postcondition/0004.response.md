Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \(n\) and \(m\). For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference \(k = |n - m|\). Depending on the value of \(k\), it prints one of three possible values: \(k\) itself if it is a power of 2, 1 if \(k\) is odd, or the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(k\) if \(k\) is even but not a power of 2. The function does not return any value but outputs these results for each test case.**
