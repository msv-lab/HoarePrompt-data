Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.**

The code `t = int(input(''))` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer. This input is assigned to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 remains valid, but now `t` holds the specific value entered by the user. The other information about `n` and the cells containing chips is not affected by this line of code.
