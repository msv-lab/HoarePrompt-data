You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of the count of '0's in the substring of `arr` from the first occurrence of '1' to the character just before the last occurrence of '1' when read from right to left, for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the binary string), and a binary string representing cells where 1 indicates a cell with a chip and 0 indicates an empty cell. For each test case, the function finds the substring between the first and last occurrences of '1' (when read from left to right and right to left respectively) and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function then prints the count of '0's for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip positions but does not account for the actual minimum operations needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program output is `1`, which is correct for this specific case. However, consider another case:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```

The correct output should be `2` because we need to move the chip in the 3rd position to the 2nd position, and then move the chip in the 5th position to the 4th position. But the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

Another example:
```
6
0 1 0 0 0 0
```

The correct output should be `1` because we can move the chip in the 2nd position to the 1st position. But the program incorrectly outputs `0`.

These examples show that the program does not handle all cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
