Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the binary string), and a binary string representing cells where 1 indicates a cell with a chip and 0 indicates an empty cell. For each test case, the function finds the substring between the first and last occurrences of '1' (when read from left to right and right to left respectively) and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function then prints the count of '0's for each test case.**
