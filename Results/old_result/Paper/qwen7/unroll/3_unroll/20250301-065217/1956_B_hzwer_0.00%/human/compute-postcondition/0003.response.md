Output State: **`dp[n - 1][0]` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, the list `a` is updated to contain integers read from input, and `cards` is a list of these integers, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), where each element is initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `dp[n - 1][0]` to 0. All other variables and their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
