Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; the list `a` is updated to contain integers read from input, and `cards` is a list of these integers.**

Explanation: The code `cards = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `cards`. The variable `t` and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `n` remains the same as it was an input integer, but now `cards` holds the list of integers read from the input.
