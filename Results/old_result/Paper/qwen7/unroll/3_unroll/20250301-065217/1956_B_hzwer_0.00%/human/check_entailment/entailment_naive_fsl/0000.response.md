Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game as described. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` does not accurately model the optimal strategy for Nene. The program assumes that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, but the logic for this is flawed.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
1
```
- Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates that you can score 2 points, which is not possible if Nene plays optimally. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial State**: You have cards with numbers 1, 1, 2, and 3. Nene has cards with numbers 2, 3, 4, and 4.
2. **Turn 1**: You play a card with number 1. Nene plays a card with number 4. You score 0 points.
3. **Turn 2**: You play another card with number 1. Nene plays a card with number 4. You score 0 points.
4. **Turn 3**: You play a card with number 2. Nene plays a card with number 2. You score 1 point.
5. **Turn 4**: You play a card with number 3. Nene plays a card with number 3. You score 1 point.

Thus, the maximum number of points you can get is 1, not 2. The program fails to account for the optimal strategy of Nene correctly, leading to incorrect results.
