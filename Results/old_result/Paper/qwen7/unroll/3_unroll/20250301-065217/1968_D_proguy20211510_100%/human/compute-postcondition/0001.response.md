Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers of length n, MOD is 1000000007, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**

Explanation: The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The output state includes all the initial conditions and the new definition of `MOD`.
