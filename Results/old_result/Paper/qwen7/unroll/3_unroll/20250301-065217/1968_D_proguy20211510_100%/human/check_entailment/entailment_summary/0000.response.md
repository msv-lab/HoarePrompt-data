Reasoning:
1. The provided program aims to simulate the "Permutation game" for multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the necessary inputs: \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).
3. The program constructs two paths, one for Bodya and one for Sasha, by following the rules of the game.
4. It then calculates the maximum possible scores for both players by considering all possible sequences of moves up to \( k \) turns.
5. Finally, it compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**: The program constructs the paths using a loop that appends the current score to the path and updates the position. This approach does not correctly simulate the game because it does not account for the possibility of revisiting positions, which can affect the score calculation.
2. **Score Calculation Logic**: The score calculation logic is flawed. Instead of calculating the maximum possible score for \( k \) turns, it only considers the sum of the first \( k \) elements in the constructed path. This does not reflect the game's rules correctly.
3. **Input Handling**: The program uses `int(input().split())` to read multiple integers in a single line, which is incorrect. It should use `map(int, input().split())` instead.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the game's rules and logic.

Correctness: **False**
