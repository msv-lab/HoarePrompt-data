You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

If `resb` is greater than `ress`, "Bodya" will be printed; if `ress` is greater than `resb`, "Sasha" will be printed; otherwise, "Draw" will be printed. The specific values of `resb` and `ress` depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program initializes some constants (`YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, `alpha`).
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` (the lengths of the permutation, duration of the game, Bodya's starting position, and Sasha's starting position respectively).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Path Calculation for Bodya:**
   - A list `pathb` is initialized to store Bodya's scores.
   - A `vis` list is used to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - Starting from `pb - 1`, the program follows the permutation to calculate Bodya's scores until a cycle is detected.
   - The scores are stored in `pathb`.

3. **Path Calculation for Sasha:**
   - Similarly, a list `paths` is initialized to store Sasha's scores.
   - Another `vis` list is used to keep track of visited positions.
   - Starting from `ps - 1`, the program follows the permutation to calculate Sasha's scores until a cycle is detected.
   - The scores are stored in `paths`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - Two variables `resb` and `ress` are initialized to store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - The program iterates through the calculated paths to compute the maximum possible scores for each player.
   - For each player, it calculates the score considering up to `k` turns and updates the maximum score accordingly.

5. **Result Output:**
   - Based on the computed scores, the program determines the winner or if it's a draw and prints the result.

### Correctness Check

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input format and parses the necessary values.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The use of `vis` lists ensures that the program detects cycles and stops following the permutation once a cycle is detected, which is crucial for preventing infinite loops.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating the scores is correct. It considers the scores for each turn and updates the maximum score appropriately.

4. **Winner Determination:**
   - The program correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and outputs the appropriate result.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the rules of the game. There are no apparent errors in the code that would lead to incorrect results.

**Correctness: **True**
