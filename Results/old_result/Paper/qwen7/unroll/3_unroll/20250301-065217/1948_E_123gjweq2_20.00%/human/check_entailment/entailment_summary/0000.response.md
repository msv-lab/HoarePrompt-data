Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if the provided functions generate a valid solution for the problem statement. Let's break down the requirements and the functions' behavior:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to assign each vertex an integer from 1 to n such that all assigned integers are distinct.
   - For each pair of vertices (i, j), if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \), an edge is added between them.
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It calls `make_array` for each clique, setting elements in `arr` and `cliquess` based on the specified ranges and values.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.
   - The first part starts from `left` and increments by 1, while the second part starts from `right` and decrements by 1.

Let's analyze if the provided solution meets the requirements:

- **Distinct Assignments**: The assignment of integers from 1 to n ensures that all integers are distinct.
- **Edge Conditions**: The condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied within the constructed arrays because:
  - Elements in the first half of the range are increasing linearly.
  - Elements in the second half of the range are decreasing linearly.
  - The difference in indices and values will always satisfy the condition due to the way the values are assigned.
- **Clique Partition**: The construction of `arr` and `cliquess` ensures that vertices within the same segment of the range belong to the same clique, and vertices in different segments belong to different cliques.

Given this analysis, the provided functions correctly generate a valid solution that meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
