Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `not_mid`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`.
   - `right` is an integer.
   - `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier.
   - `small_element` is `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
   - `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.
   - `arr` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `small_element + i` for `i` in the range `0` to `mid - 1`.
   - `cliquess` is a list where elements from index `left` to `left + mid - 1` are set to `clique`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that `not_mid` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - Given `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`, we need to ensure that `right - left + 1 - mid > 0`.

5. **Final state**:
   - `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`.
   - `right` is an integer.
   - `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier.
   - `small_element` is `left + 1`.
   - `big_element` is `right + 1`.
   - `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.
   - `not_mid` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `right - left + 1 - mid > 0`).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `right - left + 1 - mid > 0`)**.
