Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Name**: The function `func_1` is defined but not called within the main execution block. It should be called to process the input and generate the output.

2. **Incomplete Implementation**: The function `make_array` is defined but not used in the main logic. The variable `cliquess` is declared but never used in the main function `func_1`.

3. **Logic Errors**:
   - The `make_array` function does not properly fill the array `arr` and the `cliquess` list according to the problem statement.
   - The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` is flawed. Specifically, the assignment of elements to different cliques is not done correctly based on the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

4. **Missing Input Handling**: The program does not read the input values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. It assumes these values are predefined, which is not the case for general input handling.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    # Calculate the number of cliques needed
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    
    # Initialize arrays
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    
    # Assign values to arr and cliquess
    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = i + 1
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1
    
    # Print the results
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Read input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
index = 1

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1])
    index += 2
    func_1(n, k)
```

This corrected version reads the input correctly and implements the logic to assign values to `arr` and `cliquess` such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques.
