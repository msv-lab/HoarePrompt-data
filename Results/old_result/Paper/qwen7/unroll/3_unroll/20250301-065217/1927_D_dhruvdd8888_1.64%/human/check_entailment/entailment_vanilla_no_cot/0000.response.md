Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` is incomplete**: The function `func_1` is defined but never called properly within the loop that processes each test case. It should be called inside the loop to handle each test case.

2. **Incorrect handling of queries**: The logic for handling queries is flawed. Specifically, the use of binary search (`bisect_left`) and the way indices are processed do not correctly identify pairs of different elements within the queried range.

3. **Edge cases not handled properly**: The code does not handle edge cases where the queried range might not contain any valid pairs of different elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())

for ppp in range(tc):
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    Q = int(input())
    
    # Preprocess the array to find segments of consecutive equal numbers
    arr = []
    s = 0
    for i in range(N):
        if i == N-1 or nums[i] != nums[i+1]:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, nums[i]))
            s = i + 1
    
    # Process each query
    for _ in range(Q):
        (l, r) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        (s, e, num) = arr[min(eli, len(arr)-1)]
        
        if s > l:
            if s == 1:
                print(-1, -1)
            else:
                print(s - 1, s)
        elif e >= r:
            print(-1, -1)
        elif e < N:
            print(s, e + 1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
    
    if ppp < tc - 1:
        print()  # Print a newline between test cases
```

This corrected version ensures that:
- The preprocessing step correctly identifies segments of consecutive equal numbers.
- Each query is processed correctly using binary search to find the appropriate segment.
- Proper handling of edge cases and invalid queries.
