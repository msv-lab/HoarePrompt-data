Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify pairs of different elements within the specified query range for certain inputs.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

- Actual Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
2 3
```

The issue arises because the program uses a binary search approach to find the first differing element within the query range. However, this approach does not guarantee finding the correct pair of different elements. For instance, in the query `1 3`, the program incorrectly returns `2 3` instead of `-1 -1` since there are no different elements in the range `[1, 3]`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly identifies the presence of different elements within the query range and returns the appropriate indices. A more robust solution would involve checking each element within the query range directly to find a pair of different elements.
