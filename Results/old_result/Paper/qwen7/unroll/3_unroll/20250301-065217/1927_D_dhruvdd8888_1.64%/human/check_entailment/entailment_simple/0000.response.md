### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of different elements within a specified subarray for multiple queries. The solution needs to handle multiple test cases and queries efficiently.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the array `nums` and the number of queries (`q`).
   - It then processes each query by finding a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i â‰  a_j` within the specified range `[l, r]`.
   - The key part of the program is the preprocessing step where it identifies segments of consecutive identical elements in the array `nums`.

3. **Preprocessing Step**:
   - The preprocessing step creates a list `arr` that stores the start and end indices of segments of consecutive identical elements in `nums`.
   - This helps in quickly determining the presence of different elements within any given range `[l, r]`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment in `arr` that overlaps with the query range `[l, r]`.
   - Based on the segment found, it determines whether there are different elements within the range `[l, r]` and prints the appropriate indices or `(-1, -1)` if no such pair exists.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when the segment starts before `l` or ends after `r`.
   - It also correctly handles cases where the segment is completely within the range `[l, r]`.

6. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the results for each query as required, ensuring that the format is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It preprocesses the array to identify segments of consecutive identical elements and then efficiently processes each query using these segments. The code handles all specified requirements and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:

**True**
