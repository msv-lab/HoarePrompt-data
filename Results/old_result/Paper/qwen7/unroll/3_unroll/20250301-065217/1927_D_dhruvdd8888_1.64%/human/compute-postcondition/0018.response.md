Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on a list of integers. It first identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the input list and stores their start and end indices along with the number itself. Then, for each query, it determines the segment within the identified segments that overlaps with the query range and prints the start and end indices of that segment. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
