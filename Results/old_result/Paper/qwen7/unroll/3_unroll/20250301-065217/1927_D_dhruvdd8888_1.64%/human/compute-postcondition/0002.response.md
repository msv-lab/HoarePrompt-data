Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a remains unchanged, and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; nums is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]**.

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged. The variable `N` mentioned in the code snippet is not present in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a typo or an unused variable.
