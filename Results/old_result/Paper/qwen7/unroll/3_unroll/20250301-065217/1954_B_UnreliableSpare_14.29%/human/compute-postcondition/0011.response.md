Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to 0.**

Explanation: The given code snippet updates the variable `ans` by setting it to the minimum value between its current value (`ans`) and the value of `cnt`. Initially, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is also 0. The loop iterates through the array `arr`, comparing each element with `val` (which is `arr[0]`). 

- If an element matches `arr[0]`, `cnt` is incremented, but since the loop does not contain any such matching condition, `cnt` remains 0.
- If an element does not match `arr[0]`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. Since `cnt` is always 0, `ans` remains 0.

Therefore, after executing the code, the values of the variables remain unchanged except for `ans`, which remains 0.
