Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function processes these inputs to determine some property or perform some operation on the array a, and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and an array `a`. It processes these inputs according to the specified constraints and returns a result based on the properties of the array `a`.
