Based on the initial state provided:

- `flag` is `False`
- `t` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement)
- `n` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement)
- `arr` remains unchanged (though its value is not relevant to the print statement)
- `val` is equal to `arr[0]`
- `cnt` is `0`
- `ans` is equal to `0`

The print statement is `print(ans)`, which will print the value of `ans`.

Output: **0**
