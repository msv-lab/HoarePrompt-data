Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and arr is a list of n integers obtained from the input split and converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is updated to the value of the input integer that was used to create the list `arr`.
