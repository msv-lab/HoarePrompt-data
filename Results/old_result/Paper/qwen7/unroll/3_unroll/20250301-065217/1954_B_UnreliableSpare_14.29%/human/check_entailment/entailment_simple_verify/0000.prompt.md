You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The given array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is False, t remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: `flag` is False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through the array `arr`. Since the initial value of `val` is set to `arr[0]`, the loop compares each element of `arr` with `arr[0]`. If an element matches `arr[0]`, `cnt` is incremented; otherwise, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`. However, since `cnt` starts at 0 and is only incremented when elements match `arr[0]`, and there is no decrement or reset of `cnt` within the loop, `cnt` will always be 0 unless there are multiple consecutive matching elements, which would then update `ans` to 1 (since `cnt` would reach 1 before being reset). Given the initial conditions and the lack of any resetting mechanism for `cnt`, `cnt` remains 0 throughout the loop, and `ans` is set to 0 if there are no matching elements.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: `flag` remains False, `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `val` is equal to `arr[0]`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is equal to 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle arrays where removing elements is necessary to break the beauty condition.

Consider the following test case:
```
6
3
1 2 1
```

The expected output for this case is `1`, because we can remove the element at index 2 (value 1), making the array `[1, 2]` which is not beautiful anymore.

However, the current implementation of the program does not detect this scenario. It checks if all elements are the same and if they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and outputs that as the result. This approach does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing a single element.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing a single element, rather than just checking if all elements are identical.
