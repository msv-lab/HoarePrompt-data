Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of the two arguments `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used anywhere in the program, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes no arguments but reads `x` and `y` from standard input.
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all icons.
   - The logic in `func_2` is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates:
       - `bxsfory`: The number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the largest possible number of 1x1 icons.
       - Adjusts `x` accordingly.
       - Calculates `bxsfory1`: The number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
       - Prints the total number of screens required.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it directly prints the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.
   - It calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Testing the Logic

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example test cases provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - `y = 1`, which means 1 2x2 icon.
  - The minimum number of screens needed is 1.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
  - `y = 2`, which means 2 2x2 icons.
  - 2 2x2 icons need 1 screen.
  - Remaining 7 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 7 / 15 ≈ 0.47, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
  - `y = 4`, which means 4 2x2 icons.
  - 4 2x2 icons need 2 screens.
  - Remaining 12 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 12 / 15 ≈ 0.8, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 2 + 1 = 3.
  - Output: 3 (Incorrect, should be 2).

- **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
  - `y = 3`, which means 3 2x2 icons.
  - 3 2x2 icons need 2 screens.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
  - `x = 1`, which means 1 1x1 icon.
  - 1 1x1 icon needs 1 screen.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
  - `y = 1`, which means 1 2x2 icon.
  - 1 2x2 icon needs 1 screen.
  - Remaining 8 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 8 / 15 ≈ 0.53, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
  - No icons, so 0 screens.
  - Output: 0 (Correct).

- **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
  - `x = 2`, which means 2 1x1 icons.
  - 2 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 2 / 15 ≈ 0.13, we round up to 1).
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
  - `x = 15`, which means 15 1x1 icons.
  - 15 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 15 / 15 = 1).
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
  - `y = 2`, which means 2 2x2 icons.
  - 2 2x2 icons need 1 screen.
  - Remaining 8 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 8 / 15 ≈ 0.53, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
  - `y = 9`, which means 9 2x2 icons.
  - 9 2x2 icons need 5 screens (since 9 / 2 = 4.5, we round up to 5).
  - Output: 5 (Correct).

### Conclusion

After testing the logic with the provided examples, we can see that the program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for some cases. Specifically, Test Case 3 is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
