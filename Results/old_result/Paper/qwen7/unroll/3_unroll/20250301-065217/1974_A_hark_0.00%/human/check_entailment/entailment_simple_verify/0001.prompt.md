You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of the two arguments `a` and `b`.
   - It is not used anywhere in the program, so we can ignore it for now.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes no arguments but reads `x` and `y` from standard input.
   - It calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all icons.
   - The logic in `func_2` is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates:
       - `bxsfory`: The number of full 2x2 icons that can fit into the remaining space after placing the largest possible number of 1x1 icons.
       - Adjusts `x` accordingly.
       - Calculates `bxsfory1`: The number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
       - Prints the total number of screens required.
     - If only `y` is greater than 0, it directly prints the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If only `x` is greater than 0, it prints the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using `func_2`.
   - It calls `func_2` for each test case.

### Testing the Logic

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example test cases provided:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - `y = 1`, which means 1 2x2 icon.
  - The minimum number of screens needed is 1.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
  - `y = 2`, which means 2 2x2 icons.
  - 2 2x2 icons need 1 screen.
  - Remaining 7 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 7 / 15 ≈ 0.47, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
  - `y = 4`, which means 4 2x2 icons.
  - 4 2x2 icons need 2 screens.
  - Remaining 12 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 12 / 15 ≈ 0.8, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 2 + 1 = 3.
  - Output: 3 (Incorrect, should be 2).

- **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
  - `y = 3`, which means 3 2x2 icons.
  - 3 2x2 icons need 2 screens.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
  - `x = 1`, which means 1 1x1 icon.
  - 1 1x1 icon needs 1 screen.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
  - `y = 1`, which means 1 2x2 icon.
  - 1 2x2 icon needs 1 screen.
  - Remaining 8 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 8 / 15 ≈ 0.53, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
  - No icons, so 0 screens.
  - Output: 0 (Correct).

- **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
  - `x = 2`, which means 2 1x1 icons.
  - 2 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 2 / 15 ≈ 0.13, we round up to 1).
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
  - `x = 15`, which means 15 1x1 icons.
  - 15 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 15 / 15 = 1).
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
  - `y = 2`, which means 2 2x2 icons.
  - 2 2x2 icons need 1 screen.
  - Remaining 8 1x1 icons need 1 screen (since 8 / 15 ≈ 0.53, we round up to 1).
  - Total screens: 1 + 1 = 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
  - `y = 9`, which means 9 2x2 icons.
  - 9 2x2 icons need 5 screens (since 9 / 2 = 4.5, we round up to 5).
  - Output: 5 (Correct).

### Conclusion

After testing the logic with the provided examples, we can see that the program does not correctly calculate the number of screens needed for some cases. Specifically, Test Case 3 is incorrect.
