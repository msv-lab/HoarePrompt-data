Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, where `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 × 1 icon and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 × 2 icon. The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function processes `t` test cases, each involving counts of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, but no specific return value is described other than the parameters it accepts.
