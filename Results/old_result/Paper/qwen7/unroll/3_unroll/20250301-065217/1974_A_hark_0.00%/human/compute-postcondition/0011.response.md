Output: **math.ceil(x / 15)**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, `x` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, and `y` is a non-negative integer equal to 0. The `print` statement calculates the ceiling of `x` divided by 15. Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we represent the result as `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
