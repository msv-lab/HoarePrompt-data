Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the total number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons combined.**

Given that the function does not accept any parameters but rather uses predefined variables `x` and `y` (where `x` is the number of 1 × 1 icons and `y` is the number of 2 × 2 icons), the functionality involves calculating and returning the sum of these two values. However, since the parameters themselves are not passed to the function, the description focuses on the expected input context and the output, which is the total count of icons.
