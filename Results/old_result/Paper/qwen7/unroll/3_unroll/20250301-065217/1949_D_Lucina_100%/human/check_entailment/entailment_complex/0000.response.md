Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly processes the input by counting the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario and storing these counts in the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Decision Making**: The program makes decisions about the undecided '?' values based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' in the surrounding cells. Specifically, it decides whether to use 'F' or 'S' for each undecided cell based on the majority of the surrounding decisions. This logic is consistent with the problem statement.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases where the number of undecided cells is greater for one type (either 'F' or 'S') by ensuring that the majority type is used for the undecided cells. This ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type can occur for any permutation of scenarios.

4. **Output Construction**: The program constructs the final output grid by iterating through each cell and deciding its value based on the surrounding cells and the majority rule. The output is formatted correctly as required.

Given the problem constraints and the provided annotated program, the program correctly implements the logic to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type can occur for any permutation of scenarios. The program also handles the undecided cells appropriately and maintains the required constraints.

Correctness: **True**
