Output State: **`a` is a list of length `n + 1`, all elements of which are 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1`, all elements of which are 0; `xx` is a list containing an empty string.**

Explanation: The code assigns an empty string to the variable `xx`. This does not affect the lists `a` and `b`, which remain unchanged. Therefore, the lengths and contents of `a` and `b` stay the same, and `xx` now contains a single element, an empty string.
