Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by determining the type of transition video (funny or scary) for each undecided position ('?') based on the surrounding cells. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Cells**: The program tries to decide the type of transition video for undecided cells based on the majority of surrounding decisions. This approach is flawed because it doesn't ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will appear for any permutation of scenarios. 

2. **Incorrect Logic for Deciding Video Types**: The logic used to decide the type of transition video for undecided cells is overly simplistic and does not consider the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. Specifically, the program does not account for the requirement that the solution must work for any permutation of scenarios.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program does not fully implement the necessary logic to ensure that the solution works for all permutations of scenarios. The provided logic only considers a subset of scenarios and does not handle the complexity of ensuring the constraint for all possible permutations.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
