You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, each containing n characters representing the partial transition video plan between scenarios. Characters can be F (funny), S (scary), ?, or . (no transition video needed). It is guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, and all other characters are undecided (?).

If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it appends that character. Otherwise, it appends 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, and 'S' otherwise.

The length of `sb` is now equal to or greater than the length of `sa`. After the loop executes, each string `nx` is constructed based on the rules provided within the loop body, with no changes to `sa` or `sb` lists.
    #State: `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sb` is now equal to or greater than the length of `sa`. `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `xx` remains an unchanged list of `n` input strings. For each `i` in the range 1 to `n`, `nx[i-1]` is constructed based on the following rules: if `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `nx[i-1]` is built by appending characters from `xx[i]` or appending 'F' or 'S' based on whether `i` or `j` (for all `j` from 1 to `n`) is in the first quarter of `sa`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it appends that character. Otherwise, it appends 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, and 'S' otherwise. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, `nx[i-1]` is constructed based on the same rules as described above.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string indicating the type of transition video needed for each undecided position in the n x n grid, where n is an integer between 2 and 24. If a position is already decided (F or S), it returns the corresponding character. For undecided positions (?), it determines whether a funny (F) or scary (S) video is needed based on the surrounding cells.
