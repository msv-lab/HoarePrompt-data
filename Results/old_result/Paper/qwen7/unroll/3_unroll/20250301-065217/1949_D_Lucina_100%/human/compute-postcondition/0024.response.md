Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to 1 and iterates up to `n + 1`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and `n` is a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Given the initial state of `sa` and `sb` as lists based on conditions involving `a` and `b`, these lists will be modified within the loop but do not affect the initial state required for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0**
