Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Counting and Logic for Transition Videos**:
   - The logic for counting the number of `F` and `S` videos (`a` and `b`) is flawed. It increments the counts for both `a` and `b` when a `F` or `S` is encountered, which is incorrect because `a` should count `F` transitions and `b` should count `S` transitions. This mistake leads to incorrect values for `a` and `b`.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Videos**:
   - The logic for deciding whether to set an undecided video (`?`) as `F` or `S` is also incorrect. The current implementation tries to place `F` or `S` based on a fixed rule (`i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), which does not ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

3. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The code does not fully implement the logic required to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear in any permutation of the scenarios. The current logic only partially addresses the problem and does not handle all edge cases.

4. **Incorrect Output Format**:
   - The output format is not consistent with the problem requirements. The code generates strings instead of lists of characters, which would require additional conversion steps.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm that ensures the constraints are met for any permutation of the scenarios. This might involve using graph theory or dynamic programming techniques to find a valid assignment of `F` and `S` to the undecided videos while respecting the constraints.
