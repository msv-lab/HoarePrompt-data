Output State: **nx is a list of strings where each string is constructed based on the conditions given in the loop. For each `i` in the range 1 to `n`, `nx[i-1]` is built by either appending characters from `xx[i]` or appending 'F' or 'S' based on whether `i` or `j` (for all `j` from 1 to `n`) is in the first quarter of `sa`. If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it appends that character. Otherwise, it appends 'F' if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, and 'S' otherwise.**
