Output State: `sa` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `sb` is a list containing indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where `b[i] == 0` and `a[i] == 0`, plus all indices `i` from 1 to `n+1` where both `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`. `a` and `b` remain unchanged, `xx` remains an unchanged list of `n` input strings. The length of `sb` is now equal to or greater than the length of `sa`.
