Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`. The loop will iterate from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be `1`.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Therefore, `n` must be a non-negative integer (since `n + 1` must be a positive integer).

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`sa`, `a`, `b`, `xx`, `sb`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop head.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a non-negative integer**
