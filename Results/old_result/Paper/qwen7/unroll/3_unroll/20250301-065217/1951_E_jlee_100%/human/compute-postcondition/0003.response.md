Output State: The value of `t` is reduced to 0, and no changes are made to the input integer `t`. For each iteration of the loop, based on the conditions provided in the loop body, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed along with some additional information, and the loop continues to the next iteration until `t` reaches 0. The final state of `t` is 0, and the output consists of the printed results from each iteration.
