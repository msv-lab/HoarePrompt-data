Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The code correctly handles single character strings by printing "NO". However, the logic is overly complex and can be simplified.

2. **Partitioning Logic**: The partitioning logic is flawed. It tries to find a non-palindromic substring by comparing characters from both ends, which is not always sufficient. For example, it fails to handle cases like `aabb` correctly.

3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly, such as strings with repeated characters in the middle, which can still be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

4. **Complexity**: The current implementation is overly complex and inefficient. It attempts to find a valid partition by checking various conditions, which is not necessary and leads to incorrect results.

### Correct Solution:
A simpler and more efficient approach would be to check if the string can be split into non-palindromic substrings by ensuring that at least one character appears only once in the string. If such a character exists, we can use it to split the string into non-palindromic parts.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if there is a character that appears exactly once
        char_count = {}
        for char in string:
            if char in char_count:
                char_count[char] += 1
            else:
                char_count[char] = 1
        
        single_char = None
        for char, count in char_count.items():
            if count == 1:
                single_char = char
                break
        
        if single_char is not None:
            # Find the position of the single character
            pos = string.index(single_char)
            left_part = string[:pos]
            right_part = string[pos+1:]
            
            # Check if both parts are non-palindromic
            if not is_palindrome(left_part) and not is_palindrome(right_part):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(left_part, right_part)
                continue
        
        print('NO')

def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution checks if there is a character that appears exactly once in the string. If such a character exists, it splits the string at that character and checks if both resulting parts are non-palindromic. This approach is simpler and more efficient.
