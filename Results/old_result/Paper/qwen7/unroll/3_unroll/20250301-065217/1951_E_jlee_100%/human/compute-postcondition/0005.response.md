Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. After processing all test cases, the function ensures that the counter `t` is reduced to 0, and the output consists of the printed results for each test case.**
