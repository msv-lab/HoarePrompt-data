The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and each integer in `arr` (denoted as `a_i`) satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. Based on the elements in `arr`, the function returns either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the values within the list.
