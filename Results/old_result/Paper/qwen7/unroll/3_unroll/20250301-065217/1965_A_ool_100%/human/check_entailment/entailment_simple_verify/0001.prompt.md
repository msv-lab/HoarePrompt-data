You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

Output

    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into the array `arr`.

2. **Calling the Function**:
   - The program calls `func_1(arr)` to determine the winner for each test case.
   - This function is supposed to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Step 1**: Convert the array to a set and sort it.
     ```python
     set_ = list(set(arr))
     set_.sort()
     ```
     - This step removes duplicates and sorts the unique values in ascending order.

   - **Step 2**: Check if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone.
     ```python
     if set_[0] != 1:
         return 'Alice'
     ```
     - If the smallest pile has more than 1 stone, Alice can immediately reduce all piles to 1 stone, making the smallest pile 1. Since the smallest pile is now 1, the next player (Bob) cannot make a move that keeps all piles non-empty, so Alice wins.

   - **Step 3**: Check if the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted set is exactly 1.
     ```python
     not_c = True
     for i in range(1, len(set_)):
         if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
             not_c = False
             break
     ```
     - If any two consecutive elements have a difference greater than 1, it means there is a gap, and the current configuration is not optimal for Alice to win immediately.

   - **Step 4**: Determine the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest value.
     ```python
     A = not A
     if not_c:
         A = not A
     return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
     ```
     - The variable `A` toggles between `True` and `False` based on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest value.
     - If `not_c` is `True`, it toggles `A` again.
     - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise 'Bob'.

### Correctness Check

1. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - The logic for checking if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone is correct and ensures Alice wins immediately in such cases.

2. **Gap Check**:
   - The logic for checking if there is a gap in the sequence of piles is correct. If there is a gap, Bob can force Alice into a losing position.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the number of piles with the smallest value is correct. This is derived from the Sprague-Grundy theorem for Nim games, where the XOR of the Grundy numbers of the piles determines the winner.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the rules of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
