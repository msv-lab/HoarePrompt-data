Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the deletion step where the indices of all elements to the right of \(a_i\) decrease by 1 after deleting \(a_i\). This means that the program does not simulate the correct transformation of the array \(a\) during the operations. As a result, the set \(S\) and the final array \(b\) will not be constructed as required by the problem description.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
6 4 8
```

The program will not correctly adjust the indices of the remaining elements in the array after each deletion. Therefore, the set \(S\) and the final array \(b\) will not be lexicographically maximal as required.
