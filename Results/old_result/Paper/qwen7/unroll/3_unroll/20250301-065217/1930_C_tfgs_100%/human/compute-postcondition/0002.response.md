Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should start from 0 and increment until it reaches `n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` must be initialized to 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - `n` must be within its valid range, i.e., \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, it does not need to be adjusted. The list `a` is not part of the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 1 and \(3 \cdot 10^5\)**
