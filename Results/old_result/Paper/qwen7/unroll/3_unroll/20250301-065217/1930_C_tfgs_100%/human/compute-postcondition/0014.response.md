Output State: `ans` is a list containing all elements of the original `a` list followed by additional elements generated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, with each element decremented by 1 for every iteration of the loop. `cur` remains the sum of `counter[a[i]]` for all elements in `a`. `cnt` is equal to the number of iterations the loop executed, which is the value of `ans` length minus the length of the original `a` list. `t` remains unchanged.
