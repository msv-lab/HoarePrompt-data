Output State: **counter is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers where each element a[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by (i + 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cur` is the sum of `counter[a[i]]` for all elements in `a`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` followed by additional elements generated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.**
