Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list where each element a[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by (i + 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is n - len(a), `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ans`. No other changes are made to the existing variables. Therefore, the values of `counter`, `a`, `t`, `n`, `cur`, and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
