Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers from the original list where each element a[i] (for 0 ≤ i < n) is increased by (i + 1), `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. The sorting operation does not change the values of `counter`, `t`, `n`, or `cur`. Therefore, these variables remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `a` is now sorted in reverse order.
