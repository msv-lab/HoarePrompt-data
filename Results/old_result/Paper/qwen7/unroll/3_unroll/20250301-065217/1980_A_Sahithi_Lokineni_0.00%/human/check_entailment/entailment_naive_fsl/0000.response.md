Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of additional problems needed. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the value of `ans` for each character in the dictionary `d`. It should only increment `ans` for characters that do not meet the requirement of having at least `m` occurrences. However, the current implementation increments `ans` for each character that has fewer than `m` occurrences, which leads to an overestimation of the required additional problems.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
The correct output should be `2` because we need one problem of difficulty 'A' and one problem of difficulty 'F'. However, the program outputs `7`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should check if the count of each character is less than `m` and then add the difference to `ans`. Here is the corrected version:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed.
