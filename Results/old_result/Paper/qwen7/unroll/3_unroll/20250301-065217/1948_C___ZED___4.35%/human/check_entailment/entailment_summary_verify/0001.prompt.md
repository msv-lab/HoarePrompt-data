You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is even), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if a path exists from the top row to the bottom row following the direction of the arrows. If a valid path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads input values for the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the two strings. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for each case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`, the first row of the grid (`a`), and the second row of the grid (`b`).

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `b[-2] != '>'`, the program immediately prints 'NO'. This check ensures that the last two cells in the second row cannot both point to the left, which would prevent reaching the last column.
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints 'YES'. This is a special case where the robot only needs to move down to reach the target cell `(2, 1)`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - A variable `no_path` is set to `True` initially.
   - The program iterates through the second row (`b`) in steps of 2, checking if the arrow points to the right (`>`). If any arrow does not point to the right, `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - Another loop iterates through the first row (`a`) in steps of 2, checking if the arrow points to the right (`>`). If any arrow does not point to the right, `no_path` is set to `False`.
   - After these checks, if `no_path` is still `True`, the program prints 'YES', indicating a path exists. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing 'YES'.
   - However, it should also handle the case when `n == 2` separately, as the initial check `if b[-2] != '>'` will fail but the robot can still reach the target.

2. **Logic Flaw:**
   - The logic for determining if a path exists is flawed. The program assumes that if any arrow does not point to the right, no path exists. This is not always true. For example, consider the grid:
     ```
     >>
     <>
     ```
     Here, `b[-2] == '<'`, so the program would incorrectly print 'NO'. However, the robot can still reach the target by moving down from `(1, 2)` to `(2, 2)`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the robot can move back and forth between the rows, potentially reaching the target cell.

### Corrected Approach:
A more robust approach would involve simulating the robot's movement and checking if it can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to handle certain edge cases and has a flawed logic for determining if a path exists.

**Correctness: **False**
