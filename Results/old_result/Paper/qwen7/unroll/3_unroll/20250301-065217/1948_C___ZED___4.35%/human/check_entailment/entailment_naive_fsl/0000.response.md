Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to consider the movement of the robot in both rows and the direction of the arrows in a comprehensive manner.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the following input:
```
4
6
<>><><
><<>><
```

According to the problem description, the robot starts at (1, 1) and needs to reach (2, 6). In this case, the robot can follow the path:
- Start at (1, 1) and move right to (1, 2).
- Move according to the arrow to (2, 2).
- Move right to (2, 3).
- Move according to the arrow to (1, 3).
- Move right to (1, 4).
- Move according to the arrow to (2, 4).
- Move right to (2, 5).
- Move according to the arrow to (1, 5).
- Move right to (1, 6).
- Move according to the arrow to (2, 6).

However, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' for this case because it only checks if the last character in the second row is '>' and if `n` is 1. Since `n` is not 1, it proceeds to check the conditions for even and odd indices, but it does not correctly handle the sequence of moves and directions.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) for all potential cases.
