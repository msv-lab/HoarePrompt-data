Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function returns a value based on the relationship between these two strings.**

Note: The actual logic to determine the return value based on the input strings is not described here as per the given instruction.
