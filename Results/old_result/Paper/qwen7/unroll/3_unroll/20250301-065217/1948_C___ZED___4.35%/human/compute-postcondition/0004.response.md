Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is even), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks if a path exists from the top row to the bottom row following the direction of the arrows. If a valid path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads input values for the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the two strings. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for each case.**
