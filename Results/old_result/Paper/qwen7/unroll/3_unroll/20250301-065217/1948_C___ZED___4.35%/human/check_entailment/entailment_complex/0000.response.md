Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the two strings representing the arrows in the grid.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program checks if `b[-2] != '>'`, which is a valid condition to quickly determine if the last column cannot be reached, thus printing 'NO'.
   - It also checks if `n == 1`, which is a special case but is handled correctly by printing 'YES'.

3. **Path Validation**:
   - The program iterates through the columns in steps of 2, checking if the arrow in the bottom row (`b`) points right (`>`). If it finds any column where `b[k] != '>',` it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Then, it iterates through the odd-indexed columns, checking if the arrow in the top row (`a`) points right (`>`). If it finds any column where `a[k] != '>',` it sets `no_path` to `False`.

4. **Output Determination**:
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after both loops, it prints 'YES', indicating a valid path exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO', indicating no valid path exists.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
