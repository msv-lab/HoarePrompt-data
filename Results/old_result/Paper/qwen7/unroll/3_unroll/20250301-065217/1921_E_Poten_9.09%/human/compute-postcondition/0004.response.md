Output State: `answers` is a list containing strings ('Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice') based on the conditions evaluated for each set of input provided by the user during the loop iterations. The length of the list is equal to the value of `test_cases`, which is an integer input from the user within the range 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4. Each element in the list corresponds to the result ('Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice') of the evaluation for each test case.
