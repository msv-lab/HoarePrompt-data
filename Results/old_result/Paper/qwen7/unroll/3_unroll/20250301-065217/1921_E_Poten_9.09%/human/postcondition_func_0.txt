The function reads multiple test cases from the user, where each test case consists of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). Based on specific conditions involving these integers, it determines whether Alice, Bob, or a Draw occurs for each test case. The results are stored in a list named `answers`. Finally, the function prints each result in the `answers` list, one per line.
