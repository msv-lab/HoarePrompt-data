Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized with the full product of the array before any operations. However, this product can be very large, potentially causing overflow. It should be updated incrementally within the loop.
   
2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `ans % m % MOD` is unnecessary and incorrect. It should just be `ans % m`.

3. **Handling of Array Length Reduction:**
   - The indices `l` and `r` are not correctly adjusted for the changing length of the array. The array is being modified in place, but the indices are not updated properly to reflect the new size of the array after each removal.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The result array `res` is not correctly calculated because the product `ans` is not updated properly during the loop.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = []
        ans = 1
        for i in range(n):
            ans = (ans * arr[i]) % m
            res.append(ans)
            if s[i] == 'L':
                arr.pop(0)
            else:
                arr.pop()
        print(*res)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the product is updated correctly and handles the array modifications properly.
