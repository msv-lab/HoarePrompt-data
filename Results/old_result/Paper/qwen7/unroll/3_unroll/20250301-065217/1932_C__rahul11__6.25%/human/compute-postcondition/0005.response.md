Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( m \), an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers, and a string \( s \) of length \( n \) containing only 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it calculates a sequence of values based on the initial product of the array elements and updates this product according to the directions in the string \( s \). Specifically, if a character in \( s \) is 'L', the product is divided by the current leftmost element in \( a \); if 'R', the product is divided by the current rightmost element in \( a \). Each update is taken modulo \( m \) and then modulo \( 1000000006 \). The function outputs a list \( res \) of length \( n \), where each element \( res[i] \) (for \( 1 \leq i < n \)) represents the product after the \( i \)-th update, and the first element \( res[0] \) is the initial product of all elements in \( a \) reduced modulo \( m \) and then modulo \( 1000000006 \).**
