Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes variables and reads input as specified in the problem statement.
2. **Product Calculation**: The initial product of the array `arr` is calculated and stored in `ans`. This product is then taken modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6` (stored in `MOD`). This is correct according to the problem statement.
3. **Loop Through Commands**: The program iterates through the string `s` and processes each command ('L' or 'R') as specified:
   - For 'L', it divides the product by the leftmost element and updates the product.
   - For 'R', it divides the product by the rightmost element and updates the product.
   - In both cases, the product is taken modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`.
4. **Result Storage**: The results are stored in the list `res` as required by the problem statement.
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where the array becomes empty after processing all commands, which is correctly reflected in the output.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
