Output State: **`max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`, `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `A[index - 1]` to the variable `left` and `A[index]` to the variable `right`. The values of `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged from their initial states.
