Based on the initial state provided:

- `max_diff` is the largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`.
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`.
- `index` is the index of the element where `max_diff` was found.
- `left` is `A[index - 1]`.
- `right` is `A[index]`.
- `ans` is the minimum value among all calculated differences during the loop iterations.

The expression `max(ans, next_max_diff)` will compare `ans` with `next_max_diff` and print the larger of the two values.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider the possible values of `ans` and `next_max_diff`:

- `ans` is the minimum value among all calculated differences during the loop iterations.
- `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference found between consecutive elements in the array `A`.

Given these descriptions, `max(ans, next_max_diff)` will print the larger of these two values. Since `ans` is the minimum value of all calculated differences, it is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `next_max_diff`.

Therefore, the output will be `next_max_diff`.

Output: **next_max_diff**
