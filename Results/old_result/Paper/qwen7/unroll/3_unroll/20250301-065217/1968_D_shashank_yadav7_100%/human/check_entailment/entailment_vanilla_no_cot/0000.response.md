Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
3. **Adjusting Indices**: It adjusts the indices of the starting positions to be zero-based.
4. **Calculating Scores**: It calculates the initial scores for Bodya and Sasha using their starting positions.
5. **Game Loop**: It simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores based on the rules of the game.
6. **Determining Winner**: After the loop, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

The logic in the program correctly handles the game mechanics and scoring, and it outputs the correct result for each test case as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
