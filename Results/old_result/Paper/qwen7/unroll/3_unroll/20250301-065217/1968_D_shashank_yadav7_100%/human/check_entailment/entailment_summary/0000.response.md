Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters: \( n \), \( k \), \( b \), and \( s \).
3. It then reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).
4. The program adjusts the starting positions \( b \) and \( s \) to be zero-indexed.
5. It initializes variables `bm` and `sm` to store the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
6. The program then iterates up to \( k \) times, updating the positions and calculating the maximum possible scores for both players.
7. After the loop, it compares the scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem description and the provided execution summary, the program logic appears to correctly implement the rules of the game and handle all the necessary calculations. There are no apparent errors in the logic or the handling of inputs and outputs.

Correctness: **True**
