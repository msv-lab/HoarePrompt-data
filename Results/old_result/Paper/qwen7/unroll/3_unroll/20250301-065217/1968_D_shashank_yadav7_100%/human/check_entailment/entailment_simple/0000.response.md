Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
3. It converts `P_B` and `P_S` to zero-based indices by subtracting 1.
4. It initializes the scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`) with the initial values of `a[P_B-1]` and `a[P_S-1]` respectively.
5. It also initializes the maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) with these initial values multiplied by `k`.
6. The program then iterates through the permutation, updating the positions of Bodya and Sasha, and recalculating the maximum possible scores for each player until `k` turns are completed.
7. Finally, it compares the maximum possible scores and prints the appropriate outcome ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the problem description and the provided annotated program, the logic seems to accurately follow the rules of the game and correctly determine the winner or if it's a draw. The program handles all the necessary steps and conditions as required.

Correctness: **True**
