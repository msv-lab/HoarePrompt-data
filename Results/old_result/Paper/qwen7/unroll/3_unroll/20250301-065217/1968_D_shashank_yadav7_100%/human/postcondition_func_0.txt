The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads in values for \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( b \), \( s \), a permutation \( p \), and an array \( a \). It then calculates the maximum possible scores for two players, 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', based on the given rules. Finally, it prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on which player has the higher score. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.
