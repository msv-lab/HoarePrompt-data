### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` and converts them to zero-indexed positions by subtracting 1.

2. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are correctly set to the values of `a` at their starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya (`bm`) and Sasha (`sm`) are correctly initialized to the product of `k` and the value of `a` at their starting positions.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program enters a loop that simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - In each iteration, the positions of Bodya and Sasha are updated to their new positions using the permutation `p`.
   - The scores are updated accordingly.
   - The maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha are updated based on the new positions.

4. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After the loop, the program compares the final maximum scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, and 'Draw' if the scores are equal.

### Detailed Check

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input reading and conversion to zero-indexed positions.

2. **Score Calculation:**
   - The initial scores are correctly calculated based on the starting positions.
   - The maximum possible scores are correctly updated during each turn, considering the best possible moves.

3. **Position Updates:**
   - The positions are updated correctly using the permutation `p`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison of scores is done correctly, and the appropriate result is printed.

### Key Points to Validate

- The program correctly updates the positions and scores for each turn.
- The maximum possible scores are correctly calculated and compared.
- The program handles the zero-indexed positions correctly.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the program again, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the rules of the game as described. The program correctly calculates the scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
