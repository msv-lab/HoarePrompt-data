Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the actual value entered as an integer. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a`) are not mentioned in the code and thus remain in their initial unspecified state.
