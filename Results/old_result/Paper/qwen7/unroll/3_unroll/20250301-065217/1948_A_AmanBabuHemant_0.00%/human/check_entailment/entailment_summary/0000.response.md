Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters.
2. A special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
3. The provided solution incorrectly uses '110' to generate the string, which is not composed of uppercase Latin letters.
4. The logic for checking if `n` is odd or even is correct, but the string generation part does not meet the problem requirements.
5. The solution should generate a string using uppercase Latin letters ('A' to 'Z') that satisfies the special character condition.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it uses non-alphabetical characters ('1', '1', '0') instead of uppercase Latin letters.

Correctness: **False**
