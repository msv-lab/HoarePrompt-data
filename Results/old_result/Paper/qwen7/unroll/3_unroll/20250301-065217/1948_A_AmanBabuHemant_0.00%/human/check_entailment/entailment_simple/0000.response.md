Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
- The provided solution checks if `n` is odd. If it is, the program correctly outputs 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string.
- If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` by repeating '110' `n // 2` times. This string will have exactly `n` special characters because each '1' in the pattern '110' is a special character (it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors).
- The program then checks if the constructed string `s` has a length less than 200. If it does, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If not, it prints 'NO'.
- This approach works because the pattern '110' ensures that every '1' is a special character, and the length of the string is always within the constraints (since `n` is at most 50, `n // 2` is at most 25, and thus the length of the string is at most 75, which is well under 200).

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
