Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Checking for Special Characters:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd.
     - If `n` is odd, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd. This is correct according to the problem statement.
     - If `n` is even, it proceeds to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'110' * (n // 2)`.
     - Each segment `'110'` has exactly one special character (the middle '1').
     - Therefore, `s` will have exactly `n // 2` special characters, which is `n` since `n` is even.
   - It then checks if the length of `s` is less than 200.
     - If the length is less than 200, it prints "YES" followed by the constructed string `s`.
     - If the length is 200 or more, it prints "NO".

### Issues in the Program:

1. **String Construction:**
   - The pattern `'110'` does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters. Instead, it uses digits.
   - The problem requires constructing a string of uppercase Latin letters.

2. **Special Character Definition:**
   - The program assumes that the pattern `'110'` generates strings where every '1' is a special character, but the problem specifies that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The pattern `'110'` does not necessarily meet this condition in all cases.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to construct a string where each character is special. One possible approach is to use a repeating pattern like "ABAC" or "ABBA", ensuring that each character is special.

### Revised Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Construct a string with special characters
            s = 'ABAC' * (n // 4) + 'AB' * (n % 4)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the use of digits instead of uppercase Latin letters and the incorrect assumption about the pattern generating special characters. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
