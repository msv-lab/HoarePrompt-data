Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `lex` and calculates a sequence of characters. It then prints three characters for each test case: 'a', 'z', and a character corresponding to the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26. This process is repeated for the number of test cases specified by the user.**
