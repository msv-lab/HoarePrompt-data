You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads an integer `lex` and calculates a sequence of characters. It then prints three characters for each test case: 'a', 'z', and a character corresponding to the remaining value of `lex` after it has been reduced by multiples of 26. This process is repeated for the number of test cases specified by the user.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases` and then iterates over each test case.
   - It correctly reads the encoded value `lex` for each test case.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value `lex` into a three-letter word.
   - However, the logic for decoding is flawed:
     - The program tries to fill the array `arr` with values based on certain conditions, which do not correctly represent the possible values of the letters in the word.
     - Specifically, it incorrectly handles the distribution of the remaining value after assigning initial letters.
     - The conditions `if lex <= 26` and `elif lex < 52` are overly simplistic and do not cover all possible cases for the encoded value.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and prints the corresponding letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`.
   - This part of the code assumes that the array `arr` contains the correct values, which it does not due to the flawed decoding logic.

### Example Test Cases

Let's manually check the decoding process for the given examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `lex = 24`
  - Correct word: "cat"
  - Decoded word: "aav" (Incorrect)

- **Test Case 2**: `lex = 70`
  - Correct word: "rzz"
  - Decoded word: "rzz" (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `lex = 3`
  - Correct word: "aaa"
  - Decoded word: "aaa" (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `lex = 55`
  - Correct word: "czz"
  - Decoded word: "czz" (Correct)

- **Test Case 5**: `lex = 48`
  - Correct word: "auz"
  - Decoded word: "auz" (Correct)

### Conclusion

The program fails to correctly decode the encoded values for most test cases. The logic for distributing the remaining value after assigning initial letters is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not produce the lexicographically smallest word for all test cases.
