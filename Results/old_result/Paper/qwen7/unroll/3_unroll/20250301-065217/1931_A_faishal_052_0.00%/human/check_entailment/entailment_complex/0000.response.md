Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Lexicographical Order**: The program always appends 'a' and 'z' to the array `arr`, which does not ensure that the resulting word is lexicographically smallest. For instance, if `lex` is between 27 and 51, the correct approach should be to set the second character to the appropriate letter rather than always setting it to 'z'.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Characters**: The program incorrectly reduces `lex` by multiples of 26 without considering the correct order of characters. For example, if `lex` is 24, the correct characters should be 'a', 'a', and 'v' ('v' being the 22nd letter), but the program incorrectly handles this scenario.

3. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array `arr` before converting it to characters is unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the lexicographically smallest word.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
