Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Logic for Determining Characters**: 
   - The program attempts to determine the characters of the word based on the remaining value after subtracting multiples of 26. However, it does not handle the correct logic for determining the characters.
   - It incorrectly assumes that the first two characters can always be determined by checking if `lex` is less than or equal to 26 or less than 52, which is not accurate for all cases.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and prints characters based on the sorted values, which does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For `lex = 24`, the expected output is `aav`, but the program might not produce this output due to the incorrect logic.
   - For `lex = 70`, the expected output is `rzz`, but the program might not produce this either.

### Correct Approach:
To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should:
- Determine the largest possible character first (since we want the smallest word).
- Subtract its value from `lex`.
- Repeat the process for the next largest possible character until all three characters are determined.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        word = []
        for j in range(3):
            # Determine the largest possible character
            for k in range(26, 0, -1):
                if lex >= k:
                    word.append(k)
                    lex -= k
                    break
        # Convert numbers to characters
        result = ''.join([chr(num + 96) for num in word])
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is generated for each test case.
