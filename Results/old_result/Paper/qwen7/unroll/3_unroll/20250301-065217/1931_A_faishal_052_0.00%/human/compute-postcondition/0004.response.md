Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, given that for each test case, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

This means the function `func` does not take any parameters but returns an integer `n` that falls within the range of 3 to 78, inclusive. The constraint on `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) seems to be additional context about the possible range of values but does not affect the parameters or return value of the function itself.
