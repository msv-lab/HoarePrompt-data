Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
2. The provided code attempts to achieve this by calculating a sum and printing operations that set the matrix values.
3. The logic in the code seems to aim at setting the matrix in a way that maximizes the sum. Specifically, it sets the first \( r \) rows to have values from 1 to \( n \) and the remaining rows to have values from 1 to \( n \) in a cyclic manner.
4. The code correctly handles the constraints and outputs the required format.
5. The operations described in the code (Type 1 and Type 2) are consistent with the problem statement and do not exceed \( 2n \) operations.

Given these points, the provided code appears to be correct in terms of logic and adherence to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
