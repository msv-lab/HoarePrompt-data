Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the sum of the matrix elements based on some logic involving `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `i * n`, but these calculations do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix using the allowed operations.
   - The sum calculation should be based on the maximum possible value each cell can take, which is `n` (since each cell can hold any value from 1 to n through the operations).

2. **Incorrect Number of Operations**:
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined in a way that does not guarantee the correct number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The correct approach should involve at most `2n` operations, but the current implementation does not ensure this.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program prints operations in a fixed manner without considering the actual values that need to be set in the matrix to achieve the maximum sum.
   - For example, it prints permutations for rows and columns without ensuring that the sum is maximized.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to set each element to its maximum possible value (`n`). This can be achieved by performing `n` type 1 operations to set the values in the first `n` rows and `n` type 2 operations to set the values in the first `n` columns.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        # Perform n type 1 operations to set the first n rows
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Perform n type 2 operations to set the first n columns
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, j, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum
        max_sum = n * n * n
        
        print(max_sum, 2 * n)

# Example usage
func()
```

This version ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized by setting each element to `n` using exactly `2n` operations, which is the minimum required.
