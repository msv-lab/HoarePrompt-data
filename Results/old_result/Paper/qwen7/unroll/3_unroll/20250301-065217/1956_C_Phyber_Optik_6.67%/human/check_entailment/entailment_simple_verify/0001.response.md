### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate in identifying the issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and provide a more detailed analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The current logic for calculating `sum` is incorrect. The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix elements, which can be achieved by strategically placing permutations in rows and columns. The current logic does not reflect this goal.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined in the loop. However, the operations do not correctly follow the rules specified in the problem:
     - Type 1 operations should permute entire rows.
     - Type 2 operations should permute entire columns.
   - The current implementation sets the first row and column to `[1, 2, ..., n]` repeatedly, which does not maximize the sum. This approach does not ensure that the sum is maximized according to the problem constraints.

Given the problem requirements, the correct approach would involve:
- Using Type 1 operations to set the entire first row to a permutation that maximizes the sum.
- Using Type 2 operations to set the entire first column to a permutation that maximizes the sum.

### Correct Approach:
To achieve the maximum sum, we can:
1. Set the first row to `[1, 2, ..., n]` using a Type 1 operation.
2. Set the first column to `[1, 2, ..., n]` using a Type 2 operation.

This ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized because each element in the first row and first column will contribute to the maximum possible value.

### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Set the first row to [1, 2, ..., n]
        print(n * (n + 1) // 2, n)
        print(1, ' '.join(map(str, range(1, n + 1))))
        
        # Set the first column to [1, 2, ..., n]
        for j in range(2, n + 1):
            print(2, j, ' '.join(map(str, range(1, n + 1))))
        
        # The remaining operations can be omitted since we have already used 2n operations
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not follow the rules and does not maximize the sum. The corrected version ensures that the sum is maximized by using the appropriate operations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (Original program is incorrect)

Final: **False**
