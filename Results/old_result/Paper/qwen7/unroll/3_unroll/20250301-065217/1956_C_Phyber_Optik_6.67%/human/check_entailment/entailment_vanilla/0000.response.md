Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates through values from 1 to `n` and calculates `sum` based on the condition:
     - If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, it sets `r = i` and adds `n * (n + 1) // 2` to `sum`.
     - Otherwise, it adds `i * n` to `sum`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program prints the calculated `sum` and `n + r`.
   - It then performs the required operations:
     - For the first `n` operations (if `j <= n`), it prints a Type 1 operation setting the entire first row to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - For the remaining operations (if `j > n`), it prints a Type 2 operation setting the entire first column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The logic for calculating `sum` seems to be incorrect. The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
   - The current logic does not seem to align with the problem statement. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements, which can be achieved by strategically placing permutations in rows and columns.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + r` operations, where `r` is determined in the loop. However, the operations do not seem to follow the rules specified in the problem:
     - Type 1 operations should permute entire rows.
     - Type 2 operations should permute entire columns.
   - The current implementation does not correctly reflect these operations. Instead, it sets the first row and column to `[1, 2, ..., n]` repeatedly, which does not maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not follow the rules for performing Type 1 and Type 2 operations and does not maximize the sum of the matrix elements as required.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
