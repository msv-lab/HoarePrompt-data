Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can both receive invitations such that they both come to the party. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```

In this case, if Monocarp sends invitations to friends 1 and 2, only friend 1 will come because friend 2's best friend (friend 3) did not receive an invitation. Similarly, sending invitations to friends 2 and 3 would result in only friend 2 coming. Sending invitations to friends 3 and 4 would result in only friend 3 coming. Therefore, it is impossible to have at least two friends come to the party with only three invitations.

The program incorrectly prints `3` in this scenario, which is not the minimum number of invitations needed. The correct output should be `3`, but the logic in the program does not account for the possibility that no valid pairs exist, leading to an incorrect solution.
