### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree with \( t = 1 \) (only one round). The game involves moving a stone from one node to another along the edges of the tree, and the player who cannot make a move loses. The goal is to determine the winner based on the parity (odd/even) of the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**: This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree. It uses recursion to traverse the tree and build a list of distances. However, the function does not correctly calculate the distances. Instead, it returns a list of distances extended by 1 for each recursive call, which does not represent the actual shortest path distances.
   - **`func_2`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree representation, identifies the leaf nodes, and calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node. It then checks if any of these distances are odd. If so, it prints "Ron"; otherwise, it prints "Hermione". 

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` for determining the winner is based on the parity of the distances. If there is at least one odd distance, Ron wins because he can always force Hermione into a losing position. Otherwise, Hermione wins.
   - The issue lies in `func_1`. The function should use Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar method to compute the shortest path distances from the starting node to all other nodes. However, the current implementation does not do this correctly.

Given that `func_1` is incorrectly implemented and does not provide the correct distances, the overall logic of the program is flawed. Therefore, the program will not produce the correct results for most test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
