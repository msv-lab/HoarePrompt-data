Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a game played on a tree structure where Ron and Hermione take turns moving a stone from one node to an inactive neighbor. The player who cannot make a move loses. The game is played for `t` rounds, but since `t = 1` in this case, we only need to focus on one round.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function computes the distance from a given starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It correctly handles the base case where the starting node has only one neighbor (itself), returning `[0]`.
   - For other nodes, it recursively calculates distances to all neighbors, excluding the parent node to avoid cycles.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input values for `n` and `t` (which is 1 here).
   - It constructs the tree using adjacency lists.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies the winning player based on the parity of the distances returned by `func_1`.
   - Since the problem specifies that all rounds are played with the same tree and only the starting node changes, the analysis for one round is sufficient.
   - The provided example matches the expected behavior: starting from node 1, the distances to other nodes are calculated, and since at least one distance is odd, Ron wins.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
