Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case contains an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, for each test case, the variable ans represents the number of times the value of y was updated (i.e., when a > y). The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
