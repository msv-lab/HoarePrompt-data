Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which determines the number of iterations.

2. **Understand the Input**: The input is read from the standard input and is used as the argument to the `range` function. This means the loop will run for the number of times equal to the integer input.

3. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid and non-zero for the loop to execute. The variable `t` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), but this is not directly used in the loop. Instead, the loop relies on the input value, which we denote as `num_cases`.

4. **Formulate the State**: We need to ensure that the input value (which we will call `num_cases`) is a positive integer and non-zero for the loop to execute. Given the constraints, `num_cases` must be at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, ensuring it is a positive integer and non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num_cases` is a positive integer and at least 1**
