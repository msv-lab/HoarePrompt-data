State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments with each iteration.
- For the loop `for i in range(t):` to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(t)` generates numbers from 0 to `t-1`.
- The initial value of `i` is set to 0, as per the default behavior of the `range` function when starting from 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.
