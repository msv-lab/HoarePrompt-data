Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func_1()` correctly takes a string `s` as input and converts it into a list of characters. This is necessary because strings in Python are immutable, and we need to modify them, which is easier with a list.
   - The function then iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats, starting from the largest possible length down to 1.

2. **Tandem Repeat Check**:
   - For each possible length `j`, the function checks every possible starting position `k` of the substring of length `j`.
   - It uses a `count` variable to keep track of how many characters match their counterparts `j` positions ahead. If a mismatch occurs, `count` is reset to 0.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `2 * j` and returns, ensuring that the function stops after finding the longest possible tandem repeat.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found during the iteration, the function prints `0`, which is the correct behavior according to the problem statement.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The provided example test cases validate the function's logic. For instance, in the case `"zaabaabz"`, the longest tandem repeat is "aabaa", which has a length of 6. In the case `"?????"`, the longest tandem repeat is "aaaaa" or "bbbbb", both of which have a length of 4. 

Given the above points, the function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the longest possible tandem repeat in the string after replacing '?' with lowercase Latin letters.

Correctness: **True**
