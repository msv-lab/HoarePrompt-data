Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `n` is the length of the list `s`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the list `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` and `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, `t` is still an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` remains a list of characters from the input string. The new information is that `n` is now the length of the list `s`.
