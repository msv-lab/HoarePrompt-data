Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the function `func_1()` should check if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and then verify if `(n - m)` is even. However, the current implementation incorrectly checks if `(n - m)` is even without ensuring that `n` is at least `m`. This means that the program will incorrectly return "Yes" for cases where `n < m`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least the desired number of cubes `m` before checking if the difference `(n - m)` is even.
