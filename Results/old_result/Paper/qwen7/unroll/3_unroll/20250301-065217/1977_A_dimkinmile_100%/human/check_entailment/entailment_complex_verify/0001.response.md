### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates over each test case.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`.
   - This part is also correct.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in this condition. The condition should check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even, because every move changes the parity of the number of cubes in the tower. Therefore, the difference must be even to ensure that the parity of the number of cubes can be balanced to achieve `m` cubes.
   - Additionally, the condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves to add cubes is sufficient to reach `m` cubes. If `n < m`, it would be impossible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing exactly one cube per move.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs "Yes" or "No" for each test case based on the logic implemented.
   - However, the logic itself is flawed as explained above.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is correct. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine if it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes. The correct condition should only check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
