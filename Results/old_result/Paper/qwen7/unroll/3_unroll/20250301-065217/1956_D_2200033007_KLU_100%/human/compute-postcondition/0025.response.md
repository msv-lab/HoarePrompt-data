Postcondition: `is_already_stairs` is `False`, and all elements in the specified slice of `arr` from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` either match their indices or a mismatch was found during the iteration. If `arr[start_index + i]` matches `i`, then `is_already_stairs` remains `False`. Otherwise, `res` contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, and `is_already_stairs` remains `False`. The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called, and the element at `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is equal to `i - 1`.
