Output State: `is_already_stairs` is False.

Explanation: The loop sets `is_already_stairs` to `False` if any element in the specified slice of `arr` does not match its index. Since the loop runs for `i + 1` times, checking each element from `start_index` to `start_index + i`, if even one element does not match its index, `is_already_stairs` will be set to `False`. Given that the initial state of `is_already_stairs` is `True`, it will only remain `True` if all elements in the slice match their indices. Otherwise, it will be set to `False` after the first mismatch.
