### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description and Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice picking the smallest available number that ensures the MEX remains high, and Bob picking the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

2. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate the game logic correctly. It simply counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` and returns the first number that appears exactly once or when the count of a number becomes zero.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal moves of both players. It fails to ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

3. **Test Case Example**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     - **Input**:
       ```
       1
       4
       0 0 1 1
       ```
     - **Expected Output**: `2`
     - **Actual Output**:
       The provided code will output `1` instead of `2`.

4. **Optimal Game Play**:
   - According to the optimal strategy:
     1. Alice picks `0` (smallest available number).
     2. Bob picks `0` (next smallest available number).
     3. Alice picks `1` (next smallest available number).
     4. Bob picks `1` (only remaining number).

   - The resulting array `c` is `[0, 1]`, and the MEX is `2`.

5. **Code Behavior**:
   - The current implementation does not simulate the optimal game play. It simply counts occurrences and returns the first number that meets the criteria, which does not align with the optimal strategy.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
