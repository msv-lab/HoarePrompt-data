Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(N):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop are `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given state, `N` is an input integer.
   - `i` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is initialized to 0 in the `range(N)` function.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`.
   - Therefore, the loop can execute if `N` is at least 1 (since `i` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - We need to ensure that `N` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`N` must be at least 1**
