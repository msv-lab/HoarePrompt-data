You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (each less than `n`). For each test case, the function counts the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. It then determines and returns the smallest integer `i` such that either `cnt[i] == 1` (indicating `i` appears exactly once in the list `a`) or `t` becomes greater than or equal to 2. If no such integer is found, the function returns the last integer `i` processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.
   
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the size of the array `N`.
   - It reads the elements of the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through the range `[0, N)` to check how many unique elements have exactly one occurrence (`cnt[i] == 1`).
   - If at any point, the count of such unique elements reaches 2 or more, or if there is no occurrence of a particular index `i`, it returns `i`.

### Problem Description and Requirements

- **Game Rules**:
  - Alice can only pick elements that still exist in `a`.
  - Bob can pick any element from `a` without restrictions.
  - Alice starts first.
  - The game ends when `a` is empty.
  - The score is the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice's choices.

### Key Points to Consider

1. **Alice's Strategy**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - She should try to ensure that as many small numbers as possible are included in `c`.

2. **Bob's Strategy**:
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.
   - He should try to remove elements that could potentially be the MEX.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available number that hasn't been picked yet.
   - Bob will always pick the largest available number to reduce the potential MEX.

### Issues in the Given Program

- **Counting Unique Elements**: The current logic counts the occurrences of each element but does not simulate the actual game play.
- **Return Value**: The function returns the first `i` where either condition is met, which does not align with the game rules.
- **Simulating Game Play**: The function does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and does not build the array `c` as per the game rules.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game play and keep track of the choices made by Alice and Bob. Here’s a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize counters
    alice_choices = []
    bob_choices = []
    
    i = 0
    j = 0
    
    while i < N and j < N:
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
            if a[i] not in bob_choices:
                alice_choices.append(a[i])
                a.pop(i)
                i += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        else:  # Bob's turn
            if a[j] not in alice_choices:
                bob_choices.append(a[j])
                a.pop(j)
                j += 1
            else:
                j += 1
    
    # Calculate MEX of Alice's choices
    mex = 0
    seen = set(alice_choices)
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    
    return mex

for tc in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())
```
