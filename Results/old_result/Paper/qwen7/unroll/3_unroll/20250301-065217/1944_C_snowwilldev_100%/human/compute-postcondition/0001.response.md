Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4, `N` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, and converts each element to an integer using the `map` function. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `t` and `N` remain unchanged from their initial state.
