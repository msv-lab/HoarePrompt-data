Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- For each test case, the function checks the values of n, x, and y.
- It also verifies that the x integers provided are distinct and within the range from 1 to n.
- The specific output for each test case is not detailed in the provided information, so the exact return value for each case is not specified here.
