Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where the chosen vertices are consecutive or nearly consecutive, which can significantly affect the number of triangles that can be formed.

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the program calculates the number of triangles as follows:
- `x = 2` (vertices chosen by Bessie)
- `y = 2` (additional vertices you can choose)
- The formula `ans = x + y - 2` gives `ans = 2 + 2 - 2 = 2`.

However, the correct approach is to consider the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose. For the vertices `1` and `3`, you can choose `2` and `4` to form 2 triangles:
- Triangle 1: Vertices 1, 2, 3
- Triangle 2: Vertices 2, 3, 4

Thus, the correct answer should be `2` triangles, but the program incorrectly returns `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to properly account for the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can choose, ensuring that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is calculated accurately.
