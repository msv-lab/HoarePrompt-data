Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of sub-cases, followed by t pairs of integers. For each pair, the first integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) represents the number of integers in the second line, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each sub-case and returns a result for each, but the specific results are not detailed here.**

This means the function reads multiple test cases from an input source, where each test case starts with an integer t, indicating the number of sub-cases to follow. Each sub-case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. The function then processes these inputs and produces a result for each sub-case, though the nature of these results is not specified in the given information.
