Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The logic in the program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

To solve this problem correctly, you should rearrange the array such that the largest values are placed in positions where they will contribute positively to the sum and the smallest values are placed where they will contribute negatively. Specifically, sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences between consecutive elements will yield the maximum beauty.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = sorted([int(x) for x in input().split()])
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

This program sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which maximizes the beauty according to the problem statement.
