Reasoning:
The provided function aims to calculate the maximum beauty of the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each test case. However, the logic in the function is flawed because it only considers the maximum and minimum values of the entire list for each test case, rather than rearranging the elements to maximize the beauty according to the given formula.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Sorting ensures that the largest possible differences are used, thus maximizing the beauty.

Given the current implementation, the function does not correctly rearrange the elements to achieve the maximum beauty. Instead, it simply finds the max and min values and subtracts them, which does not necessarily yield the maximum possible beauty.

Therefore, the provided function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
