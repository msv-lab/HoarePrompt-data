Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the maximum possible beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. However, the provided solution only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case. This approach does not account for rearranging the elements to maximize the beauty.

To correctly solve the problem, we should sort the array and then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The provided solution fails to implement this logic.

Correctness: **False**
