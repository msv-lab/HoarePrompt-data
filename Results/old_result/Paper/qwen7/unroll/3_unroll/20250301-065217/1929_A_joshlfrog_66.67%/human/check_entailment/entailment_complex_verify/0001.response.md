### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not solve the problem as stated. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

The problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. The given program does not perform any rearrangement; instead, it simply finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates their difference. This approach does not consider the arrangement of elements to maximize the beauty.

Given the problem constraints and the requirement to maximize the beauty by rearranging the array, the provided solution is incorrect. The program should sort the array and then compute the beauty as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to account for the necessary rearrangement of the array to maximize the beauty, and instead, it calculates an incorrect value.
